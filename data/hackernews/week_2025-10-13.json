          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "This is very cool. Here is something I'm struggling with as a user. I look at a product (this tofu for example [0]) and see the amounts. And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be? reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

I hope we can agree that we are better off than that now. What I'm curious about is whether you think it's been a steady stream of improvements, and we just need to improve further? Or if you think there was some point between 1900 and now where food health and safety was maximized, greater than either 1900 or now, and we've regressed since then? reply",

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "Those algorithms implement so random to me, with lack of explanation, no test cases, no formal proof, and often inconsistent naming or structure across languages. Many repositories like TheAlgorithms are great collections, but they feel more like code dumps than true learning resources. You can find an implementation of Dijkstra or QuickSort, but often there is no context: why it works, how to prove it correct, what the complexity is, or how to test it against edge cases. For someone who wants to learn algorithms deeply, that missing layer of reasoning and validation is critical. No organization for learners either. It jumps straight into implementations without a logical flow from fundamentals. I want to build something more structured: start from the very foundation (like data structures, recursion, and complexity analysis), then move to classical algorithms (search, sort, graph, dynamic programming), and eventually extend to database internals, optimization, and even machine learning or AI algorithms. Basically, a single consistent roadmap from beginner to researcher level, where every algorithm connects to the next and builds intuition step by step. Another very good resource for beginners is https://www.hello-algo.com . At first, i actually wanted to contribute there, since it explains algorithms visually and in simple language. But it mostly covers the basics and stops before more advanced or applied topics. I want to go deeper and treat algorithms as both code and theory, with mathematical rigor and formal proofs where possible. That is something I really liked about Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and of course The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) by Knuth. They combine reasoning, math, and practice. My goal is to make something in that spirit, but more practical and modern, bridging the gap between academic books and messy open source repos. reply",

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.  And some data visualizations as in Sedgewick's book would also be helpful. reply",

          "text": "Currently working on an open source Heroku / Fly.io / Render alternative: https://canine.sh Its built on top of Kubernetes, based on learnings I've had from previous experiences scaling infrastructure. If you look at the markup PaaS (Heroku, Fly, Render) applies to IaaS (AWS, Hetzner), it's on the order of 5-10x. But not having that, and trying to stitch together random AWS services is a huge PITA for a medium sized engineering team (we've tried). On top of all that, theres a whole host of benefits to being on kubernetes, namely, that you can install any helm package with one click, which Canine also manages. A good example is Sentry -- even though it has an open source offering, almost everyone pays for the cloud version because its too scary to self host. With Canine, its a one click, and you get a sentry.your-domain.com to use for whatever you need. Recently got a sponsorship from the Portainer team to allow me to dedicate way more time to this project, so hugely grateful to them for that. Code: https://github.com/czhu12/canine reply",

Yes, can be expensive computationally that's why the city is so small (for now) but as I start to distribute the simulation into many cores, players with high core CPU will be able to choose a bigger city size :) I agree that individual level simulation is what makes it interesting and I plan to keep it like that. reply",

          "text": "My second favorite “Wild, Wild, Country”, but it was mentioned already at the top of the first list.  I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages. The kind of thing where you could miss a bracket on line 47 but end up with a compiler error complaining about something 20 lines away.

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

I'm seeing a bunch of Samsung, LG, RCA, Sony, etc on Facebook Marketplace. What a cesspool Facebook has become, right?<p>Any suggestions on the best brand or even model for that kind of thing? I don't really want to battle with a bunch of shit that tries to coerce me to install another app from a streaming provider slash gambling entrypoint.<p>I imagine mostly it will just need HDMI to work, and all the TVs will support that.

          "text": "Do recommend the LG C series (C5 or C4 are new or the C1 series if you want a deal on classifieds - same hardware as the higher end models but needs a firmware bit flip). The OS is very rootable and it makes a great TV that doubles as a monitor. Supports free sync / g-sync. OLED is nice at this scale. Text is very readable, refresh rate is good. It uses the same panels as the fancier G series in the larger sizes. One can root the firmware to make it go brighter. (Though this is screen works well in medium or dimly lit rooms. It does not shine in very bright rooms). Plenty of YouTube videos singing the C series praises as a TV / Monitor.[1] LG webOS is also trivial/friendly to root in developer mode and network control of the tv is a nice to have. Would avoid Samsung. I love the matte on the Frame and the design of the Serif but the OS is frustrating / impractical to root. [1] https://youtu.be/Qtve0u3GJ9Y reply",

My \"favorite\" feature is that when I use an app like Netflix and then press the \"Exit\" button on the remote there's a 50% chance I just land back on my desktop and a 50% chance that the menu that covers the bottom third of the screen is open. It can also frequently not find the signal of the computer, maybe 1 in 50 times. Sometimes it'll connect in a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes after replugging the HDMI, and sometimes updating the screen by doing things like pressing buttons that would cause something to change (my computer neither hybernates nor goes to sleep). Not to mention that it frequently will ask me to update the terms of service (I cannot reject them, I can only select \"remind me later\" and it starts to get aggressive) and it will change some settings when it force updates on me.

          "text": "Another +1 for LG but it's worth mentioning that there are a few things that a TV firmware does that you don't necessarily want in a Monitor. Simple example: most TVs will stay on _forever_ with the \"no signal\" image bouncing around... but a proper monitor will interpret that as a sign that the PC has gone to sleep so the monitor should, too. I have not looked into hacking the firmware to change this behavior but if there's a \"custom rom\" out there that can do this, I'd appreciate a link! One of the best things about LG in general is their serial port.\nIt's hit/miss which of their models will have it exposed on the back, but if yours does,  the protocol is well documented and is very simple. My LG TV (used as a monitor) is really chatty on the network and so I keep it disconnected so I don't get periodic interruptions from little overlays telling me that $someApp has been updated and needs me to agree to new terms (yes, really!). To re-gain remote control for automation, I use the serial port. I have an ESP32 connected to a mmWave sensor for active \"at desk?\" detection. This is integrated with Home Assistant which knows which PC my KVM is pointing to and if it's on or not. This lets me re-implement basic \"if not at desk and no PC is on, put the display to sleep\" automation. My biggest complaint is more of an ecosystem issue; why is DisplayPort not common on TVs? Because this TV-As-A-Monitor is HDMI only, my KVM has to be HDMI and so does every PC that's hooked up. Would have been a lot nicer if the whole chain could be display port :/. reply",

          "text": "If you were using a TV streaming stick, many have slow Ethernet due to slow port (Micro-USB), slow PHY hardware (100 mbps) or slow network stack. For the popular streaming apps they only need 25 mbps max, so most stick makers put no effort into design or validation testing beyond that minimal use case. And they don't care about latency. I use Moonlight via direct 1 gbps Ethernet from a high-end gaming PC in the same house through a Google Chromecast 4K HDMI dongle with a powered USB-C hub for the RJ-45 input and it works flawlessly at 60 fps 4K 10-bit HDR with around 12 ms video latency. Some USB 3 hubs and USB Ethernet dongles won't reach full speeds on some streaming devices USB ports. The second one I tried worked at full 1 gbps. You have to verify every software and hardware component in the chain is working at high-speed/low latency in your environment with a local speed test hosted on your source machine. I used self-hosted OpenSpeedTest. Moonlight works great but none of the consumer streaming stick or USB hub/RJ-45 dongles test for high speed/low latency across dozens of different device port hardware/firmware combos - so you can't trust claimed specs. Assume it's slow until you verify it's not. reply",

          "text": "This is correct and the general sentiment and experience among professionals. Starting in late 2022, there's been a coordinated assault on industry by AI, both in terms of false marketing (execs thinking they can replace all their workers), and in terms of torturous interference (ghost candidates/ghost jobs) imposing cost on all candidates (and business alike). It has demonstrated a number of important things some which are just bad for industry in the long-run like the resilience built-in to architecture by competent people may have been ill-thought out. People used to automate away the boring stuff, but when that boring stuff doesn't break for 2 years because of design, they can just let you go for that time. They lose out the value of becoming leaner, and coping with emergencies but few people after this are setting up fully resilient architecture. You can't pay enough for the demonstrated downside. There's been a critical loss of credibility on the industry by these actions. I would reiterate and corroborate that LinkedIn and Indeed are worthless for hiring. They do not curate the people they allow to advertise for jobs. There are many fake company spinoffs for non-existent roles that use the personalized CV data for something else. These fake companies lead you on, use AI to eat up your time, and often fail a more thorough background check into public records using OSINT. (i.e. quite a number have owners who were in obituaries with paperwork filed after their deaths). For real data, the average cold-submit of CV to interview ratio has been around 1:1200 for LI/Indeed. These have been custom tailored for the positions, for an individual with a decade of experience as an expert generalist (Linux & Windows Ecosystems both on-prem and Cloud-tenant based), with deep expertise in helpdesk at all SLA tier levels, System/Network Admin roles/Principal Engineer, and DevOps/Architect roles. Unable to find work in two years of massive unrelenting week-by-week effort, a good number of competent techies are now retraining. The brain drain on industry caused by this is massive and shouldn't be overlooked but appears to be. Some might think to say this is just a bad economy. Tech has never been correlated with the driving factors of the economy. Interest rate increases, and financial crises have come and gone in the past with no observable change in tech. This is a disruption-based economy, and its unhinged. This appears to be purely the work of factor market manipulation by oligopoly, to glut the factor market and stall the economy for profit. The same things that happen when you fire your people, raise prises, and lower production which often ends in a vicious doom cycle since lack of money in circulation lowers the amount of customers, which drives more firing in deflationary spirals which are common under regimes of money-printing given sufficient time. reply",

For me Dragon was pretty much unusable without expensive microphone setup. And even then, it needed constant intervention for punctuation and formatting. Here's an example of what I mean. In these tests, I just spoke the words, I did not dictate any punctuation. Mistakes annotated by ~ VoiceBuddy (with microphone built into my cheap Logitech Webcam):\nThe color of animals is by no means a matter of choice. It depends on many considerations, but in the majority of the cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there are to be but few brightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are themselves protective.

          "text": "I am a lead software engineer with 12 years of experience and a recent master's degree in cybersecurity. I use GitHub CoPilot everyday. I usually limit it to a fancy auto-complete. It's really helpful for repetitive refactor tasks, I just have to go to each line and it updates. This way I still see what's happening, but it is faster than manually making those changes that can't be solved with a find and replace. Sometimes I fight CoPilot because it will continue to suggest something I do not want to do. In those instances I code faster as to outpace the AI's latency. Other devs are building MCP servers to help access our tools for AI integration. Devops seems heavy on spec driven and test driven development through AI. The spec driven development looks interesting, but a bit of overhead to get started. Our company has an AI first directive right now where we're supposed to use AI for everything and see what works. I somewhat disdain it, but it's also fun to have a directive to try new things indiscriminately (using AI). The more I drink the Kool aid, the better it tastes. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had discussed this on here for like 7-8 days ago but I can't get to know the reason why. I have thought about it for hours, thinking I have finally understood the reason why, but it seems that the only thing I know is that I know nothing.<p>My question is simple. Why are people uneducated about foss and how to really change that.<p>I have thought about what might be the best way to spread the word about foss and it seems that the best way is via advocating things like f-droid and linux mate/flatpak/ making things so simple that there is no reason why not.<p>Yet then I think that the reason why people are still not interested is that it becomes <i>too</i> boring.<p>Am I really in control if all my moves are being tracked. I am not sure. Do people not know this?<p>I want to raise awareness about oss since its something I am passionate about. Yet I can't seem to know how. I feel heard talking about these issues, its so easy convincing people sometimes to use signal yet they still don't have it. Its mixed bag.<p>I feel like my generation has left me a lot more too, we have stopped even questioning it and we are all so polarized by algorithms tracking us all.<p>I feel like in a world of such polarization, using open source can help to slowly raise awareness about it so that we can then move away from extreme privacy invasise ragebaits inducing algorithms to something better, so that then we can lessen our senses and stop with oh its the end of all and nothing matters nihilism or yeah who cares kind of idea.<p>Sometimes I feel like my ideas don't matter, maybe you could say things like youtube are a mic for people like my ideas but its not. I don't want to create any lore about me, I just want to tell people about stupid simple foss things like f-droid and leave in my opinion so that I could then work on/help other pressing issues in open source.<p>People also feel entitled to good quality open source software, like if that's what you expect, either be so kind to thank the developer and kindly ask them an solution or join their community and kindly ask there or maybe donate to them/contribute to it yourselves. I see people who are entitled and its :/<p>I thank every open source developer, its like something so elegant to me, we can have forks and so many other things and we all learn from each other and its sometimes refreshing. Yet it saddens me that it doesn't receive donations, that people don't use it, that people feel entitled sometimes asking for a feature.<p>This rabbit hole is so deep but if we want to share it with the masses, then we need to discuss the priorities of what to share and what not to for begineers. We need a genuine wiki to get started into the open source lifestyle. I don't know how I started, maybe by just using linux and then searching for any software and writing alternativeto X open source something and so many other things...<p>Awesome-privacy helped me out a ton in the beginning as well. I actually read it whole and privacyguides.net and so many others, there are so many good guides yet they still don't get attention.<p>So should people create another guide to split the attention even more or should they actually redirect attention to lists which we might discuss is good enough for everyone. I have so many questions.<p>We can have better things and that gives me hope. But the problem is that, it doesn't require myself to change but the world in the process a little as well and that confuses me.<p>Do I have the power to change the world in this direction or not? Do any one of us have it? I feel small in this system yet I know giving hope would be mixed too. I don't want to be sad for something out of my control, but that is the question, is this thing out of our control or not? \nI feel like I don't know its answer. \nI just don't know which is why I am asking here. But I still want to be hopeful y'know.<p>Have a nice day and looking forward to each and every one of your comments!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I wake up in the morning, get on my iPhone that synced all of its data to iCloud so if it falls in the river tomorrow, I pick up another one and keep moving. I talk to my wife about our budget while we are making changes on our individual phones that are synced in real time on Google Sheets. I walk over to my home office and open my MacBook Pro with 16 hours battery life that runs silent.  I put on my AirPods Pro that magically pair to all six of my devices and switch between them. I log onto Slack to check the various groups and then use Zoom and Gong that transcribes and summarizes the call using an LLM. I then might use Google’s NotebookLM to consolidate all of the transcripts and documentation to summarize and to ask questions. True I use VSCode that might be open source and has some propriety bits.  I then launch Docker Desktop and start doing some coding depending on the day of the week along with some type of AI coding assistant. Of course there are all of the SaaS apps that I use during the day - Salesforce, Notion, GSuite, Rippling (a YC company), etc. Tell me how is open source going to make my life better where I am not using it? Of course I know Node, Python, the underpinnings of MacOS etc are open source. I am “educated on open source”.  Why would I want to make my life harder or why would a company want to make their life harder by caring about a philosophy?  My goal and the company I work for want to make their life as easy as possible. None of what you said is a convincing argument. reply",

          "text": "Hey, appreciate your response! Now, my hn post was actually longer than 4000 and that's why I had to trim otherwise I would've had maybe explained the question but I will try to write a short answer in here. > Why should they care? What does open source give you? Open source gives people complete freedom, the freedom that a software can run for posterity, can be modified towards your liking, and the most important thing which I failed to mention: peace of mind Most open source software can be run with peace of mind. No subscriptions. No update that enshittens it. If it works and you like it, its yours. No spying on you. No showing you ads which will try to radicalize you or sell you some scammy course as an example. Its just there... saying hi to you, saying how's your day, oh you want to use me, fine, how can I help you today. And it expects nothing back in return. Its just there waiting to be used. People should care because of this, for peace of mind. its almost always worth it in my opinion. I genuinely think that although I didn't mention but even small steps like using f-droid and then transitioning to linux to then transition to mastodon/bluesky as an example can definitely help reducing the reliance on algorithms as well, it can stop spying on us via using things like signal. I'd recommend you to check out the clippy movement by louis rousman. I sort of resonate with the same statement and I agree with the right to repair as well, sure I am not much of a hardware tinkering person but the fact that I can go to a mechanic who can repair easily or have an ability to learn it myself via repair friendly systems is always nice to have and I agree with that thing too. I hope that the clippy movement can sort of bring both the things together which I think it already does. Clippy movement is great actually & explains the reason why people should care, but I have also tried to give some of my own rationale behind it as well. Personally, the reason I got into open source was because of privacy. I started learning more and more about privacy and uh, the final straw on the camel's back for me was when I learnt valorant was installed kernel level and there's no way you can 100% guarantee its removed without deleting the whole system. Downloaded linux and kind of never moved back and got into a rabbit hole. (The only time I used windows was in a vm/winboat app to run a tool which could root my phone but that company's otp server didn't work or anything and so my phone can't be rooted but yeah:<) I like linux but I think that there are so many low hanging fruits like f-droid and signal that people don't even use them man. I would talk about linux/cli tools then when people show the initiative of having f-droid/signal. I think that we need to first educate people about these tools because they are genuinely better than their alternatives and just so good that its almost always worth it to have them on your phone/systems reply",

The community (which is often part of the sales pitch) is a minefield to navigate, you have to put in the time to understand the ideology or face its wrath. The general drama of OSS.

What if I told ya that facebook allegedly detected when teen girls deleted selfies so it could serve them beauty ads. Did you know that? Do most population know how deeply privacy invasive ads are. Yes, we might be vocal about it but that's because we care. We care enough for the world to not want it to be a privacy nightmare dystopia and we are advocating it in ways we can take action in. There are people on the political side of things too which are taking action on stronger regulation but I deeply think that politics is so bundled with corruption all across the world that instead of us relying on politics to fix these companies, we need to use open source/stop watching closed algorithmic things and use things like mastodon to slowly get more normal so that we can then discuss things and fix politics/politicians to remove corruption. How can we do this if the world has created a divide between two parties all across the world and its only fueled by the proprietory algorithmic worlds? How can people care about it if they can't even care about open source in general. I think that if people care about open source/privacy it can be gateway to a better future for us all & this is why we share it. > If you want to change people you have to be willing to be changed by them. Like, okay but we change people through logic and reasoning and discussion. Everyone gets changed by a good discussion, you take in more perspectives, I took from this conversation that open source is a chicken and egg problem. People want good UI/UX and support but how many people donate to open source so that either it can get to that state or just have more people willing to open source instead of making yet another saas... not many Now, that being said, we can reason about things, maybe I can convince you, maybe not. I just believe this notion to be a little anti-scientific really in the sense, that the mere idea of me wanting to change them shouldn't make me change myself, but that I am always willing to be changed if they can provide reason but from a bird's eye view, I am pretty comfortable that my logic doesn't have much gaps, I have thought about it for atleast a month straight. But I am more than willing to correct myself but the way you word it makes me feel like you want me to change more than be willing to change yourself as well and you might feel the same for me but we are both so convinced by two different realities that we live in. But if you put that aside and genuinely just want a discussion, not wanting to change me or change you but this notion of should we even change people or how can we change people, I am more than willing to discuss. And also maybe change isn't that bad after all :) reply",

Now they can install termux and then go be one of us but then again not gui/cognitive load. So there is f-droid. Also, its not that hard finding some genuinely cool foss stuff I wanted a pdf reader on android and I searched open source pdf editor and tried 2-3 and some had poor UX and UI but then I found MJPdf (as an example) https://github.com/mudlej/mj_pdf/ and I found it to be the most superior UI/UX I have seen for a pdf editor. Same goes for my browser. Zen-browser has the best UI/UX for browser based system. Its just so cool. I love it with Ublock origin. I can give you some software I can personally vouch for the good UI/UX and compile a list but would that really matter? I just thought of this idea, also another idea for a good gui is that its kind of hard and requires a language like dart/kotlin which I am not familiar with/ don't actively like (I haven't tried them) I want to make good android apps in golang but I know I sort of can't make it or its a bunch of hacks/(not worth it?) but there are apps which do that too. Also I am not sure how you can have marketing for open source apps when the devs sometimes if the app is a service run them at a loss financially and invest their time into it. If we can't expect donations to be made to them, I don't think we can expect this as well, can we? The incentives system for foss is broken imo but I am not sure how changing it can happen. reply",

Let's leave aside for the moment that pretty much all (with a few notable exceptions), OSS software compares terribly to commercial software.

When an objective person, 97% of whom have never seen a command line interface, or actually installed ANY OS ever take one look and see a big pile of pre-fan supplements. I say this as someone who makes use of OSS software every day. There is outstanding OSS software available. I could list many great nuggets. Categorizing software as good or bad based on the license is probably the least useful way to do it. All licenses, commercial or open, cover software that's mostly rubbish, with occasional good offerings. You may as well evangelize red cars as being better than blue cars.

People care about the license because if the license is, let's say source available and a commercial license on the side, then the problem is that the software stops being permanent and relies on that company. Why so? Because if the company let's say enshittens the project in one version, and the community starts using the last version that wasn't enshittened, they inevitably lose out on bug fixes / qol updates etc. now you might say that people should fork it. But nobody really likes forking a repository with source available license either because of the license or because the company itself would benefit more from the code updates that they write and use it themselves or sell their version as well due to the commerical offerings or the dev's would simply be less willing to due to all of such things. I am not a license purist. I like https://anticapitalist.software/ (Acap license) the most, its because I don't like some commercial usage which would've just taken my labour for it is and not donate to me if I write some software In general, the ACSL is a good match for software that would have otherwise been permissively licensed under MIT, ISC, or BSD but with restrictions against corporate usage.\nHere is an excerpt from ACSL: The ACSL is right for you if you want your code to empower students, artists, hobbyists, collectives, cooperatives and nonprofits to survive under capitalism while not contributing free labor to corporations. The ACSL is right for you if you reject the status quo, believe better things are possible, and want to act on your beliefs. The ACSL is right for you if you carry a new world in your heart, and in your code. That being said, I don't mind licenses that much, source available can be fine too for a peace of mind at-least. If there is any source available license which requires a one time license or something,I think its okay. So I am not sure how somebody is selling the license. The license is a little important, but the battle is against proprietory vs source-code available. The battle is between complete black box vs something you can look inside and have peace of mind. reply",

The result of data harvesting is not a breach. but the whole system that it is right now, for all such data harvesting imo, the most common fraction seems to be hate which gets the most engagement which is why to me most social media feels hateful off the start and why its linked to some of the issues we have right now. Its definitely escalated. There are some genuine problems in economies all around the world yet if those nations leaders try to scapegoat, trying to create a us vs them, its not a good fix and shit might break and we would all be too invested in watching yt shorts. What I am advocating with foss is also federation/curated social media with no algorithms but that is the step two imo. The step one to mass adoption for such things might be to have people more familiar/comfortable with open source. Overall, we need to fight on both fronts if we want change. Both algorithmic and open source apps based. Some open source apps are predatory, they will charge you recurring and hope you forget. Some cheap/quickly built games which can be open source for android for all purposes aren't open source right now and they exploit children's lack of financial knowledge in that sense(scams of sorts). I think people will create 10$ subscriptions to a local text editor in this world. I just wish instead of people spending those 10$ there or somewhere else, why can't we donate to open source as a society so that the software can be more complete/helpful to even more people and so on and so on...

Years pass and some simple things that are a no-brainer in Photoshop are still a nightmare to do in GIMP. Text stroke is one of such examples, there's no easy way to do it with GIMP and the method you can see online looks bad and can't be easily changed afterwards. Why? Or something as simple as picking a size of a brush - why is selecting small sizes such a pain while selecting gigantic brushes that hardly anyone uses is not? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Desktop Linux is an another example. It's always presented as an alternative to Windows (or even better than Windows) and when someone tries it out and it doesn't work for them the end user gets blamed for using the wrong distribution, having wrong hardware, not being able to solve issues right away despite being a beginner or even hit with the legendary \"works on my machine\". It's always the user who is in the wrong and never the software. All of this gives OSS a bad name. There are always a bunch of small, annoying problems that affects end users and which often go unfixed for years. Whenever one of these end users brings up these problems they either get told to use a bizarre workaround or get a snarky response about submitting a PR or something. This kind of contempt towards the end user seems to be surprisingly common in OSS circles. I don't think this is fixable.

Main Street is not really any better at seeing through hype cycles than anyone else, but they are less up-to-date on what is currently hyped, and they also are more likely to think that they hired the programmer to make technical decisions, rather than wanting to make those technical decisions themselves.  They have other (often equally technical) decisions to concentrate on, in different areas, so they are wanting you to just Make It Work. The downside is they are unimpressed with refactoring, updating to new versions, and the like.  The upside is they are ok with you using boring technology that works, even at times when a VC-backed tech company would insist on something new and overcomplicated. Also, the pay is ok, but honestly it's not going to be as high as in VC-backed employers. reply",

Leaving corporate tech jobs is already a big enough hit to TC. Getting out of VC-funded tech very often means a dramatic change in life style. The VC world might be insane, but so is the comp. It's not just the money. The biggest thing I've notice in my career is that, as a general rule, employers value you (or any resource for that matter) in proportion to how much they pay for you. Often people have the illusion that getting paid $80k a year when you used to make $300k will mean that your employer will recognize that you are a tremendous value. They won't. they'll see you and treat you as a low tier worker that can easily be replaced, has timed breaks and 30 minutes for lunch. reply",

I’ve worked at only one startup. We IPO’d. I did pretty good and I joined a unicorn at like series B. Enough to go a decade figuring out what I want to work on next. Most of my other friends went to work at other startups. Most of them went bust and they made nothing but their base salary (and a couple of them got screwed on that too). So unless someone’s working at an actual unicorn like I was it’s really no guarantee. FWIW I made 8x on my latest shares, and multiples on that on earliest. Some people I know who had been there a few years more than me walked away with many more Ms which ain’t bad for 6-8 years of work. But that is SUPER lucky. It has sort of ruined my outlook too because I have no interest making 250k base + 200k RSUs, and I have zero interest in most of these current startups that I have a good hunch will not work out. And 400k isn’t that meaningful anymore, I’d rather live off interest or work as a barista if my own startup doesn’t work out. reply",

          "text": "These are mutually exclusive states, actually. The \"chance at making FU money\" and \"100% more work/stress\" and \"losing funding or... goes bust and can't make payroll\", that's stuff that happens at startups that are paying _below_ the VC-backed market rate. Once a company gets money to be paying employees in the third hump of the trimodal distribution of SWE pay, those \"exciting\" parts are long gone. You're no longer in the running to receive a hilarious amount of money should everything 10-100x, and you're no longer worried about going bust and not making payroll. Even a pre-series A startup I worked at saw the writing on the wall with 5 months of runway left and switched from trying to get funded to finding an M&A deal. At the very least you can get the team acquired by someone in the expansion phase and get the rare chance to interview as a group and compare notes and have an exec try and negotiate your salary _up_ for once. By the time a startup is paying VC-backed market rate, the level of stress you have just comes from the usual suspects: management, culture toxicity, etc. some of that you can absorb, some might prompt you to find a new job, just like normal. There's still a level of \"hoo-rah, we're a startup\" present of course, but I just consider this a bad attempt to keep the magic of when the company and products were small alive. I let it affect me none. reply",

If they had to pay a lot extra for you, the wisdom goes, they will imagine that you must have been worth it, and will take you more seriously. If they paid bargain basement price for you, well, I suppose the same psychology applies. (I was reminded of this folk wisdom last week, by a couple hints in an interview.  It's a bit tricky to filter out startup employers who only want midrange commodity skillsets, when you're willing to take a lower salary in exchange for meaningful equity.  While many of them are thinking of workers as generic commodities (and necessary evils, to the real stars who are the founders), and valuing these hires based on salary they are willing to entertain.) reply",

I see so much opportunity for a small medium business consultation in the analytics and process space but these companies are like really strapped for money and largely set in their ways in my experience. In my experience, people are open to solving their problems. It’s just the money is hard making it financially viable so it’s just the big money is just like an order of magnitude smaller. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I think the general level of sort of like process thinking and data driven decision making in tech is at just like a higher baseline than on Main Street A lot of my discussions are challenging how to sort of like present the problem in a way that somebody that doesn’t have decades of experience and operations understands. Another challenge that I face regularly with Main Street companies is just people seem to be happy like they’re not trying to continuously optimize like I’m used to doing coming for a big tech. Even when it’s easy to present like positive ROI opportunities there’s just like a comfort with the way things are done and a lot of people seem just happy governed by their scaling factors in exchange for that that comfort. TLDR; challenges are financial and mentality. reply",

Normally too early for VC, and often very shiny thing, or polishing things expected to be shiny in the future. I've only once worked on main street when I was managing the app for a pizza chain. One day, sitting in a quarterly planning meeting for the pizza company, they were discussing changes they could make to the app and the comment that stood out in my head was \"we forecast this change could help us sell x% more garlic bread\". In my head I thought, \"I don't care how much garlic bread we sell...this is not why I'm on the planet\". I know not every mains st. business is selling pizza, and lots of B2B companies, VC backed or not, would not excite me. You're right, helping investors make money isn't very compelling, and I think B2B, has that kind of focus, but many ventures aren't B2B SaaS.

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5.

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

          "text": "This is very cool. Here is something I'm struggling with as a user. I look at a product (this tofu for example [0]) and see the amounts. And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

          "text": "I am working on the little book of algorithms: https://github.com/little-book-of/algorithms A project to implement 1000 algorithms. I have finished around 400 so far and I am now focusing on adding test cases, writing implementations in Python and C, and creating formal proofs in Lean. It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves. If anyone has thoughts on how to structure the proofs or improve the testing setup, I would love to hear ideas or feedback. reply",

I want to change that view and show that algorithms are beautiful and useful beyond interviews. They appear everywhere, from compilers to databases to the Linux kernel, where I found many interesting data structures worth exploring. (i will share more about this topic later) I hope to share more of these insights and connect with others who enjoy discussing real world algorithm design, which is what I love most about the Hacker News community (except for the occasional trolls that show up from time to time). reply",

          "text": "Those algorithms implement so random to me, with lack of explanation, no test cases, no formal proof, and often inconsistent naming or structure across languages. Many repositories like TheAlgorithms are great collections, but they feel more like code dumps than true learning resources. You can find an implementation of Dijkstra or QuickSort, but often there is no context: why it works, how to prove it correct, what the complexity is, or how to test it against edge cases. For someone who wants to learn algorithms deeply, that missing layer of reasoning and validation is critical. No organization for learners either. It jumps straight into implementations without a logical flow from fundamentals. I want to build something more structured: start from the very foundation (like data structures, recursion, and complexity analysis), then move to classical algorithms (search, sort, graph, dynamic programming), and eventually extend to database internals, optimization, and even machine learning or AI algorithms. Basically, a single consistent roadmap from beginner to researcher level, where every algorithm connects to the next and builds intuition step by step. Another very good resource for beginners is https://www.hello-algo.com . At first, i actually wanted to contribute there, since it explains algorithms visually and in simple language. But it mostly covers the basics and stops before more advanced or applied topics. I want to go deeper and treat algorithms as both code and theory, with mathematical rigor and formal proofs where possible. That is something I really liked about Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and of course The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) by Knuth. They combine reasoning, math, and practice. My goal is to make something in that spirit, but more practical and modern, bridging the gap between academic books and messy open source repos. reply",

The VM and transpiler were originally implemented by hand, and later I used Codex to help polish the code. The generated output works, though it is a bit messy in places.

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

After Go 1.18, you can do it directly with generics: s := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9}\nslices.Sort(s) Much simpler and expressive, yet still type safe. I really like how Go kept it minimal without adding too many abstractions. reply",

I'm trying to prepare myself for a future where agents are much more autonomous, and I can give them tasks and just have them go run with them. This seems like the path to that, but if anyone has better ideas, I'm all for hearing them. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens.

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

          "text": ">, then you wouldn't put an ad on your site that wasn't valid XHTML, You're overlooking how incentives and motivations work.  The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

It was originally more planned to be a Blackberry competitor, and the early Android handset prototype concepts were all blackberry knockoffs with similar physical keyboard layouts. It has always appeared though like you suggest, that the project quickly pivoted to candy bar touch phones following the release of the original iPhone. It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been trying to articulate why coding feels less pleasant now.<p><i>The problem:</i> You can't win anymore.<p>The old way: You'd think about the problem. Draw some diagrams. Understand what you're actually trying to do. Then write the code. Understanding was mandatory. You solved it.<p>The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise.<p>So I feel pressure to always, always, start by info dumping the problem description to AI and gamble for a one-shot. Voice transcription for 10 minutes, hit send, hope I get something first try, if not hope I can iterate until something works. And when even something does work = zero satisfaction because I don't have the same depth of understanding of the solution. Its no longer my code, my idea. It's just some code I found online. `import solution from chatgpt`<p>If I think about the problem, I feel inefficient. \"Why did you waste 2 hours on that? AI would've done it in 10 minutes.\"<p>If I use AI to help, the work doesn't feel like mine. When I show it to anyone, the implicit response is: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\"<p>The steering and judgment I apply to AI outputs is invisible. Nobody sees which suggestions I rejected, how I refined the prompts, or what decisions I made. So all credit flows to the AI by default.<p><i>The result:</i> Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster.<p>I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time.<p><i>Am I alone in this?</i><p>Does anyone else feel this pressure to skip understanding? Where thinking feels like you're not using the tool correctly? In the old days, I understood every problem I worked on. Now I feel pressure to skip understanding and just ship. I hate it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Not necessarily an identical thought to OP, but, anecdotally (n=1), my experience teaching the exact same course on Advanced Java Programming for the last 4 years has been that the students seem to be getting more and more cynical, and seem to think of programming as an art or as a noteworthy endeavour in itself less and less. Very few people have actually vocalised the \"why do I even need to learn this if I can write a prompt\" sentiment out loud, but it has been voiced, and even from those who don't say it there's a very definite 'vibe' that is all but screaming it. Whereas the vibe in the lecture theatre 4 years ago was far more nerdy and enthusiastic. It makes me feel very sorry for this new generation that they will never get to enjoy the same feeling of satisfaction from solving a hard problem with code you thought and wrote from scratch. Ironically, I've had to incorporate some AI stuff in my course as a result of needing to remain \"current\", which almost feels like it validates that cynical sentiment that this soulless way is the way to be doing things now. reply",

          "text": "That's not my experience. Over christmas I re wrote a restaurant POS application from laravel to vue/wrangler using bolt + chatgpt. My exact steps: 1) I took my db schema and got chatGPT to convert it to typescript types and stub data. 2) Uploaded these types to bolt and asked it one by one to create vue components to display this data(Catalog screen, Payment Dialogs, Tables page etc) and to use fetcher functions that return stub data. 3) Finally I asked it replace stub data with supabase.rpc calls, and create postgres functions to serve this data. While I had most of the app done in a few days, testing, styling and adding bug fixing took a month. Some minor stuff was done manually by me: Receipt printer integration integration because bolt wasn't good at epson xml or related libraries that time. Finally we released early feb and we received extremely good feedback from our customers. However now I'm using claude and even higher percentage of code is generated by it now. Our feature velocity is also great. After launch we have added following features in 6m 1) Split Table Payments\n2) Payment Terminal Integration\n3) Visual Floor plan viewer\n4) Mobile POS for waiters without tablet\n5) Reports, Dashboard, Import/Export\n6) Loyalty programs with many different types of programs\n7) Self-service Webshop with realtime group ordering\n8) Improved tax handling\n9) Multicourse orders(\"La'suite\")\n10) Many other smaller features This would be very hard to achieve without AI for most one-person engineering teams. Although tbf not impossible. > The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. I think here the OP introduces a strawman since as many people have pointed out, the labour saving happens in automating menial tasks and no one sane should give up \"understanding the details\". > >I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts.

          "text": "Reading HN I seem to be in the minority but AI has made programming a lot more fun for me. I've been an engineer for nearly 25 years and 95% of the work is rather mindless boilerplate. I know exactly what I need to do next, it just takes time and iteration. The \"you think about the problem and draw diagrams\" part of you describe probably makes up less than 5% of a typical engineering workflow, depending on what you work on. I work in a scientific field where it's probably more than for someone working in web dev, but even here it's very little, and usually only at the beginning of a project. Afterwards it's all about iteration. And using AI doesn't change that part at all, you still need to design the high level solution for an LLM to produce anything remotely useful. I never encountered the problem of not understanding details of the AI's implementation that people here seem to describe. I still review all the code and need to ask the LLM to make small adjustments if I'm not happy with it, especially around not-so-elegant abstractions. Tasks that I actively avoided previously because they seemed like a hassle, like large refactorings, I no longer avoid now because I can ask an AI to do most of it. I feel so much productive and work is more satisfying because I get to knock out all these chores that I had resistance to before. Brainstorming with an AI about potential solutions to a hard problem is also more fun for me, and more productive, than doing research the old ways. So instead of drawing diagrams I now just have conversations. I can't say for certain whether using LLMs has made me much more productive (overall it likely has but for certain tasks it hasn't), but it definitely has made work more fun for me. Another side effect has been that I'm learning new things more frequently when using AI. When I brainstorm solutions with an AI or ask for an implementation, it sometimes uses libraries and abstractions I have not seen before, especially around very low level code that I'm not super familiar with. Previously I was much more likely to use or do things the one way I know. reply",

About how replaceable we are. The whole aesthetic has a, “good art vs. bad art,” parallel to it.

          "text": "Web Programming has stolen satisfaction from programming. At least for me. I've coded in win32, XWindows, GTK, UIKit, Logo, Smalltalk, QT, and others since 95. I had various (and sometimes serious) issues with any of these as I worked in them. No other mechanism of helping humans interact with computation has been more frustrating and disappointing than the web. Pointing out how silly it all is (really, I have to use 3 separate languages with different computation models, plus countless frameworks, and that's just on the client side???), never makes me popular with people who have invested huge amounts of time and energy into mastering etheral library idioms or modern \"best practices\" which will be different next month. And the documentation? Find someone who did a quick blog on it, trying to get their name out there. Good luck. The fact that an AI is an efficient, but lossy compression of the big pile, to help me churn it faster, it's actually kind of refreshing for me. Any confidence that I was doing the Right Thing in this domain always made me wonder how \"imagined\" it was. That fact that I have a stochastic parrot with sycophantic confidence to help me hallucinate through it all? That just takes it to 11. I thought when James Mickens wrote \"To Wash It All Away\" ( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/towashitalla... ), maybe someday things would get better. 10 years later, the furniture has moved and changed color some, but its still the same shitty experience. reply",

          "text": "I absolutely love it. I find it empowers me more than ever before, and my satisfaction is at all time highs. I'm even building projects now (videogames) that I probably wouldn't have started before. Here's where I'm at: - Your subjective taste will become more important than ever, be it graphic design, code architecture, visual art, music, and so on for each domain that AI becomes good at. People with better taste will produce better results. If you have bad taste, you can't steer _any_ tool (AI or otherwise) into producing good outputs. So refining your taste and expanding it will become more important. re: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\", I see a parallel to Stable Diffusion visual art. Sure, anyone _can_ make _anything_, but getting certain types of artistic outputs is still an exercise in skill and knowledge. Without the right skill expression, they won't have the same outputs. - Delegating the things where \"I don't have time to think about that right now\" feels really good. As an analog, e.g., importing lodash and using one of their functions instead of writing your own. With AI, it's like getting magical bespoke algorithms tailored exactly to your needs (but unlike lodash, I actually see the underlying src!). Treat it like a black box until it stops working for you. I think \"use AI vs not\" is similar to \"use a library or not\": you kinda still have to understand what you need to do before picking up the tool. You don't have to understand any tool perfectly to make effective use out of it. - AI is a tremendous help at getting you over blockers. Previous procrastination is eliminated when you can tell AI to just start building and making forward progress, or if you ask it for a high level overview on how something works to demystify something you previously perceived as insurmountable or tough. > Nothing feels satisfying anymore You still have to realize that were it not for you guiding the process, the thing in question would not exist. e.g., if you vibecode a videogame, you start to realize that there's no way (today) that a model is 1-shotting that. At least, it isn't 1-shotting it exactly to your vision. You and AI compile an artifact together that's greater than the sum of both of you. I find that satisfying and exciting. Eventually you will have to fix it (and so come to understand parts you neglected to earlier). It's incredibly satisfying when AI writes the tedious test cases for things I write personally (including all edge cases) and I just review and verify they are correct. I still find I regret in the long term cases where I vibe-accept the code it produces without much critical thought, because when I need to finesse those, I can see how it sometimes produces a fractal of bad designs/implementations. In a real production app with stakes and consequences you still need to be reading and understanding everything it produces imo. If you don't, it's at your own peril. I do worry about my longterm memory though. I don't think that purely reading and thinking is enough to drill something into your brain in a way that allows you to accurately produce it again later. Probably would screw me over in a job interview without AI access. reply",

There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster. I've had so much satisfaction since ai coding.

There are tons of problems that LLMs can't tackle.

You said \"the only exception here is learning\" - and that exception was my hobby . Programming simple things wasn't work for me. It was entertainment. It was what I did for fun on weekends. Reading a blog post about writing a toy database or a parser combinator library and then spending a Saturday afternoon implementing it myself. that was like going to an amusement park. It was a few hours of enjoyable, bounded exploration. I could follow my curiosity, learn something new, and have fun doing it. And you're right: if an LLM can solve it with the same quality, it's not a problem worthy of human effort. I agree with that logic. I've internalized it from years in the industry, from working with AI, from learning to make decisions about what to spend time on. But here's what's been lost: that logic has closed the amusement park . All those simple, fun learning projects now feel stupid. When I see those blog posts now, my gut reaction is \"why would I waste time on that? That's one prompt away.\" The feeling that it's \"not worthy\" has completely drained the joy out of it. I can't turn off that instinct anymore. I know those 200 lines of code are trivial. I know AI can generate them. And so doing it myself feels like I'm deliberately choosing to be inefficient, like I'm LARPing at being a programmer instead of actually learning something valuable. The problem isn't that I disagree with you. The problem is that I agree with you so completely that I can no longer have fun. The only \"worthy\" problems left are the hard ones AI can't do. But those require months of serious investment, not a casual Saturday afternoon. reply",

          "text": "> The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. That's the \"promise\", but in practice it's exactly what you don't want to do. Models can't think. Logic, accuracy, truth, etc are not things models understand, nor do they understand anything. It's just a happy accident that sometimes their output makes sense to humans based on the statistical correlations derived during training. > The result: Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster. Am I the only one who is not totally impressed by the quality of code LLMs generate? I've used Claude, Copilot, Codex and local options, all with latest models, and I have not been impressed on the greenfield projects I work on. Yes, they're good for rote work, especially writing tests, but if you're doing something novel or off the beaten path, then just lol. > I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time. If you don't understand these things yourself, how do you know the LLM is \"correct\" in what it outputs? I'd venture to say the feeling that models can do it better than you comes from exactly that problem: you don't know enough to have educated opinions and insights into the problem you're addressing with LLMs, and thus can't accurately judge the quality of their solutions. Not that there's anything wrong with not knowing something, and this is not meant to be a swipe at you, your skills or knowledge, nor is my intention to make assumptions about you. It's just that when I use LLMs for non-trivial tasks that I'm intimately familiar with, I am not impressed. The more that I know about a domain, the more nits I can pick with whatever LLMs spew out, but when I don't know the domain, it seems like \"magic\", until I do some further research and find problems. To address the bad feelings: I work with several AI companies, the ones that actually care about quality were very, very adamant about  avoiding AI for development outside of doing augmented searches. They actively filtered out candidates that used AI for resumes and had AI slop code contributions, and do the same with their code base and development process. And it's not about worrying about their IP being siphoned off to LLM providers, but about the code quality in itself and the fact that there is deep value in the human beings working at a company understanding not only the code they write, but how the system works in the micro and macro levels. They're acutely aware of models' limitations and they don't want them touching their code capital. -- I think these tools have value, I use them and reluctantly pay for them, but the idea that they're going to replace development with prompt writing is a pipe dream. You can only get so far with next-token generators. reply",

I ask because I've worked across different domains: V8 bytecode optimizations, HPC at Sandia (differential equations on 50k nodes, adaptive mesh refinement heuristics), resource allocation and admission control for CI systems, custom network UDP network stack for mobile apps https://neumob.com/ . In every case in my memory, the AI coding tools of today would have been useful. You say your work is \"very specific\" and AI is \"too stupid\" for it. This just makes me very curious what does that look like concretely? What programming task exists that can't be decomposed into smaller problems? My experience as an engineer is that I'm already just applying known solutions that researchers figured out. That's the job. Every problem I've encountered in my professional life was solvable - you decompose it, you research up an algorithm (or an approximation), you implement it. Sometimes the textbook says the math is \"graduate-level\" but you just... read it and it's tractable. You linearize, you approximate, you use penalty barrier methods. Not an theoretically optimal solution, but it gets the job done. I don't see a structural difference between \"turning JSON into pretty HTML\" and using OR-tools to schedule workers for a department store. Both are decomposable problems. Both are solvable. The latter just has more domain jargon. So I'm asking: what's the concrete example? What code would you write that's supposedly beyond this? I frequently see this kind of comment in AI threads that there is more sophisticated kinds of AI proof programming out there. Let me try to clarify another way. Are you claiming that say 50% of the total economic activity  is beyond AI? or is some sort of niche role that only contributes 3% to GDP?

          "text": "Do recommend the LG C series (C5 or C4 are new or the C1 series if you want a deal on classifieds - same hardware as the higher end models but needs a firmware bit flip). The OS is very rootable and it makes a great TV that doubles as a monitor. Supports free sync / g-sync. OLED is nice at this scale. Text is very readable, refresh rate is good. It uses the same panels as the fancier G series in the larger sizes. One can root the firmware to make it go brighter. (Though this is screen works well in medium or dimly lit rooms. It does not shine in very bright rooms). Plenty of YouTube videos singing the C series praises as a TV / Monitor.[1] LG webOS is also trivial/friendly to root in developer mode and network control of the tv is a nice to have. Would avoid Samsung. I love the matte on the Frame and the design of the Serif but the OS is frustrating / impractical to root. [1] https://youtu.be/Qtve0u3GJ9Y reply",

My \"favorite\" feature is that when I use an app like Netflix and then press the \"Exit\" button on the remote there's a 50% chance I just land back on my desktop and a 50% chance that the menu that covers the bottom third of the screen is open. It can also frequently not find the signal of the computer, maybe 1 in 50 times. Sometimes it'll connect in a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes after replugging the HDMI, and sometimes updating the screen by doing things like pressing buttons that would cause something to change (my computer neither hybernates nor goes to sleep). Not to mention that it frequently will ask me to update the terms of service (I cannot reject them, I can only select \"remind me later\" and it starts to get aggressive) and it will change some settings when it force updates on me.

          "text": "Another +1 for LG but it's worth mentioning that there are a few things that a TV firmware does that you don't necessarily want in a Monitor. Simple example: most TVs will stay on _forever_ with the \"no signal\" image bouncing around... but a proper monitor will interpret that as a sign that the PC has gone to sleep so the monitor should, too. I have not looked into hacking the firmware to change this behavior but if there's a \"custom rom\" out there that can do this, I'd appreciate a link! One of the best things about LG in general is their serial port.\nIt's hit/miss which of their models will have it exposed on the back, but if yours does,  the protocol is well documented and is very simple. My LG TV (used as a monitor) is really chatty on the network and so I keep it disconnected so I don't get periodic interruptions from little overlays telling me that $someApp has been updated and needs me to agree to new terms (yes, really!). To re-gain remote control for automation, I use the serial port. I have an ESP32 connected to a mmWave sensor for active \"at desk?\" detection. This is integrated with Home Assistant which knows which PC my KVM is pointing to and if it's on or not. This lets me re-implement basic \"if not at desk and no PC is on, put the display to sleep\" automation. My biggest complaint is more of an ecosystem issue; why is DisplayPort not common on TVs? Because this TV-As-A-Monitor is HDMI only, my KVM has to be HDMI and so does every PC that's hooked up. Would have been a lot nicer if the whole chain could be display port :/. reply",

Takes a bit messing around with picture settings (there's some good guides online) but I've never found the \"TV\" parts to get in the way, just connected it via HDMI, put it in PC mode, disable wifi, and it's good to go. I guess I've been using it around 4 years now. The only serious issue is the shininess of the screen.

          "text": "If you were using a TV streaming stick, many have slow Ethernet due to slow port (Micro-USB), slow PHY hardware (100 mbps) or slow network stack. For the popular streaming apps they only need 25 mbps max, so most stick makers put no effort into design or validation testing beyond that minimal use case. And they don't care about latency. I use Moonlight via direct 1 gbps Ethernet from a high-end gaming PC in the same house through a Google Chromecast 4K HDMI dongle with a powered USB-C hub for the RJ-45 input and it works flawlessly at 60 fps 4K 10-bit HDR with around 12 ms video latency. Some USB 3 hubs and USB Ethernet dongles won't reach full speeds on some streaming devices USB ports. The second one I tried worked at full 1 gbps. You have to verify every software and hardware component in the chain is working at high-speed/low latency in your environment with a local speed test hosted on your source machine. I used self-hosted OpenSpeedTest. Moonlight works great but none of the consumer streaming stick or USB hub/RJ-45 dongles test for high speed/low latency across dozens of different device port hardware/firmware combos - so you can't trust claimed specs. Assume it's slow until you verify it's not. reply",

          "text": "This is correct and the general sentiment and experience among professionals. Starting in late 2022, there's been a coordinated assault on industry by AI, both in terms of false marketing (execs thinking they can replace all their workers), and in terms of torturous interference (ghost candidates/ghost jobs) imposing cost on all candidates (and business alike). It has demonstrated a number of important things some which are just bad for industry in the long-run like the resilience built-in to architecture by competent people may have been ill-thought out. People used to automate away the boring stuff, but when that boring stuff doesn't break for 2 years because of design, they can just let you go for that time. They lose out the value of becoming leaner, and coping with emergencies but few people after this are setting up fully resilient architecture. You can't pay enough for the demonstrated downside. There's been a critical loss of credibility on the industry by these actions. I would reiterate and corroborate that LinkedIn and Indeed are worthless for hiring. They do not curate the people they allow to advertise for jobs. There are many fake company spinoffs for non-existent roles that use the personalized CV data for something else. These fake companies lead you on, use AI to eat up your time, and often fail a more thorough background check into public records using OSINT. (i.e. quite a number have owners who were in obituaries with paperwork filed after their deaths). For real data, the average cold-submit of CV to interview ratio has been around 1:1200 for LI/Indeed. These have been custom tailored for the positions, for an individual with a decade of experience as an expert generalist (Linux & Windows Ecosystems both on-prem and Cloud-tenant based), with deep expertise in helpdesk at all SLA tier levels, System/Network Admin roles/Principal Engineer, and DevOps/Architect roles. Unable to find work in two years of massive unrelenting week-by-week effort, a good number of competent techies are now retraining. The brain drain on industry caused by this is massive and shouldn't be overlooked but appears to be. Some might think to say this is just a bad economy. Tech has never been correlated with the driving factors of the economy. Interest rate increases, and financial crises have come and gone in the past with no observable change in tech. This is a disruption-based economy, and its unhinged. This appears to be purely the work of factor market manipulation by oligopoly, to glut the factor market and stall the economy for profit. The same things that happen when you fire your people, raise prises, and lower production which often ends in a vicious doom cycle since lack of money in circulation lowers the amount of customers, which drives more firing in deflationary spirals which are common under regimes of money-printing given sufficient time. reply",

It is extremely smart in applying punctuation and formatting. - You don't need expensive Microphones to get good accuracy. The crappy microphone that comes with your laptop should be good enough. For me Dragon was pretty much unusable without expensive microphone setup. And even then, it needed constant intervention for punctuation and formatting. Here's an example of what I mean. In these tests, I just spoke the words, I did not dictate any punctuation. Mistakes annotated by ~ VoiceBuddy (with microphone built into my cheap Logitech Webcam):\nThe color of animals is by no means a matter of choice. It depends on many considerations, but in the majority of the cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there are to be but few brightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are themselves protective. The kingfisher itself, though so brightly colored, is by no means easy to see. The blue harmonizes with the water and the bird, as it darts along the stream, and looks almost like a flash of sunlight.

          "text": "My second favorite “Wild, Wild, Country”, but it was mentioned already at the top of the first list.  I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",

Exploration & learning: When evaluating a new library or framework, I ask AI for comparisons or best practices. Docs summarization: LLMs help me parse long RFCs or documentation quickly. Prototyping / boilerplate: For scaffolding boring repetitive code. But not for actual algorithmic thinking or critical code — those still rely on human judgment. In short: top engineers do use AI, but they use it like they use Stack Overflow — a tool for leverage, not a crutch. reply",

          "text": "I am a lead software engineer with 12 years of experience and a recent master's degree in cybersecurity. I use GitHub CoPilot everyday. I usually limit it to a fancy auto-complete. It's really helpful for repetitive refactor tasks, I just have to go to each line and it updates. This way I still see what's happening, but it is faster than manually making those changes that can't be solved with a find and replace. Sometimes I fight CoPilot because it will continue to suggest something I do not want to do. In those instances I code faster as to outpace the AI's latency. Other devs are building MCP servers to help access our tools for AI integration. Devops seems heavy on spec driven and test driven development through AI. The spec driven development looks interesting, but a bit of overhead to get started. Our company has an AI first directive right now where we're supposed to use AI for everything and see what works. I somewhat disdain it, but it's also fun to have a directive to try new things indiscriminately (using AI). The more I drink the Kool aid, the better it tastes. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be? reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information.

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

I'm actually already able to test for nearly everything you'd want to check for in a consumable, I'm just keeping the focus of the public website on plastic chemicals for now to avoid feature creep and scope management issues. I have considered creating specific ad-hoc campaign pages for folks with special interests and let them drive people to the page (like a more focused Kickstarter or GoFundMe with a lab on the back end). If anyone has a special interest I'm happy to mock up what funding targets would be. reply",

In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

It not only generates responses it contextualises it and understands from your comments who the key contributors are and how you're being perceived. It can help you identify your promoters (potential customers) and also guide you content that works.

It speeds up community management massively with the advanced filtiration and ML in the backend. What do you guys think? reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place.

These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

Many repositories like TheAlgorithms are great collections, but they feel more like code dumps than true learning resources. You can find an implementation of Dijkstra or QuickSort, but often there is no context: why it works, how to prove it correct, what the complexity is, or how to test it against edge cases. For someone who wants to learn algorithms deeply, that missing layer of reasoning and validation is critical. No organization for learners either. It jumps straight into implementations without a logical flow from fundamentals. I want to build something more structured: start from the very foundation (like data structures, recursion, and complexity analysis), then move to classical algorithms (search, sort, graph, dynamic programming), and eventually extend to database internals, optimization, and even machine learning or AI algorithms. Basically, a single consistent roadmap from beginner to researcher level, where every algorithm connects to the next and builds intuition step by step. Another very good resource for beginners is https://www.hello-algo.com . At first, i actually wanted to contribute there, since it explains algorithms visually and in simple language. But it mostly covers the basics and stops before more advanced or applied topics. I want to go deeper and treat algorithms as both code and theory, with mathematical rigor and formal proofs where possible. That is something I really liked about Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and of course The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) by Knuth. They combine reasoning, math, and practice. My goal is to make something in that spirit, but more practical and modern, bridging the gap between academic books and messy open source repos. reply",

Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue.

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Even Microsoft's own security teams publish blog posts enthusiastically explaining how they found this strange ancient tech from some Windows archaeological dig site, lol.

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile.

The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens.

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

Because non-engineers are writing HTML. It’s like putting the tires on before the brakes, but brakes after, and expecting it to work. However because you can be both bold and italic, these should just be flags and that’s how they are now which is why b or i can be closed before b or i. I doubt they are just flags in the code of the browsers though because tags support styles and stuff. reply",

Do you try to maintain any of the HTML semantics or just render plain text? If it’s plain text, that’s useless. If you’re rendering anything with any semantics, then you need to know how to parse it. You’re back where you started. Granted, I could ensure that my code was valid XHTML, but I’m a hypermeticulous autistic weirdo, and most other people aren’t.

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

One of the joys of learning HTML when it tended to be hand-written was that if you made a mistake, you'd still see something just with distorted output. That was a lot more approachable for a lot of people who were put off \"real\" programming languages because they were overwhelmed by terrible error messages any time they missed a bracket or misspelled something. If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages. The kind of thing where you could miss a bracket on line 47 but end up with a compiler error complaining about something 20 lines away. Rust ( in particular ) got everyone to bring up their game with respect to meaningful compiler errors. But in the days of XHTML?

Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

They can manage it with JSX, they can manage it with JSON, they can manage it with JavaScript, they can manage it with every back-end language like Python, PHP, Ruby, etc. The idea that people see XHTML being parsed strictly and give up has never had any truth to it. reply",

Also, the only thing specific to Next that survived in MacOSX and iOS was ObjectiveC and the whole NextStep APIs, which honestly I don't think it a great thing.

The OS is very rootable and it makes a great TV that doubles as a monitor. Supports free sync / g-sync. OLED is nice at this scale. Text is very readable, refresh rate is good. It uses the same panels as the fancier G series in the larger sizes. One can root the firmware to make it go brighter. (Though this is screen works well in medium or dimly lit rooms. It does not shine in very bright rooms). Plenty of YouTube videos singing the C series praises as a TV / Monitor.[1] LG webOS is also trivial/friendly to root in developer mode and network control of the tv is a nice to have. Would avoid Samsung. I love the matte on the Frame and the design of the Serif but the OS is frustrating / impractical to root. [1] https://youtu.be/Qtve0u3GJ9Y reply",

My \"favorite\" feature is that when I use an app like Netflix and then press the \"Exit\" button on the remote there's a 50% chance I just land back on my desktop and a 50% chance that the menu that covers the bottom third of the screen is open. It can also frequently not find the signal of the computer, maybe 1 in 50 times. Sometimes it'll connect in a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes after replugging the HDMI, and sometimes updating the screen by doing things like pressing buttons that would cause something to change (my computer neither hybernates nor goes to sleep). Not to mention that it frequently will ask me to update the terms of service (I cannot reject them, I can only select \"remind me later\" and it starts to get aggressive) and it will change some settings when it force updates on me.

          "text": "Another +1 for LG but it's worth mentioning that there are a few things that a TV firmware does that you don't necessarily want in a Monitor. Simple example: most TVs will stay on _forever_ with the \"no signal\" image bouncing around... but a proper monitor will interpret that as a sign that the PC has gone to sleep so the monitor should, too. I have not looked into hacking the firmware to change this behavior but if there's a \"custom rom\" out there that can do this, I'd appreciate a link! One of the best things about LG in general is their serial port.\nIt's hit/miss which of their models will have it exposed on the back, but if yours does,  the protocol is well documented and is very simple. My LG TV (used as a monitor) is really chatty on the network and so I keep it disconnected so I don't get periodic interruptions from little overlays telling me that $someApp has been updated and needs me to agree to new terms (yes, really!). To re-gain remote control for automation, I use the serial port. I have an ESP32 connected to a mmWave sensor for active \"at desk?\" detection. This is integrated with Home Assistant which knows which PC my KVM is pointing to and if it's on or not. This lets me re-implement basic \"if not at desk and no PC is on, put the display to sleep\" automation. My biggest complaint is more of an ecosystem issue; why is DisplayPort not common on TVs? Because this TV-As-A-Monitor is HDMI only, my KVM has to be HDMI and so does every PC that's hooked up. Would have been a lot nicer if the whole chain could be display port :/. reply",

It’s great because I was getting infuriated by accidentally starting streaming apps that I never use and the cell phone apps as a remote alternative are utter trash from a usability standpoint. I just can’t understand why there is a need for a remote app to do anything besides start to a tv remote. Well, I can, the poison apple of advertising as an additional revenue stream, but it’s still infuriating. I have an older Roku TV and that app has progressively gotten worse. it used to just be ideal, start, auto connect to the last connected tv, and immediately go to the remote. Now it’s a bunch of promotional content by default and you have to tab over to the remote. LGs is far more obnoxious and difficult to navigate. Absolutely inexcusable for displays that can cost $2500+ reply",

I haven't done anything with the TV itself, but I forked an old library ( https://github.com/iguessthislldo/libLGTV_serial ) to control it remotely through serial and Home Assistant without connecting it to my WiFi. I originally set this up for a much older 1080p LG TV, and was able to use it with a newer one with a few modifications. edit: Apparently I specially have C3PUA according to the model data I added. Also if anyone is interested in this, I can update the README because I didn't change it after I forked it. reply",

          "text": "If you were using a TV streaming stick, many have slow Ethernet due to slow port (Micro-USB), slow PHY hardware (100 mbps) or slow network stack. For the popular streaming apps they only need 25 mbps max, so most stick makers put no effort into design or validation testing beyond that minimal use case. And they don't care about latency. I use Moonlight via direct 1 gbps Ethernet from a high-end gaming PC in the same house through a Google Chromecast 4K HDMI dongle with a powered USB-C hub for the RJ-45 input and it works flawlessly at 60 fps 4K 10-bit HDR with around 12 ms video latency. Some USB 3 hubs and USB Ethernet dongles won't reach full speeds on some streaming devices USB ports. The second one I tried worked at full 1 gbps. You have to verify every software and hardware component in the chain is working at high-speed/low latency in your environment with a local speed test hosted on your source machine. I used self-hosted OpenSpeedTest. Moonlight works great but none of the consumer streaming stick or USB hub/RJ-45 dongles test for high speed/low latency across dozens of different device port hardware/firmware combos - so you can't trust claimed specs. Assume it's slow until you verify it's not. reply",

          "text": "I've been unhappy with project management tools for over a decade now. There's nothing for personal project management and context switching. Workflowy is cool, but it doesn't fit my workflow. It's also not profitable. Asana was great, but they started targeting teams. A lot of these tools are heavily team focused; the experience is heavily geared there. I end up using a Sublime Text plugin for personal things. Most of these tools have a terrible mobile experience, and it's still the same a decade later. The other problem is that most tools are overly flexible. Jira is customizable but it's just terrible user experience. Linear is like Jira with the 80% main features and people use it just because it's a smoother Jira. Basecamp, Trello, Todoist, Pivotal Tracker are heavily opinionated and don't try to do what they're not meant to do. But they're not my workflow either. So vibe coding a project management tool at this point makes more sense for me than trying to config Jira for personal use. Specifically, there's things like priority. I think priority matters a lot, but there's no difference between Item A of medium-high priority and Item B of medium-high priority. I like having an \"I'm feeling lucky button\" to just pick an item of high priority instead of having to think. My bug list are the following priority levels: emergency, requested, very important, important, fix if time, probably don't fix, can't repro/don't fix. I think it was retrofitted from FogBugz: https://webapps-support.ccts.uic.edu/help/topics/schedules/P... Well, it's also too much work to set up FogBugz or even customize Jira to this, nor do I want to pay for either. I've already built all the above. It's all set up in Flutter, meaning it runs on mac, windows, web, ios, android just fine. A few more days of work and I can then sync it to my phone. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been trying to articulate why coding feels less pleasant now.<p><i>The problem:</i> You can't win anymore.<p>The old way: You'd think about the problem. Draw some diagrams. Understand what you're actually trying to do. Then write the code. Understanding was mandatory. You solved it.<p>The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise.<p>So I feel pressure to always, always, start by info dumping the problem description to AI and gamble for a one-shot. Voice transcription for 10 minutes, hit send, hope I get something first try, if not hope I can iterate until something works. And when even something does work = zero satisfaction because I don't have the same depth of understanding of the solution. Its no longer my code, my idea. It's just some code I found online. `import solution from chatgpt`<p>If I think about the problem, I feel inefficient. \"Why did you waste 2 hours on that? AI would've done it in 10 minutes.\"<p>If I use AI to help, the work doesn't feel like mine. When I show it to anyone, the implicit response is: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\"<p>The steering and judgment I apply to AI outputs is invisible. Nobody sees which suggestions I rejected, how I refined the prompts, or what decisions I made. So all credit flows to the AI by default.<p><i>The result:</i> Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster.<p>I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time.<p><i>Am I alone in this?</i><p>Does anyone else feel this pressure to skip understanding? Where thinking feels like you're not using the tool correctly? In the old days, I understood every problem I worked on. Now I feel pressure to skip understanding and just ship. I hate it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Very few people have actually vocalised the \"why do I even need to learn this if I can write a prompt\" sentiment out loud, but it has been voiced, and even from those who don't say it there's a very definite 'vibe' that is all but screaming it. Whereas the vibe in the lecture theatre 4 years ago was far more nerdy and enthusiastic. It makes me feel very sorry for this new generation that they will never get to enjoy the same feeling of satisfaction from solving a hard problem with code you thought and wrote from scratch. Ironically, I've had to incorporate some AI stuff in my course as a result of needing to remain \"current\", which almost feels like it validates that cynical sentiment that this soulless way is the way to be doing things now. reply",

          "text": "That's not my experience. Over christmas I re wrote a restaurant POS application from laravel to vue/wrangler using bolt + chatgpt. My exact steps: 1) I took my db schema and got chatGPT to convert it to typescript types and stub data. 2) Uploaded these types to bolt and asked it one by one to create vue components to display this data(Catalog screen, Payment Dialogs, Tables page etc) and to use fetcher functions that return stub data. 3) Finally I asked it replace stub data with supabase.rpc calls, and create postgres functions to serve this data. While I had most of the app done in a few days, testing, styling and adding bug fixing took a month. Some minor stuff was done manually by me: Receipt printer integration integration because bolt wasn't good at epson xml or related libraries that time. Finally we released early feb and we received extremely good feedback from our customers. However now I'm using claude and even higher percentage of code is generated by it now. Our feature velocity is also great. After launch we have added following features in 6m 1) Split Table Payments\n2) Payment Terminal Integration\n3) Visual Floor plan viewer\n4) Mobile POS for waiters without tablet\n5) Reports, Dashboard, Import/Export\n6) Loyalty programs with many different types of programs\n7) Self-service Webshop with realtime group ordering\n8) Improved tax handling\n9) Multicourse orders(\"La'suite\")\n10) Many other smaller features This would be very hard to achieve without AI for most one-person engineering teams. Although tbf not impossible. > The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. I think here the OP introduces a strawman since as many people have pointed out, the labour saving happens in automating menial tasks and no one sane should give up \"understanding the details\". > >I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts.

          "text": "Reading HN I seem to be in the minority but AI has made programming a lot more fun for me. I've been an engineer for nearly 25 years and 95% of the work is rather mindless boilerplate. I know exactly what I need to do next, it just takes time and iteration. The \"you think about the problem and draw diagrams\" part of you describe probably makes up less than 5% of a typical engineering workflow, depending on what you work on. I work in a scientific field where it's probably more than for someone working in web dev, but even here it's very little, and usually only at the beginning of a project. Afterwards it's all about iteration. And using AI doesn't change that part at all, you still need to design the high level solution for an LLM to produce anything remotely useful. I never encountered the problem of not understanding details of the AI's implementation that people here seem to describe. I still review all the code and need to ask the LLM to make small adjustments if I'm not happy with it, especially around not-so-elegant abstractions. Tasks that I actively avoided previously because they seemed like a hassle, like large refactorings, I no longer avoid now because I can ask an AI to do most of it. I feel so much productive and work is more satisfying because I get to knock out all these chores that I had resistance to before. Brainstorming with an AI about potential solutions to a hard problem is also more fun for me, and more productive, than doing research the old ways. So instead of drawing diagrams I now just have conversations. I can't say for certain whether using LLMs has made me much more productive (overall it likely has but for certain tasks it hasn't), but it definitely has made work more fun for me. Another side effect has been that I'm learning new things more frequently when using AI. When I brainstorm solutions with an AI or ask for an implementation, it sometimes uses libraries and abstractions I have not seen before, especially around very low level code that I'm not super familiar with. Previously I was much more likely to use or do things the one way I know. reply",

I used to work in land surveying, entering that field around the turn of the millennium just as digitalisation was hitting the industry in a big way. A common feeling among existing journeymen was one of confusion. Fear and dislike of these threatening changes, which seemed to neutralise all the hard-won professional skills. Expertise with the old equipment. Understanding of how to do things closer to first-principles. Ability to draw plans by hand. To assemble the datasets in the complex and particular old ways. And of course, to mentor juniors in the same. Suddenly, some juniors coming in were young computer whizzes. Speeding past their seniors in these new ways. But still only juniors, for all that - still green, no matter what the tech. With years and decades yet, to earn their stripes, their professionalism in all it's myriad aspects. And for the seniors, their human aptitudes (which got them there in the first place) didn't vanish. They absorbed the changes, stuck with their smart peers, and evolved to match the environment. Would they have rathered that everything in the world had stayed the same as before? Of course. But is that a valid choice, professionally speaking? or in life itself? Not really. reply",

Ok, you don't like a particular way of working or a particular tool. In any other era, we would just stop doing using that tool or method. Who is saying you cannot? Is a real constraint or a perceived one? Regardless, I understand the need to understand what you built. So you have a few options. You can study it (with the agent's help?), you can write your own tests / extensions for it to make sure you really get it, or you can write it yourself. I honestly think that most of those take about as long. It's only shorter when you don't want to understand it, so then we're back to the main question: Why not? reply",

If I have a specific, crappy API that I have to deal with, I'll ask AI to generate the specific functionality I want with it (no more than a method or two).  When it comes to testing, I'll write a few tests (some simple, some complicated) and then ask AI to generate a set of tests based on those examples.  I then run and audit the tests to make sure they are sensible.  I always end my prompts with \"use the simplest, minimal code possible\" I am mostly keeping the joy of programming while still being more productive in areas I'm not great at (exhaustive testing, having patience with crappy APIs) Not world changing, but it has increased my productivity I think. reply",

I had various (and sometimes serious) issues with any of these as I worked in them. No other mechanism of helping humans interact with computation has been more frustrating and disappointing than the web. Pointing out how silly it all is (really, I have to use 3 separate languages with different computation models, plus countless frameworks, and that's just on the client side???), never makes me popular with people who have invested huge amounts of time and energy into mastering etheral library idioms or modern \"best practices\" which will be different next month. And the documentation? Find someone who did a quick blog on it, trying to get their name out there. Good luck. The fact that an AI is an efficient, but lossy compression of the big pile, to help me churn it faster, it's actually kind of refreshing for me. Any confidence that I was doing the Right Thing in this domain always made me wonder how \"imagined\" it was. That fact that I have a stochastic parrot with sycophantic confidence to help me hallucinate through it all? That just takes it to 11. I thought when James Mickens wrote \"To Wash It All Away\" ( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/towashitalla... ), maybe someday things would get better. 10 years later, the furniture has moved and changed color some, but its still the same shitty experience. reply",

          "text": "I absolutely love it. I find it empowers me more than ever before, and my satisfaction is at all time highs. I'm even building projects now (videogames) that I probably wouldn't have started before. Here's where I'm at: - Your subjective taste will become more important than ever, be it graphic design, code architecture, visual art, music, and so on for each domain that AI becomes good at. People with better taste will produce better results. If you have bad taste, you can't steer _any_ tool (AI or otherwise) into producing good outputs. So refining your taste and expanding it will become more important. re: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\", I see a parallel to Stable Diffusion visual art. Sure, anyone _can_ make _anything_, but getting certain types of artistic outputs is still an exercise in skill and knowledge. Without the right skill expression, they won't have the same outputs. - Delegating the things where \"I don't have time to think about that right now\" feels really good. As an analog, e.g., importing lodash and using one of their functions instead of writing your own. With AI, it's like getting magical bespoke algorithms tailored exactly to your needs (but unlike lodash, I actually see the underlying src!). Treat it like a black box until it stops working for you. I think \"use AI vs not\" is similar to \"use a library or not\": you kinda still have to understand what you need to do before picking up the tool. You don't have to understand any tool perfectly to make effective use out of it. - AI is a tremendous help at getting you over blockers. Previous procrastination is eliminated when you can tell AI to just start building and making forward progress, or if you ask it for a high level overview on how something works to demystify something you previously perceived as insurmountable or tough. > Nothing feels satisfying anymore You still have to realize that were it not for you guiding the process, the thing in question would not exist. e.g., if you vibecode a videogame, you start to realize that there's no way (today) that a model is 1-shotting that. At least, it isn't 1-shotting it exactly to your vision. You and AI compile an artifact together that's greater than the sum of both of you. I find that satisfying and exciting. Eventually you will have to fix it (and so come to understand parts you neglected to earlier). It's incredibly satisfying when AI writes the tedious test cases for things I write personally (including all edge cases) and I just review and verify they are correct. I still find I regret in the long term cases where I vibe-accept the code it produces without much critical thought, because when I need to finesse those, I can see how it sometimes produces a fractal of bad designs/implementations. In a real production app with stakes and consequences you still need to be reading and understanding everything it produces imo. If you don't, it's at your own peril. I do worry about my longterm memory though. I don't think that purely reading and thinking is enough to drill something into your brain in a way that allows you to accurately produce it again later. Probably would screw me over in a job interview without AI access. reply",

You said \"the only exception here is learning\" - and that exception was my hobby . Programming simple things wasn't work for me. It was entertainment. It was what I did for fun on weekends. Reading a blog post about writing a toy database or a parser combinator library and then spending a Saturday afternoon implementing it myself. that was like going to an amusement park. It was a few hours of enjoyable, bounded exploration. I could follow my curiosity, learn something new, and have fun doing it. And you're right: if an LLM can solve it with the same quality, it's not a problem worthy of human effort. I agree with that logic. I've internalized it from years in the industry, from working with AI, from learning to make decisions about what to spend time on. But here's what's been lost: that logic has closed the amusement park . All those simple, fun learning projects now feel stupid. When I see those blog posts now, my gut reaction is \"why would I waste time on that? That's one prompt away.\" The feeling that it's \"not worthy\" has completely drained the joy out of it. I can't turn off that instinct anymore. I know those 200 lines of code are trivial. I know AI can generate them. And so doing it myself feels like I'm deliberately choosing to be inefficient, like I'm LARPing at being a programmer instead of actually learning something valuable. The problem isn't that I disagree with you. The problem is that I agree with you so completely that I can no longer have fun. The only \"worthy\" problems left are the hard ones AI can't do.

          "text": "> The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. That's the \"promise\", but in practice it's exactly what you don't want to do. Models can't think. Logic, accuracy, truth, etc are not things models understand, nor do they understand anything. It's just a happy accident that sometimes their output makes sense to humans based on the statistical correlations derived during training. > The result: Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster. Am I the only one who is not totally impressed by the quality of code LLMs generate? I've used Claude, Copilot, Codex and local options, all with latest models, and I have not been impressed on the greenfield projects I work on. Yes, they're good for rote work, especially writing tests, but if you're doing something novel or off the beaten path, then just lol. > I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time. If you don't understand these things yourself, how do you know the LLM is \"correct\" in what it outputs? I'd venture to say the feeling that models can do it better than you comes from exactly that problem: you don't know enough to have educated opinions and insights into the problem you're addressing with LLMs, and thus can't accurately judge the quality of their solutions. Not that there's anything wrong with not knowing something, and this is not meant to be a swipe at you, your skills or knowledge, nor is my intention to make assumptions about you. It's just that when I use LLMs for non-trivial tasks that I'm intimately familiar with, I am not impressed. The more that I know about a domain, the more nits I can pick with whatever LLMs spew out, but when I don't know the domain, it seems like \"magic\", until I do some further research and find problems. To address the bad feelings: I work with several AI companies, the ones that actually care about quality were very, very adamant about  avoiding AI for development outside of doing augmented searches. They actively filtered out candidates that used AI for resumes and had AI slop code contributions, and do the same with their code base and development process. And it's not about worrying about their IP being siphoned off to LLM providers, but about the code quality in itself and the fact that there is deep value in the human beings working at a company understanding not only the code they write, but how the system works in the micro and macro levels. They're acutely aware of models' limitations and they don't want them touching their code capital. -- I think these tools have value, I use them and reluctantly pay for them, but the idea that they're going to replace development with prompt writing is a pipe dream. You can only get so far with next-token generators. reply",

For me Dragon was pretty much unusable without expensive microphone setup. And even then, it needed constant intervention for punctuation and formatting. Here's an example of what I mean. In these tests, I just spoke the words, I did not dictate any punctuation.

It depends on many considerations, but in the majority of the cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there are to be but few brightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are themselves protective. The kingfisher itself, though so brightly colored, is by no means easy to see.

So I'm wondering why can't we have a project that starts from scratch and build the electronics and the OS? In the same spirit of what Apple did with iPhone+iOS. I'm sorry if I sound naive, I just don't realize how hard it is to design a smartphone.<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45586339</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I just did a brief frontend job for a smart-top device, so take this with a grain of salt, but basically when you're planning to release a cheap mobile phone (It was very common until a few years ago to find weird in-house phone brands in European supermarkets) you mainly license a SoC and some sort of development platform from a foundry and that's it. Most drivers, radio devices, kernel, android releases are those you get at the beginning, you can't really change a thing due to them being closed source or just one step above from being a firmware blob with a few kernel hooks and once your contract expires your devices die with it. We investigated if we could at least maintain the software on our own (so to not tell some telco clients their streaming devices were gonna die after 4 years) but it was a big fat no from the licensees. And reverse engineering what we already had was forbidden by contract. In other words, if you want yo build a free phone, you need to build a free radio, a free storage solution, thousands of weird DACs, graphic cards, screen controllers, sensors and whatnot. Making sure you're not infringing on some patents. It's like starting from ground-up. And it's expensive . A possible solution would be to invest into building into a raspberry-pi binary compatible base platform (and take advantage of their already open sourced drivers), but it was 100% economically unfeasible for a 100-200€ device. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5.

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

          "text": "I think this concept has legs to be much bigger than just foods. There are lots of influencer types who focus on testing. For example, there are two individuals who own the same $100k machine for testing the performance of loudspeakers. https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/ Both of them do measurements and YouTube videos. Neither one has a particularly good index of their completed reviews, let alone tools to compare the data. I wish I could subscribe to support a domain like “loud speaker spin tests” and then have my donation paid out to these reviewers based on them publishing new high quality reviews with good data that is published to a common store. reply",

And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

          "text": "For an individual acting on their own, single tests for phthalates and BPA/BPS/BPF normally cost ~$500. Laboratory.love tests three samples from different lots to ensure reliability (as PlasticList found variation of up to 59% between lots of identical products). Thanks to volume pricing and operational efficiency, we're able to target $425 per sample ($1,275 for triplicate testing). This covers not just the chemical analysis but also product acquisition, shipping, and operational costs. Right now there is only about 10% margin left as breathing room. My partner lab specifically offers 300+ unique tests across the following categories: Contaminants, Elemental, Allergen, Preservatives and Additives, Microbial, and Phytochemical, Vitamin, and Actives\" So yes, expansion is definitely possible! If a billionaire wanted to fund a project like this it could certainly convert dollars into data, it's just a matter of choosing which products and contaminants to start chewing through first to ensure the data creates positive change in the real world. reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

I was a bit reluctant to offer most of them for fear they might sound like an attack, especially the things that would involve large changes to what you've already written. Golang, like Python and JS, is garbage-collected; in some cases this is helpful for focusing attention on the central semantics of the algorithms, but it does have the disadvantage that it makes reasoning about space behavior and runtime performance much more difficult.  One of Quicksort's chief benefits, for example, is that it's in-place, which the Python version in your \"cheat sheet\" isn't. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT.

          "text": ">- XHTML. [...] Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly? XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages.

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

It was originally more planned to be a Blackberry competitor, and the early Android handset prototype concepts were all blackberry knockoffs with similar physical keyboard layouts. It has always appeared though like you suggest, that the project quickly pivoted to candy bar touch phones following the release of the original iPhone. It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

The crew goes out to look at a possible gas leak, a loud plane is heard, the camera pans up, and the North Tower is hit. It was one of three recordings of that hit and the only clear one. The rest of the documentary follows the crew into the towers. No one knows what's going on, the scenes are chaotic but also calm as the firefighters try to figure out what to do. Then the second tower falls while (one of the brothers) is in the first. One of the most incredible things I've ever seen. I think it was well known when it came out, but it's been overshadowed especially since searching \"9/11 documentary\" gives a million results. If you want to see one of the craziest human experiences unfold in front of you, there's no other film like this. reply",

I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been trying to articulate why coding feels less pleasant now.<p><i>The problem:</i> You can't win anymore.<p>The old way: You'd think about the problem. Draw some diagrams. Understand what you're actually trying to do. Then write the code. Understanding was mandatory. You solved it.<p>The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise.<p>So I feel pressure to always, always, start by info dumping the problem description to AI and gamble for a one-shot. Voice transcription for 10 minutes, hit send, hope I get something first try, if not hope I can iterate until something works. And when even something does work = zero satisfaction because I don't have the same depth of understanding of the solution. Its no longer my code, my idea. It's just some code I found online. `import solution from chatgpt`<p>If I think about the problem, I feel inefficient. \"Why did you waste 2 hours on that? AI would've done it in 10 minutes.\"<p>If I use AI to help, the work doesn't feel like mine. When I show it to anyone, the implicit response is: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\"<p>The steering and judgment I apply to AI outputs is invisible. Nobody sees which suggestions I rejected, how I refined the prompts, or what decisions I made. So all credit flows to the AI by default.<p><i>The result:</i> Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster.<p>I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time.<p><i>Am I alone in this?</i><p>Does anyone else feel this pressure to skip understanding? Where thinking feels like you're not using the tool correctly? In the old days, I understood every problem I worked on. Now I feel pressure to skip understanding and just ship. I hate it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Very few people have actually vocalised the \"why do I even need to learn this if I can write a prompt\" sentiment out loud, but it has been voiced, and even from those who don't say it there's a very definite 'vibe' that is all but screaming it. Whereas the vibe in the lecture theatre 4 years ago was far more nerdy and enthusiastic. It makes me feel very sorry for this new generation that they will never get to enjoy the same feeling of satisfaction from solving a hard problem with code you thought and wrote from scratch. Ironically, I've had to incorporate some AI stuff in my course as a result of needing to remain \"current\", which almost feels like it validates that cynical sentiment that this soulless way is the way to be doing things now. reply",

But honestly I do not miss it at all. The further AI coding advances, the easier it becomes to build and iterate over small products (even if they just start out as MVPs). And the more I actually feel in my element. I understand why people dislike it, but it feels as if these tools where specifically made for me; and I am getting more and more exited while these keep getting better.

          "text": "That's not my experience. Over christmas I re wrote a restaurant POS application from laravel to vue/wrangler using bolt + chatgpt. My exact steps: 1) I took my db schema and got chatGPT to convert it to typescript types and stub data. 2) Uploaded these types to bolt and asked it one by one to create vue components to display this data(Catalog screen, Payment Dialogs, Tables page etc) and to use fetcher functions that return stub data. 3) Finally I asked it replace stub data with supabase.rpc calls, and create postgres functions to serve this data. While I had most of the app done in a few days, testing, styling and adding bug fixing took a month. Some minor stuff was done manually by me: Receipt printer integration integration because bolt wasn't good at epson xml or related libraries that time. Finally we released early feb and we received extremely good feedback from our customers. However now I'm using claude and even higher percentage of code is generated by it now. Our feature velocity is also great. After launch we have added following features in 6m 1) Split Table Payments\n2) Payment Terminal Integration\n3) Visual Floor plan viewer\n4) Mobile POS for waiters without tablet\n5) Reports, Dashboard, Import/Export\n6) Loyalty programs with many different types of programs\n7) Self-service Webshop with realtime group ordering\n8) Improved tax handling\n9) Multicourse orders(\"La'suite\")\n10) Many other smaller features This would be very hard to achieve without AI for most one-person engineering teams. Although tbf not impossible. > The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. I think here the OP introduces a strawman since as many people have pointed out, the labour saving happens in automating menial tasks and no one sane should give up \"understanding the details\". > >I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. On the contrary. Reading ToyDB[1] source code helped me understand MVCC and Isolation levels.

My innovations live on top of theirs. I don't know if I'd have attained that same feeling starting with AI, but I know AI hasn't replaced the need for good architecture or novel algorithms yet. And it's still bad at breaking down and testing implementations. I use it for all it's good at and try to stay away from what it's not.

          "text": "Reading HN I seem to be in the minority but AI has made programming a lot more fun for me. I've been an engineer for nearly 25 years and 95% of the work is rather mindless boilerplate. I know exactly what I need to do next, it just takes time and iteration. The \"you think about the problem and draw diagrams\" part of you describe probably makes up less than 5% of a typical engineering workflow, depending on what you work on. I work in a scientific field where it's probably more than for someone working in web dev, but even here it's very little, and usually only at the beginning of a project. Afterwards it's all about iteration. And using AI doesn't change that part at all, you still need to design the high level solution for an LLM to produce anything remotely useful. I never encountered the problem of not understanding details of the AI's implementation that people here seem to describe. I still review all the code and need to ask the LLM to make small adjustments if I'm not happy with it, especially around not-so-elegant abstractions. Tasks that I actively avoided previously because they seemed like a hassle, like large refactorings, I no longer avoid now because I can ask an AI to do most of it. I feel so much productive and work is more satisfying because I get to knock out all these chores that I had resistance to before. Brainstorming with an AI about potential solutions to a hard problem is also more fun for me, and more productive, than doing research the old ways. So instead of drawing diagrams I now just have conversations. I can't say for certain whether using LLMs has made me much more productive (overall it likely has but for certain tasks it hasn't), but it definitely has made work more fun for me. Another side effect has been that I'm learning new things more frequently when using AI. When I brainstorm solutions with an AI or ask for an implementation, it sometimes uses libraries and abstractions I have not seen before, especially around very low level code that I'm not super familiar with. Previously I was much more likely to use or do things the one way I know. reply",

I think for coding tasks you can almost interchangeably use AI and outsourcing and preserve the meaning. reply",

          "text": "Not to suggest that analogies solve anything, but perhaps it adds large-scale context to mention that throughout history various (and frequent!) events of technological disruption have had similar effect upon particular fields of work. I used to work in land surveying, entering that field around the turn of the millennium just as digitalisation was hitting the industry in a big way. A common feeling among existing journeymen was one of confusion. Fear and dislike of these threatening changes, which seemed to neutralise all the hard-won professional skills. Expertise with the old equipment. Understanding of how to do things closer to first-principles. Ability to draw plans by hand. To assemble the datasets in the complex and particular old ways. And of course, to mentor juniors in the same. Suddenly, some juniors coming in were young computer whizzes. Speeding past their seniors in these new ways. But still only juniors, for all that - still green, no matter what the tech. With years and decades yet, to earn their stripes, their professionalism in all it's myriad aspects. And for the seniors, their human aptitudes (which got them there in the first place) didn't vanish. They absorbed the changes, stuck with their smart peers, and evolved to match the environment. Would they have rathered that everything in the world had stayed the same as before? Of course. But is that a valid choice, professionally speaking? or in life itself? Not really. reply",

Ok, you don't like a particular way of working or a particular tool. In any other era, we would just stop doing using that tool or method. Who is saying you cannot? Is a real constraint or a perceived one? Regardless, I understand the need to understand what you built. So you have a few options. You can study it (with the agent's help?), you can write your own tests / extensions for it to make sure you really get it, or you can write it yourself. I honestly think that most of those take about as long. It's only shorter when you don't want to understand it, so then we're back to the main question: Why not? reply",

          "text": "I actually agree with everything you said, and I see I failed to communicate my idea that's exactly why I'm so upset. You said \"the only exception here is learning\" - and that exception was my hobby . Programming simple things wasn't work for me. It was entertainment. It was what I did for fun on weekends. Reading a blog post about writing a toy database or a parser combinator library and then spending a Saturday afternoon implementing it myself. that was like going to an amusement park. It was a few hours of enjoyable, bounded exploration. I could follow my curiosity, learn something new, and have fun doing it. And you're right: if an LLM can solve it with the same quality, it's not a problem worthy of human effort. I agree with that logic. I've internalized it from years in the industry, from working with AI, from learning to make decisions about what to spend time on. But here's what's been lost: that logic has closed the amusement park . All those simple, fun learning projects now feel stupid. When I see those blog posts now, my gut reaction is \"why would I waste time on that? That's one prompt away.\" The feeling that it's \"not worthy\" has completely drained the joy out of it. I can't turn off that instinct anymore. I know those 200 lines of code are trivial. I know AI can generate them. And so doing it myself feels like I'm deliberately choosing to be inefficient, like I'm LARPing at being a programmer instead of actually learning something valuable. The problem isn't that I disagree with you. The problem is that I agree with you so completely that I can no longer have fun. The only \"worthy\" problems left are the hard ones AI can't do. But those require months of serious investment, not a casual Saturday afternoon. reply",

So I have to break it down into several sessions giving only partial details (divide and conquer) otherwise will confabulate stupid code.

The grand thinking and the whole picture of the projects is still mine, and I keep trying to give it to \"AI\" from time to time, except each time it spits BS. Also it helps that as a freelancer my stuff gets used by my client directly in production (no manager above, that has a group leader, that has a CEO, that has client's IT department, that finally has the client as final user).

I ask because I've worked across different domains: V8 bytecode optimizations, HPC at Sandia (differential equations on 50k nodes, adaptive mesh refinement heuristics), resource allocation and admission control for CI systems, custom network UDP network stack for mobile apps https://neumob.com/ . In every case in my memory, the AI coding tools of today would have been useful. You say your work is \"very specific\" and AI is \"too stupid\" for it. This just makes me very curious what does that look like concretely? What programming task exists that can't be decomposed into smaller problems? My experience as an engineer is that I'm already just applying known solutions that researchers figured out. That's the job. Every problem I've encountered in my professional life was solvable - you decompose it, you research up an algorithm (or an approximation), you implement it. Sometimes the textbook says the math is \"graduate-level\" but you just... read it and it's tractable. You linearize, you approximate, you use penalty barrier methods. Not an theoretically optimal solution, but it gets the job done. I don't see a structural difference between \"turning JSON into pretty HTML\" and using OR-tools to schedule workers for a department store. Both are decomposable problems. Both are solvable. The latter just has more domain jargon. So I'm asking: what's the concrete example? What code would you write that's supposedly beyond this? I frequently see this kind of comment in AI threads that there is more sophisticated kinds of AI proof programming out there. Let me try to clarify another way. Are you claiming that say 50% of the total economic activity  is beyond AI? or is some sort of niche role that only contributes 3% to GDP? Because its very different if this \"difficult\" job is everywhere or only in a few small locations. reply",

Come back to me once you're done and we see then how much time it took you. Or remake the Gwent board game that is in Witcher 3. Make either of that mobile game so you can enjoy in the same room with the person you love. Also make sure you can make multiple decks (for Gwent) / multiple starting God (for Orlog) and you just select the start and hit \"ready to play\" (or whatever). You'll know what I mean once you understand either of these games. Good luck with having any of them made in one session and not breaking the big picture in million of pieces and you keep the big picture in your head. reply",

          "text": "I'm trying to understand where our viewpoints differ, because I suspect we have fundamentally different mental models about where programming difficulty actually lives. It sounds like you believe the hard part is decomposing problems - breaking them into subproblems, managing the \"big picture,\" keeping the architecture in your head. That this is where experience and skill matter. My mental model is the opposite: I see problem decomposition as the easy part - that's just reasoning about structure. You just keep peeling the onion until you hit algorithmically irreducible units. The hard part was always at the leaf nodes of that tree. Why I think decomposition is straightforward: People switch jobs and industries constantly. You move from one company to another, one domain to another, and you're productive quickly. How is that possible if decomposition requires deep domain expertise? I think it's because decomposition is just observing how things fit together in reality . The structure reveals itself when you look at the problem. Where I think the actual skill lived: The leaf nodes. Not chipping away until you are left with \"this is a min-cut problem\" - anyone off the street can do that. The hard part was: - Searching for the right algorithm/approach for your specific constraints - Translating that solution into your project's specific variables, coordinate system, and bookkeeping Those two things - search and translation - are precisely what AI excels at. What I think AI changed: I could walk into any building on Stanford campus right now, tap a random person (no CS required!) on the shoulder, and they could solve those leaf problems using AI tools. It no longer requires years of experience and learned skills. I think this explains our different views: If you believe the skill is in decomposition (reasoning about structure), then AI hasn't changed much. But if the skill was always in search and translation at the leaf nodes (my view), then AI has eliminated the core barrier that required job-specific expertise. Does this capture where we disagree? Am I understanding your position correctly? reply",

          "text": "I watched a youtube video showing off Orlog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rW3jtbsxZk . Challenge accepted. If you get back to me I'll livestream this on Saturday. I want to be crystal clear about what I'm claiming My Claim: AI assistance has effectively eliminated specialized job skills as a barrier. Anyone can now accomplish what previously required domain expertise, in comparable time to what a pre-AI professional would take. Specifically: - I've never written a game. I've never used a browser rigid body physics library. Never written a WebGL scene with Three.js before. Zero experience. So I should fail write. - I think I could recreate the full 3D scene, hand meshes, rigging, materials, lighting - everything you see in that screenshot - using AI assistance - I'm not going to do ALL of that in a couple hours, because even a professional game developer couldn't do it all from scratch in a couple hours. They would have assets, physics engine, rendering engine, textures, etc all because they were creating Orlog inside a larger game that provides all these affordances. - But I could do it in the same timeframe a professional would have taken pre-AI My interpretation of your challenge: You're claiming that writing the multiplayer networking and state management for a turn-based dice game is beyond what AI can help a -- what you called me \"run of the mill coder camp wanna be programmer\" -- accomplish in a reasonable timeframe. That even with a simple 2D UI, I lack the fundamental programming skills to write the multiplayer networking code and manage state transitions properly. So here's what I'll build: A multiplayer Orlog game with: - Full game logic implementing all Orlog rules and mechanics - two players can connect and play together - observers can join and watch - game state properly synced managed across clients. - Real dice physics simulation (because otherwise the game feels boring and unsatisfying - I'll grant you that point). But I'll have a server pick the dice roll values to avoid cheating. (Easiest trick in the book, just run the physics offscreen first, find the face that lands up, remap the textures, replay on screen this time), but use a library for simple rigid body physics engine because you couldn't write one from scratch in 3 hours either. - Visual approach: Simple 2D/indie game cartoon style UI, with dice rolling in a separate physics area (just compositing dice roll app at bottom of screen, results animate onto 2D board, reality is they are totally separate systems) What I need from you: 1. Is this the right interpretation? You're claiming the networking/state management is beyond what AI can help me accomplish? 2. Time predictions: - How long would a competent game developer take to build what I've described?\n\n   - How long will it take me? 3. At what point do I prove my point? What's the minimum deliverable you'd accept as having completed the challenge? Are you willing to make concrete, falsifiable predictions about this specific challenge? reply",

          "text": "I've been unhappy with project management tools for over a decade now. There's nothing for personal project management and context switching. Workflowy is cool, but it doesn't fit my workflow. It's also not profitable. Asana was great, but they started targeting teams. A lot of these tools are heavily team focused; the experience is heavily geared there. I end up using a Sublime Text plugin for personal things. Most of these tools have a terrible mobile experience, and it's still the same a decade later. The other problem is that most tools are overly flexible. Jira is customizable but it's just terrible user experience. Linear is like Jira with the 80% main features and people use it just because it's a smoother Jira. Basecamp, Trello, Todoist, Pivotal Tracker are heavily opinionated and don't try to do what they're not meant to do. But they're not my workflow either. So vibe coding a project management tool at this point makes more sense for me than trying to config Jira for personal use. Specifically, there's things like priority. I think priority matters a lot, but there's no difference between Item A of medium-high priority and Item B of medium-high priority. I like having an \"I'm feeling lucky button\" to just pick an item of high priority instead of having to think. My bug list are the following priority levels: emergency, requested, very important, important, fix if time, probably don't fix, can't repro/don't fix. I think it was retrofitted from FogBugz: https://webapps-support.ccts.uic.edu/help/topics/schedules/P... Well, it's also too much work to set up FogBugz or even customize Jira to this, nor do I want to pay for either. I've already built all the above. It's all set up in Flutter, meaning it runs on mac, windows, web, ios, android just fine. A few more days of work and I can then sync it to my phone. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had a mind-blown-moment when I learnt that Obsidian was built without any frontend JS framework. ( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

It may have changed in the last year, but if you searched for \"CRA\", it would get 0 results. Again, mind-blowing considering it was the recommended way to build apps with React. Instead, it was replaced with a section driving you towards adopting Next. Which then had to be whittled away at and updated to include other options all the while the React team acted hostile to any criticism of it. You either used Next or you were shit out of luck. > I have been outside the ecosystem for a year and looking at the shit show that is nextjs it seems things are even worse than before. My thoughts about CRA aside, you don't have to use the frameworks (I still don't). And if you remove Next from the equation, things are actually pretty cool. Suspense is cool, and you'll have to rip React Query from my cold, dead hands. reply",

Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver.

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else. Thus React has been the most stable bet for quite a while for me now. reply",

On the other hand a framework would probably slow things down for the writing experience in Obsidian, which is the main draw for me to use Obsidian. Once the writing module is written from scratch, it won't seem like such a big lift to also do all the navigation and controls by hand. That doesn't mean this is the right way for everyone. A lot of times the speed to releasing new features is more important, while the handicraft of the UI/UX is less important and in those cases using a framework is absolutely the right choice. reply",

          "text": "I build a figma clone for animation ( https://moos.app ). It is by no means a super large project (I think 40k loc) but is has reasonable frontend complexity. Most stuff is just composed of simple functions. For example routing is just an eventListener on hashchange. For state I am passing around an environment or firing events (the event system is 100 loc). For showing UI there is one convenience function to create HTML elements. Basically tag(tagName, props, ...children) (implementation also 100 loc). Each view is it's own file and manages itself. The object list can contain thousands of items so it uses a virtual list for performance (100 loc). As you can see most functionality can be implemented in around 100 lines of code. The advantage is that you can build up functions just for your needs. These functions are super easy to understand because they don't have any dependencies and the whole implementation fits on one or two screens. There is very little indirection. Another advantage is that most code is actually doing something concrete. With frameworks you often have a lot of code that is just pointing to other code, or is boiler plate code to set something up. Not having any boilerplate code also makes stepping through the debugger a lot easier. The project has no build step in development which also makes debugging easier. It does have a build step in production. Most people use frameworks to give the code structure. When writing vanillajs you need to bring the structure of the code yourself. This does take some getting used to but I think it is an essential skill for good programmers to have. On top of that many frameworks push you into structure that does not make much sense in my mind (for example seperating the view and the controller if those are always gonna change together). So to conclude: My advice for building without frameworks is, just start building. Problems will come up and you can tackle those as you go. Do you think you need to use events in your application? A simple implementation is 10 lines of code and can be written in 10 minutes. If it takes me 1 hour to not use a library I will spend that 1 hour. Most frameworks will not bring that much value. Easy things become short and hard things will become impossible. I think most value is actually brought by the language and the basic api's (DOM, CSS, etc) reply",

Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

For most people writing JavaScript for employment it is absolutely impossible to imagine any universe where a couple of lines of code could be written without something that looks like a framework.  That is not a limitation of the language, but rather a limitation of the given developer's imagination.  The problem is thus a person problem and not a technology problem. I do not use innerHTML because that is string parsing, and one of my critical performance steps is to avoid parsing from strings, except JSON.parse when needed. reply",

Don't create some shallow copy, cloned node, or other insanity.  You don't need any of that.  You don't need to litter your code, most especially your DOM nodes, with a bunch of business logic insanity. All you need is the event handler.  The event handler can be assigned to a node's event property directly, but if this is for a commercial site with lots of third party analytics/spyware you need to use a event listener instead because those third party libraries will overwrite your event assignments.  The event handler receives an event object as an argument with a reference back to the given DOM node. All the business logic should be stored in a single location representing a given business function, typically far away from the browser logic.  It makes sense when you write the code without using a framework.  If you write the code and try to make it look like a framework it will look like a framework, unsurprisingly.  If you don't do a bunch of framework component insanity it will not look like a framework. This is a person problem, not a technology problem. reply",

The only things that have improved my productivity over the years are: A) getting better at handling graph data structure, \n  B) learning how to use Regular Expressions as a code editing tool,\n  C) quit chasing every new thing, and\n  D) Typescript. Having spent the last 20+ years building Web apps, I've only just started using React, due to company policy change. And quite frankly, I think it makes it much harder to maintain a large project. My company switched to React to make apps \"easier to maintain for everyone\" and in the process I've been the only one that has managed to learn React well enough to be productive in it. Most everyone else is really struggling with getting anything beyond the most basic stuff to work. JSX encourages sloppy HTML. Props are are overly verbose. Hooks are a nightmare. Contexts are gross. Portals are a stupid hack for the very, very stupid reason of making it nearly impossible for parent elements to read anything about their children. The whole \"props down, events up\" paradigm is woefully naive and half of React exists to get around it because of that. So yeah, if all you know is react, you've already been on the hard path. reply",

My advice is to go and learn a proper architecture (MVVM is a great fit in my opinion for MOST things) and then figure out how to implement that with something you enjoy using. My only bit of advice here is that the closer you stick to the underlying web platform the better off you’re going to be so if you want a concrete recommendation something like Lit here gives you all the primitives you need along with great performance, documentation and developer experience. reply",

          "text": "It’s always mildly amusing how many engineers believe that React is a framework. I personally attribute it to lack of experience—once you’ve used enough proper frameworks, you’d laugh at that comparison. The fact that React is and always has been literally defined as a library right on its website doesn’t seem to stop them. Incidentally, many of the issues people have with React are attributable to this mistake: knowing what a framework is supposed to be, one might expect React to take care of everything, and when it turns out you’re on your own and using React in a complex project means (whether consciously or not) coming up with a homegrown React-based framework of your own, or using a collection of disparate extras that fill in the blanks (like CRA), by then it’s already a hairy mess of a codebase in a desperate need of refactoring. React lacks most of framework traits. The library does reactive rendering and contains a somewhat restricted set of low-level primitives around it. Even its DOM integration is handled by a separate, optional library (ReactDOM). Someone could complain it feels like with Vercel the direction for React is to become closer to a framework (now with RSC and JSX runtime being part of React), but still it is nowhere near a state where the phrase “a framework like React” rings true—and, in fact, Vercel’s interests are aligned with keeping React more of a library than a framework so that more people use Next and are upsold Vercel’s hosting, and Next is in fact a framework in the full sense of the word, comparable to Django or Rails. Similarly, Vue, Angular, Marko, Astro, Qwik, etc. are frameworks. They provide you with project structure, scaffolding, and a lot of batteries. The fact that many of them are, in fact, using React under the hood speaks volumes. reply",

Now I'm trying to define inputs/outputs (OpenAPI spec, wireframes, etc.) and database schemas myself and have the model fill in the middle using the strictest language I can (usually TypeScript) so that some bugs will come out at compile time.

If you manage to cause for the queues to fill up then the crawler wont be able to send as many requests. For example, you can allow the crawler to open the socket but you only send the data very slowly causing the queues to get filled quickly with busy workers. Depending on how the crawler is designed this may or may not work. If they are using SQS with Lambda then that will obviously not work but it will fire back nevertheless because the serverless functions will be running for longer (5 - 15 minutes). Another technique that comes to mind is to try to force the client to upgrade the connection (i.e. websocket). See what will happen. Mostly it will fail but even if it gets stalled for 30 seconds that is a win. reply",

You'd have to find a way to generate absurd amounts of egress traffic - absurd enough to be noticed compared to billions of HTTP requests. 2B requests at 1 KB/request is 2 TB/month so they're likely paying a double-digit dollar amount just for the traffic they're sending to you (wtf - where does that money come from?). But since AWS considers this fine, I'd absolutely take the \"redirecting the entirety of the traffic to aws abuse report page\" approach. If they consider it abuse - great, they can go turn it off then. The bot could behave differently but at least curl won't add a referer header or similar when it is redirected, so the obvious target would be their instance hosting the bot, not you. Actually, I would find the biggest file I can that is hosted by Amazon itself (not another AWS customer) and redirect them to it. I bet they're hosting linux images somewhere. Besides being more annoying (and thus hopefully attention-getting) for Amazon, it should keep the bot busy for longer, reducing the amount of traffic hitting you. If the bot doesn't eat files over a certain size, try to find something smaller or something that doesn't report the size in response to a HEAD request. reply",

Specifically, it targets crawlers that scrape data for LLMs - but really, like the plants it is named after, it'll eat just about anything that finds it's way inside. It works by generating an endless sequences of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go back into a the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, Markov-babble is added to the pages, to give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725147 Is this a good solution?? reply",

Here is my scenario:<p>My team is dealing with a lot of information: Wikis, Code repos, Monitoring dashboards, internal chat messages, emails, Task tickets, related systems, etc.<p>There are many cases when we need to do ad-hoc searches for anything related to a concept. For instance, imagine if someone makes a change to a metric, there is a need to find all dashboards that might be using this metric to make sure they are still valid after the change.<p>I don't want to just fix this problem, but create the ability to find related information in ad-hoc cases.<p>The ramp-up time is not important, as long as some positive value can be created with a small initial effort.<p>Any existing products (Paid/Free/Open Source, etc) and any references to existing knowledge (designs, discussions) about this would be really appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I've _never_ seen a wiki or internal documentation stay up to date. My experience has been to encourage public blogging / speaking of technical information. If its public, there are several benefits. First you need to explain to people with little context from the company. You also feel scrutiny to make it accurate and not embarrass yourself. And readers will see the date of authorship, and have a sense of when this information was true. And of course, Google is a better search engine than anything you'll have internally! For example, when I worked on search at Reddit, I didn't point people at anything internal (that stuff rots) but instead I would point people at places like: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1985mnj/bringing... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtF1gyHsSM The downside to this approach is companies are too precious about IP so don't want you to be specific. (despite it almost certaintly not being special). Also company blogs can get over-edited to the point where they lose authenticity in favor of SEO spam. This isn't the tool to use for things like runbooks, etc. It's a more useful thing for broader context. I wish more companies just gave their developers their own personal blogs, and were less precious about preventing speaking. reply",

Hence, the automation and textiles. It doesn't need to be plaintext, just something universal and human-readable. Could be formatted in markdown, yaml, json, be single email-files, everything you can find with simple tools and make connections with. The version-control and it's report then will allow you to follow the trail of work, to discover what was discussed and change around the same time, to find connections. And it's never wrong to have a reversible history of your stuff. And maybe along the way you can motivate people to also write some proper documentation here and there, and add some more fancy tools on-top. reply",

          "text": "You might want to look into knowledge graphs (KGs), graph databases, ontologies, and similar. I personally and professionally used these to do some cool things, like run audits across different systems simultaneously. Common stack would include Protege for creating the ontologies (i.e., a schema of how the things you're interested in link to each other), Ontotext Refine or py scripts to populate the graphs, and Ontotext GraphDB or Neo4j AuraDB for storing them. It's relatively easy to then connect this knowledge base to an LLM, and get more flexibility out of it. That said, there aren't that many user-friendly tools that get the most out of KGs. Most people I worked with weren't interested in KGs or knowledge bases themselves, they just wanted their particular problem solved. And often, it was easier to justify purchasing a subscription to managed tools that (claim to) solve the problem. So, unless you're OK with building some middleware to combine user apps with KGs, it won't stick with others, in my experience. reply",

Obviously only as good as the user search query. I spent close to a 100 hours writing tests to get it working close to 100% of the time. Eventually I dropped the embeddings because I could generate the opensearch query on the fly. So it was pretty lean and easy. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be? reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information.

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food.

Just a treasure trove of data A man can dream - kudos to you for actually making it a reality - great inspiration Question for you: in general, how much does this stuff cost? what if you wanted to expand to testing beyond plastic, e.g., verifying the potency of ingredients in supplements, verifying cleaning product ingredients, etc., is that possible? reply",

          "text": "For an individual acting on their own, single tests for phthalates and BPA/BPS/BPF normally cost ~$500. Laboratory.love tests three samples from different lots to ensure reliability (as PlasticList found variation of up to 59% between lots of identical products). Thanks to volume pricing and operational efficiency, we're able to target $425 per sample ($1,275 for triplicate testing). This covers not just the chemical analysis but also product acquisition, shipping, and operational costs. Right now there is only about 10% margin left as breathing room. My partner lab specifically offers 300+ unique tests across the following categories: Contaminants, Elemental, Allergen, Preservatives and Additives, Microbial, and Phytochemical, Vitamin, and Actives\" So yes, expansion is definitely possible! If a billionaire wanted to fund a project like this it could certainly convert dollars into data, it's just a matter of choosing which products and contaminants to start chewing through first to ensure the data creates positive change in the real world. reply",

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead.

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Even Microsoft's own security teams publish blog posts enthusiastically explaining how they found this strange ancient tech from some Windows archaeological dig site, lol.

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile.

The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens.

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

One of the joys of learning HTML when it tended to be hand-written was that if you made a mistake, you'd still see something just with distorted output. That was a lot more approachable for a lot of people who were put off \"real\" programming languages because they were overwhelmed by terrible error messages any time they missed a bracket or misspelled something. If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages. The kind of thing where you could miss a bracket on line 47 but end up with a compiler error complaining about something 20 lines away. Rust ( in particular ) got everyone to bring up their game with respect to meaningful compiler errors. But in the days of XHTML?

Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

Also, the only thing specific to Next that survived in MacOSX and iOS was ObjectiveC and the whole NextStep APIs, which honestly I don't think it a great thing.

It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

          "text": "I just did a brief frontend job for a smart-top device, so take this with a grain of salt, but basically when you're planning to release a cheap mobile phone (It was very common until a few years ago to find weird in-house phone brands in European supermarkets) you mainly license a SoC and some sort of development platform from a foundry and that's it. Most drivers, radio devices, kernel, android releases are those you get at the beginning, you can't really change a thing due to them being closed source or just one step above from being a firmware blob with a few kernel hooks and once your contract expires your devices die with it. We investigated if we could at least maintain the software on our own (so to not tell some telco clients their streaming devices were gonna die after 4 years) but it was a big fat no from the licensees. And reverse engineering what we already had was forbidden by contract. In other words, if you want yo build a free phone, you need to build a free radio, a free storage solution, thousands of weird DACs, graphic cards, screen controllers, sensors and whatnot. Making sure you're not infringing on some patents. It's like starting from ground-up. And it's expensive . A possible solution would be to invest into building into a raspberry-pi binary compatible base platform (and take advantage of their already open sourced drivers), but it was 100% economically unfeasible for a 100-200€ device. reply",

          "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(2002_film) A crazy watch. Two brothers are making a documentary on rookie firefighters in late 2001. The crew goes out to look at a possible gas leak, a loud plane is heard, the camera pans up, and the North Tower is hit. It was one of three recordings of that hit and the only clear one. The rest of the documentary follows the crew into the towers. No one knows what's going on, the scenes are chaotic but also calm as the firefighters try to figure out what to do. Then the second tower falls while (one of the brothers) is in the first. One of the most incredible things I've ever seen. I think it was well known when it came out, but it's been overshadowed especially since searching \"9/11 documentary\" gives a million results. If you want to see one of the craziest human experiences unfold in front of you, there's no other film like this. reply",

          "text": "My second favorite “Wild, Wild, Country”, but it was mentioned already at the top of the first list.  I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been trying to articulate why coding feels less pleasant now.<p><i>The problem:</i> You can't win anymore.<p>The old way: You'd think about the problem. Draw some diagrams. Understand what you're actually trying to do. Then write the code. Understanding was mandatory. You solved it.<p>The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise.<p>So I feel pressure to always, always, start by info dumping the problem description to AI and gamble for a one-shot. Voice transcription for 10 minutes, hit send, hope I get something first try, if not hope I can iterate until something works. And when even something does work = zero satisfaction because I don't have the same depth of understanding of the solution. Its no longer my code, my idea. It's just some code I found online. `import solution from chatgpt`<p>If I think about the problem, I feel inefficient. \"Why did you waste 2 hours on that? AI would've done it in 10 minutes.\"<p>If I use AI to help, the work doesn't feel like mine. When I show it to anyone, the implicit response is: \"Yeah, I could've prompted for that too.\"<p>The steering and judgment I apply to AI outputs is invisible. Nobody sees which suggestions I rejected, how I refined the prompts, or what decisions I made. So all credit flows to the AI by default.<p><i>The result:</i> Nothing feels satisfying anymore. Every problem I solve by hand feels too slow. Every problem I solve with AI feels like it doesn't count. There's this constant background feeling that whatever I just did, someone else would've done it better and faster.<p>I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts. Things that sounded fun. Writing a toy database to understand how they work, implementing a small Redis clone. Now that feels stupid. Like I'd be wasting time on details the AI is supposed to handle. It bothers me that my reaction to these blog posts has changed so much. 3 years ago I would be bookmarking a blog post to try it out for myself that weekend. Now those 200 lines of simple code feels only one sentence prompt away and thus waste of time.<p><i>Am I alone in this?</i><p>Does anyone else feel this pressure to skip understanding? Where thinking feels like you're not using the tool correctly? In the old days, I understood every problem I worked on. Now I feel pressure to skip understanding and just ship. I hate it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Very few people have actually vocalised the \"why do I even need to learn this if I can write a prompt\" sentiment out loud, but it has been voiced, and even from those who don't say it there's a very definite 'vibe' that is all but screaming it. Whereas the vibe in the lecture theatre 4 years ago was far more nerdy and enthusiastic. It makes me feel very sorry for this new generation that they will never get to enjoy the same feeling of satisfaction from solving a hard problem with code you thought and wrote from scratch. Ironically, I've had to incorporate some AI stuff in my course as a result of needing to remain \"current\", which almost feels like it validates that cynical sentiment that this soulless way is the way to be doing things now. reply",

I understand why people dislike it, but it feels as if these tools where specifically made for me; and I am getting more and more exited while these keep getting better.

          "text": "That's not my experience. Over christmas I re wrote a restaurant POS application from laravel to vue/wrangler using bolt + chatgpt. My exact steps: 1) I took my db schema and got chatGPT to convert it to typescript types and stub data. 2) Uploaded these types to bolt and asked it one by one to create vue components to display this data(Catalog screen, Payment Dialogs, Tables page etc) and to use fetcher functions that return stub data. 3) Finally I asked it replace stub data with supabase.rpc calls, and create postgres functions to serve this data. While I had most of the app done in a few days, testing, styling and adding bug fixing took a month. Some minor stuff was done manually by me: Receipt printer integration integration because bolt wasn't good at epson xml or related libraries that time. Finally we released early feb and we received extremely good feedback from our customers. However now I'm using claude and even higher percentage of code is generated by it now. Our feature velocity is also great. After launch we have added following features in 6m 1) Split Table Payments\n2) Payment Terminal Integration\n3) Visual Floor plan viewer\n4) Mobile POS for waiters without tablet\n5) Reports, Dashboard, Import/Export\n6) Loyalty programs with many different types of programs\n7) Self-service Webshop with realtime group ordering\n8) Improved tax handling\n9) Multicourse orders(\"La'suite\")\n10) Many other smaller features This would be very hard to achieve without AI for most one-person engineering teams. Although tbf not impossible. > The new way: The entire premise of AI coding tools is to automate the thinking, not just the typing. You're supposed to describe a problem and get a solution without understanding the details. That's the labor-saving promise. I think here the OP introduces a strawman since as many people have pointed out, the labour saving happens in automating menial tasks and no one sane should give up \"understanding the details\". > >I was thinking of all the classic exploratory learning blog posts.

          "text": "Reading HN I seem to be in the minority but AI has made programming a lot more fun for me. I've been an engineer for nearly 25 years and 95% of the work is rather mindless boilerplate. I know exactly what I need to do next, it just takes time and iteration. The \"you think about the problem and draw diagrams\" part of you describe probably makes up less than 5% of a typical engineering workflow, depending on what you work on. I work in a scientific field where it's probably more than for someone working in web dev, but even here it's very little, and usually only at the beginning of a project. Afterwards it's all about iteration. And using AI doesn't change that part at all, you still need to design the high level solution for an LLM to produce anything remotely useful. I never encountered the problem of not understanding details of the AI's implementation that people here seem to describe. I still review all the code and need to ask the LLM to make small adjustments if I'm not happy with it, especially around not-so-elegant abstractions. Tasks that I actively avoided previously because they seemed like a hassle, like large refactorings, I no longer avoid now because I can ask an AI to do most of it. I feel so much productive and work is more satisfying because I get to knock out all these chores that I had resistance to before. Brainstorming with an AI about potential solutions to a hard problem is also more fun for me, and more productive, than doing research the old ways. So instead of drawing diagrams I now just have conversations. I can't say for certain whether using LLMs has made me much more productive (overall it likely has but for certain tasks it hasn't), but it definitely has made work more fun for me. Another side effect has been that I'm learning new things more frequently when using AI. When I brainstorm solutions with an AI or ask for an implementation, it sometimes uses libraries and abstractions I have not seen before, especially around very low level code that I'm not super familiar with. Previously I was much more likely to use or do things the one way I know. reply",

I used to work in land surveying, entering that field around the turn of the millennium just as digitalisation was hitting the industry in a big way. A common feeling among existing journeymen was one of confusion. Fear and dislike of these threatening changes, which seemed to neutralise all the hard-won professional skills. Expertise with the old equipment. Understanding of how to do things closer to first-principles. Ability to draw plans by hand. To assemble the datasets in the complex and particular old ways. And of course, to mentor juniors in the same. Suddenly, some juniors coming in were young computer whizzes. Speeding past their seniors in these new ways. But still only juniors, for all that - still green, no matter what the tech. With years and decades yet, to earn their stripes, their professionalism in all it's myriad aspects. And for the seniors, their human aptitudes (which got them there in the first place) didn't vanish. They absorbed the changes, stuck with their smart peers, and evolved to match the environment. Would they have rathered that everything in the world had stayed the same as before? Of course. But is that a valid choice, professionally speaking? or in life itself? Not really. reply",

You said \"the only exception here is learning\" - and that exception was my hobby . Programming simple things wasn't work for me. It was entertainment. It was what I did for fun on weekends. Reading a blog post about writing a toy database or a parser combinator library and then spending a Saturday afternoon implementing it myself. that was like going to an amusement park. It was a few hours of enjoyable, bounded exploration. I could follow my curiosity, learn something new, and have fun doing it. And you're right: if an LLM can solve it with the same quality, it's not a problem worthy of human effort. I agree with that logic. I've internalized it from years in the industry, from working with AI, from learning to make decisions about what to spend time on. But here's what's been lost: that logic has closed the amusement park . All those simple, fun learning projects now feel stupid. When I see those blog posts now, my gut reaction is \"why would I waste time on that? That's one prompt away.\" The feeling that it's \"not worthy\" has completely drained the joy out of it. I can't turn off that instinct anymore. I know those 200 lines of code are trivial. I know AI can generate them. And so doing it myself feels like I'm deliberately choosing to be inefficient, like I'm LARPing at being a programmer instead of actually learning something valuable. The problem isn't that I disagree with you. The problem is that I agree with you so completely that I can no longer have fun. The only \"worthy\" problems left are the hard ones AI can't do.

So I have to break it down into several sessions giving only partial details (divide and conquer) otherwise will confabulate stupid code. Before this \"AI\" I had to do the mundane tasks of boilerplate. Now I don't. That's a win for me. The grand thinking and the whole picture of the projects is still mine, and I keep trying to give it to \"AI\" from time to time, except each time it spits BS. Also it helps that as a freelancer my stuff gets used by my client directly in production (no manager above, that has a group leader, that has a CEO, that has client's IT department, that finally has the client as final user). That's another good feeling. Corporations with layers above layers are the soul sucking of programming joy. Freelancing allowed me to avoid that. reply",

          "text": "I'm curious: could you give me an example of code that AI can't help with? I ask because I've worked across different domains: V8 bytecode optimizations, HPC at Sandia (differential equations on 50k nodes, adaptive mesh refinement heuristics), resource allocation and admission control for CI systems, custom network UDP network stack for mobile apps https://neumob.com/ . In every case in my memory, the AI coding tools of today would have been useful. You say your work is \"very specific\" and AI is \"too stupid\" for it. This just makes me very curious what does that look like concretely? What programming task exists that can't be decomposed into smaller problems? My experience as an engineer is that I'm already just applying known solutions that researchers figured out. That's the job. Every problem I've encountered in my professional life was solvable - you decompose it, you research up an algorithm (or an approximation), you implement it. Sometimes the textbook says the math is \"graduate-level\" but you just... read it and it's tractable. You linearize, you approximate, you use penalty barrier methods. Not an theoretically optimal solution, but it gets the job done. I don't see a structural difference between \"turning JSON into pretty HTML\" and using OR-tools to schedule workers for a department store. Both are decomposable problems. Both are solvable. The latter just has more domain jargon. So I'm asking: what's the concrete example? What code would you write that's supposedly beyond this? I frequently see this kind of comment in AI threads that there is more sophisticated kinds of AI proof programming out there. Let me try to clarify another way. Are you claiming that say 50% of the total economic activity  is beyond AI? or is some sort of niche role that only contributes 3% to GDP? Because its very different if this \"difficult\" job is everywhere or only in a few small locations. reply",

          "text": "I'm trying to understand where our viewpoints differ, because I suspect we have fundamentally different mental models about where programming difficulty actually lives. It sounds like you believe the hard part is decomposing problems - breaking them into subproblems, managing the \"big picture,\" keeping the architecture in your head. That this is where experience and skill matter. My mental model is the opposite: I see problem decomposition as the easy part - that's just reasoning about structure. You just keep peeling the onion until you hit algorithmically irreducible units. The hard part was always at the leaf nodes of that tree. Why I think decomposition is straightforward: People switch jobs and industries constantly. You move from one company to another, one domain to another, and you're productive quickly. How is that possible if decomposition requires deep domain expertise? I think it's because decomposition is just observing how things fit together in reality . The structure reveals itself when you look at the problem. Where I think the actual skill lived: The leaf nodes. Not chipping away until you are left with \"this is a min-cut problem\" - anyone off the street can do that. The hard part was: - Searching for the right algorithm/approach for your specific constraints - Translating that solution into your project's specific variables, coordinate system, and bookkeeping Those two things - search and translation - are precisely what AI excels at. What I think AI changed: I could walk into any building on Stanford campus right now, tap a random person (no CS required!) on the shoulder, and they could solve those leaf problems using AI tools. It no longer requires years of experience and learned skills. I think this explains our different views: If you believe the skill is in decomposition (reasoning about structure), then AI hasn't changed much. But if the skill was always in search and translation at the leaf nodes (my view), then AI has eliminated the core barrier that required job-specific expertise. Does this capture where we disagree? Am I understanding your position correctly? reply",

          "text": "I watched a youtube video showing off Orlog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rW3jtbsxZk . Challenge accepted. If you get back to me I'll livestream this on Saturday. I want to be crystal clear about what I'm claiming My Claim: AI assistance has effectively eliminated specialized job skills as a barrier. Anyone can now accomplish what previously required domain expertise, in comparable time to what a pre-AI professional would take. Specifically: - I've never written a game. I've never used a browser rigid body physics library. Never written a WebGL scene with Three.js before. Zero experience. So I should fail write. - I think I could recreate the full 3D scene, hand meshes, rigging, materials, lighting - everything you see in that screenshot - using AI assistance - I'm not going to do ALL of that in a couple hours, because even a professional game developer couldn't do it all from scratch in a couple hours. They would have assets, physics engine, rendering engine, textures, etc all because they were creating Orlog inside a larger game that provides all these affordances. - But I could do it in the same timeframe a professional would have taken pre-AI My interpretation of your challenge: You're claiming that writing the multiplayer networking and state management for a turn-based dice game is beyond what AI can help a -- what you called me \"run of the mill coder camp wanna be programmer\" -- accomplish in a reasonable timeframe. That even with a simple 2D UI, I lack the fundamental programming skills to write the multiplayer networking code and manage state transitions properly. So here's what I'll build: A multiplayer Orlog game with: - Full game logic implementing all Orlog rules and mechanics - two players can connect and play together - observers can join and watch - game state properly synced managed across clients. - Real dice physics simulation (because otherwise the game feels boring and unsatisfying - I'll grant you that point). But I'll have a server pick the dice roll values to avoid cheating. (Easiest trick in the book, just run the physics offscreen first, find the face that lands up, remap the textures, replay on screen this time), but use a library for simple rigid body physics engine because you couldn't write one from scratch in 3 hours either. - Visual approach: Simple 2D/indie game cartoon style UI, with dice rolling in a separate physics area (just compositing dice roll app at bottom of screen, results animate onto 2D board, reality is they are totally separate systems) What I need from you: 1. Is this the right interpretation? You're claiming the networking/state management is beyond what AI can help me accomplish? 2. Time predictions: - How long would a competent game developer take to build what I've described?\n\n   - How long will it take me? 3. At what point do I prove my point? What's the minimum deliverable you'd accept as having completed the challenge? Are you willing to make concrete, falsifiable predictions about this specific challenge? reply",

Now that LLMs do the fun part (actually writing the code), those parts are all that’s left. The job now feels quite different than the one I signed up for a decade+ ago. The only options I see are to accept that with a sigh or reject automation of the fun part and lose employability (worst case) or be nagged by anxiety that eventually that’ll happen. reply",

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

I wrote a quick-and-dirty program that reads the authoritative list of all AWS IP ranges from https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json (more about that URL at the blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ip-ranges-json/ ), and creates rules in Windows Firewall to simply block all of them.  Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

If you manage to cause for the queues to fill up then the crawler wont be able to send as many requests. For example, you can allow the crawler to open the socket but you only send the data very slowly causing the queues to get filled quickly with busy workers. Depending on how the crawler is designed this may or may not work. If they are using SQS with Lambda then that will obviously not work but it will fire back nevertheless because the serverless functions will be running for longer (5 - 15 minutes). Another technique that comes to mind is to try to force the client to upgrade the connection (i.e. websocket). See what will happen. Mostly it will fail but even if it gets stalled for 30 seconds that is a win. reply",

You'd have to find a way to generate absurd amounts of egress traffic - absurd enough to be noticed compared to billions of HTTP requests. 2B requests at 1 KB/request is 2 TB/month so they're likely paying a double-digit dollar amount just for the traffic they're sending to you (wtf - where does that money come from?). But since AWS considers this fine, I'd absolutely take the \"redirecting the entirety of the traffic to aws abuse report page\" approach. If they consider it abuse - great, they can go turn it off then. The bot could behave differently but at least curl won't add a referer header or similar when it is redirected, so the obvious target would be their instance hosting the bot, not you. Actually, I would find the biggest file I can that is hosted by Amazon itself (not another AWS customer) and redirect them to it. I bet they're hosting linux images somewhere. Besides being more annoying (and thus hopefully attention-getting) for Amazon, it should keep the bot busy for longer, reducing the amount of traffic hitting you. If the bot doesn't eat files over a certain size, try to find something smaller or something that doesn't report the size in response to a HEAD request. reply",

Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Hooks being 5 years old and being the predominant tool for certain tasks shows that the community only figured out how to solve a particular problem 5 years ago. Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

That is a significant difference. Please stop repeating the 5 year number. It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

Since the whole project was migrated over from React, I was able to improve performance to a degree that would have been impossible using React, it's a breadth of fresh air to open the performance and memory tab and to be able to optimise things from there to get 60FPS no matter what whilst preventing massive ram usage because those frameworks runs all sort of code that is out of your control. Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver. Honestly, add some event signaling and XHR and you're further along to a smooth SPA-like experience than you might think. reply",

          "text": "First, I decide if I think the app will have lots of client-side interaction. As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "They're probably using some features of LiveView; I'm not too familiar with how  HTMX works, but with LiveView you can define all of your logic and state handling on the _backend_, with page diffs pushed to the client over a websocket channel (all handled out of the box). It comes with some tradeoffs compared to fully client-side state, but it's a really comfortable paradigm to program in, especially if you're not from a frontend background, and really clicks with the wider Elixir/Erlang problem solving approach. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#handlin... Hooks let you do things like have your DOM update live, but then layer on some JS in response. For example you could define a custom `<chart>` component, which is inserted into the DOM with `data-points=[...]`, and have a hook then 'hydrate' it with e.g. a D3 or VegaLite plot. Since Phoenix/LiveView is handling the state, your JS needs only be concerned about that last-mile JS integration; no need to pair it with another virtual DOM / state management system. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#client-... reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else. Thus React has been the most stable bet for quite a while for me now. reply",

As a result, I would argue that the overlap between the skillset and work needed to build an app like Obsidian overlaps more with most web applications than most desktop and mobile applications. You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application. How to build a large front-end app on non-web technologies (Swift, C++/QT, C#, etc) is also an interesting question but I didn't understand that as being the topic of this conversation. reply",

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

          "text": "The reasons I avoid large frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and even jQuery is that they are aren't necessary.  They are code decoration that slows things down.  Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

The first example is okay for a one off but can't be reused as a component. It's also easy to get in a place where you have to update 3-4 different handlers to include a logic change. In a component based library/framework, you ideally update the state logic in one place and the UI just reflects that.\nFor example, making the UI dynamic with a button that adds/removes multiple items that need this show/hide logic, you would need to attach new listeners, clean up listeners, clean up DOM items, and so on... my first example was only illustrative, but not to be taken literally. There a complex UI state in many apps, and reactivity with component based reuse is easier to manage and make sure all states are covered. Many times in my jquery years 10-15 years ago I had failed to update one piece of the DOM and there would be bugs that just aren't happening with component UIs. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5.

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

          "text": "I've been working on a 3D voxel-based game engine for like 10 years in my spare time. The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

          "text": "As a bio hobbyist, this is fantastic!  I don't do enough volume of PCR to think of it as expensive, but your use case of high-volume/automatic sounds fantastic! (And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

I have finished around 400 so far and I am now focusing on adding test cases, writing implementations in Python and C, and creating formal proofs in Lean. It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

          "text": "Before generics, Go sorting usually looked like this: type ByValue []int func (a ByValue) Len() int           { return len(a) }\nfunc (a ByValue) Swap(i, j int)      { a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i] }\nfunc (a ByValue) Less(i, j int) bool { return a[i] < a[j] } sort.Sort(ByValue(a)) It worked fine but felt a bit awkward for small programs. After Go 1.18, you can do it directly with generics: s := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9}\nslices.Sort(s) Much simpler and expressive, yet still type safe. I really like how Go kept it minimal without adding too many abstractions. reply",

Golang, like Python and JS, is garbage-collected; in some cases this is helpful for focusing attention on the central semantics of the algorithms, but it does have the disadvantage that it makes reasoning about space behavior and runtime performance much more difficult.  One of Quicksort's chief benefits, for example, is that it's in-place, which the Python version in your \"cheat sheet\" isn't. reply",

I've been looking on and off for 2/3 <i>years</i> but only had <i>1</i> offer. My guess is my consultancy background isn't translating well on paper for the startup landscape.<p>We don't operate like a traditional consulting agency. I function as a Product Engineer (Full Stack and GenAI) including client-facing responsibilities, talking with stakeholders, challenging designers' UX/UI deliverables, partial team management, ownership of the internal AI tooling and some public-facing marketing stuff. I think all of this doesn't show up properly on resume's experiences.<p>I'm confident in my tech and soft skills. The main thing I lack is ownership of an ongoing production product with a massive user base, as we typically focus on project bootstrapping.<p>How do I properly showcase my product-oriented skills? I'm usually screened out or rejected after the first interview, suggesting the issue is primarily with my experience presentation or content.<p>If the issue is actually in my skill set, how can I effectively evolve in that direction while staying in my current position?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

If you do the work right (ie all the non-programming stuff) and you survive, then the long-term rewards are very satisfying. 90% will fail. 10% will succeed. And we all believe we are in the 20% right? reply",

I had no trouble getting full time job offers from 3rd party consulting companies within 2 weeks after being Amazoned and again last year. But, I seem to be toxic to product companies - more so than before I got into consulting.  I’ve gotten more rejections the two times I was looking as an architect (it was a plan B) than I got before joining AWS and I was a developer. I honestly can’t blame them, now I parachute into a company, lead an implementation and I’m gone in 3-9 months.  Why would I hire me to be responsible for long term strategic vision who they need to be around for 2-3 years? But to answer your question, you need to get on larger long term projects.  There are some projects at my company where the tech lead has been leading an implementation for over a year with a team. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same.

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Maybe one day I'll be able to mint money by doing maintenance consulting for some old DCOM based systems, the sort of thing where knowing what an OXID resolver is can help and AI can't do it well because there's not enough example code on GitHub. reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

          "text": ">- XHTML. [...] Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly? XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

Do you try to maintain any of the HTML semantics or just render plain text? If it’s plain text, that’s useless. If you’re rendering anything with any semantics, then you need to know how to parse it. You’re back where you started. Granted, I could ensure that my code was valid XHTML, but I’m a hypermeticulous autistic weirdo, and most other people aren’t.

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

Another possibility they were exploring was buying BeOS, which would have been pretty interesting because it was an OS built from scratch in the 90's without any of the cruft from the 70's. Also, the only thing specific to Next that survived in MacOSX and iOS was ObjectiveC and the whole NextStep APIs, which honestly I don't think it a great thing. It was pretty cool in the 90's but when the iPhone was released it was already kinda obsolete. For the kernel, Linux or FreeBSD would have worked just the same. reply",

It was originally more planned to be a Blackberry competitor, and the early Android handset prototype concepts were all blackberry knockoffs with similar physical keyboard layouts.

It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

Then define a minimal CI platform specific pipeline to checkout your repo then run the corresponding portable shell script or makefile recipe that actually does the work to build, test artefacts and push them somewhere. by structuring things this way there's a fair chance that you can still get a hotfix build out the door if your CI platform is on fire, and also you dont have to rewrite everything each time you need to migrate back and forth between jenkins, github, gitlab, google cloud build, or this year's novelty platform vendor who impressed your leadership team > How do you manage deploying to different environments? have an environment config repo storing desired state of per env config in a bunch of sibling folders. have tip of main branch of this env config repo indicate the desired state of all environments.  write a shell script to automate deployment that can be run manually from a dev machine keep this environment config repo separate from the repo(s) which have the responsibility of maintaining and producing the deployable artifacts. keep secrets in secret managers, out of version control. if you wish, define a job in your CI platform that wraps this deploy script that can be manually triggered to deploy revision A of thing B to env C. > How do you implement artifacts versioning? if you have a CI platform that will maintain state of an incrementing integer build number, version artifacts with that build number if you dont have that, version artifacts with the short sha hash of the commit > context team maintaining a backend service or three in a non tech enterprise megacorp, boring mature industry, for services consumed internally, not directly consumed by external customers once you've got a rough process that works and you've been operating it for 6 months, it's more about identifying what your actual CI and deployment pain points are are (if any) and if they are worth solving, and seeing if there's something incremental and low risk you can do to improve the current situation given your current constraints.  solve the problems you actually have (if any), not the problems you want to have. reply",

          "text": "I've _never_ seen a wiki or internal documentation stay up to date. My experience has been to encourage public blogging / speaking of technical information. If its public, there are several benefits. First you need to explain to people with little context from the company. You also feel scrutiny to make it accurate and not embarrass yourself. And readers will see the date of authorship, and have a sense of when this information was true. And of course, Google is a better search engine than anything you'll have internally! For example, when I worked on search at Reddit, I didn't point people at anything internal (that stuff rots) but instead I would point people at places like: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1985mnj/bringing... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtF1gyHsSM The downside to this approach is companies are too precious about IP so don't want you to be specific. (despite it almost certaintly not being special). Also company blogs can get over-edited to the point where they lose authenticity in favor of SEO spam. This isn't the tool to use for things like runbooks, etc. It's a more useful thing for broader context. I wish more companies just gave their developers their own personal blogs, and were less precious about preventing speaking. reply",

Write scripts which are regularly automatically export all data, configs, communication, etc. into a centralized storage which is under version control with an automatic commit every day, which is also exported into a report of that day's changes. Then use grep or whatever to search it. People will not maintain knowledge bases unless you force them. So remove as much friction as possible and make as accessible as possible. Hence, the automation and textiles. It doesn't need to be plaintext, just something universal and human-readable. Could be formatted in markdown, yaml, json, be single email-files, everything you can find with simple tools and make connections with. The version-control and it's report then will allow you to follow the trail of work, to discover what was discussed and change around the same time, to find connections. And it's never wrong to have a reversible history of your stuff. And maybe along the way you can motivate people to also write some proper documentation here and there, and add some more fancy tools on-top. reply",

On Jira you can either directly link to another item, link to a Confluence page or leave a comment with the unique string (if the boards are not connected). Every git branch and commit contains a Jira ID string, even down to \"description\" fields in resource properties or meta tags. The idea is a future engineer who I will never meet has a starting point to understand the context of the change. Projects on GitLab get a \"release\" too which contains the Jira ID, or possibly multiple in the auto-generated CHANGELOG. It's not perfect and does require good discipline however I feel a professional responsibility to make the extra effort. reply",

          "text": "You might want to look into knowledge graphs (KGs), graph databases, ontologies, and similar. I personally and professionally used these to do some cool things, like run audits across different systems simultaneously. Common stack would include Protege for creating the ontologies (i.e., a schema of how the things you're interested in link to each other), Ontotext Refine or py scripts to populate the graphs, and Ontotext GraphDB or Neo4j AuraDB for storing them. It's relatively easy to then connect this knowledge base to an LLM, and get more flexibility out of it. That said, there aren't that many user-friendly tools that get the most out of KGs. Most people I worked with weren't interested in KGs or knowledge bases themselves, they just wanted their particular problem solved. And often, it was easier to justify purchasing a subscription to managed tools that (claim to) solve the problem. So, unless you're OK with building some middleware to combine user apps with KGs, it won't stick with others, in my experience. reply",

I would use OpenAI api calls to generate the open search query based on user text input. For example, user could search “what tasks are assigned to Jake that are at least 50% complete and due in the in the next 2 weeks” and it would be able to return relevant results. Obviously only as good as the user search query. I spent close to a 100 hours writing tests to get it working close to 100% of the time. Eventually I dropped the embeddings because I could generate the opensearch query on the fly. So it was pretty lean and easy. reply",

          "text": "I think the answer, like almost everything in software engineering, is, \"It depends.\" How well defined are your requirements? Do you need/want a prototype to play around with to get a better perspective on your needs? What scale of project are you building? How novel is what you're trying to build - is it a technical play or is it more a marketing/sales play that just needs some software behind it? Building prototypes with AI is very empowering. Rewriting large, technical codebases is a recipe for frustration. Shipping lots of \"micro-SaaS\" products using AI seems reasonable as long as you get value quickly and move onto the next one rather than going deep for years. They might also work well for smaller games. A lot of people will say that you don't internalize what you've built when using AI. This has the potential to be true, but it doesn't necessarily need to be true. I was surprisingly pleased by how much deeper I thought about functional requirements after working with AI to create a functional spec., then a technical spec. from the functional, then an implementation plan from the technical. AI asked me numerous times for clarification in areas that, on first pass, I thought were clear, but had more issues than I realized. I do not think I would have gotten to as good of results had I just had the AI write code without planning, but there's nobody to stop me from attempting that. Similarly, being able to build a working prototype in hours, not days, let me realize a lot of other issues much more quickly. There was functionality that sounded good on paper, but, once I got to actually play with it, was no good. This could've been achieved with a no-code solution, but building it with AI got me to effectively the same result without having to learn another tool and then translate designs from that tool into code. All that said, it is practically guaranteed you will reach a point where, despite best efforts, using AI will result in some excess code complexity that might need to be triaged with a learned mind. The bar for when this occurs is certainly being raised as the tooling and methodologies improve, but it's still there. The more strategies you can employ to stave that off the better. reply",

I sent in a tongue‑in‑cheek entry, a batch file that used PKZIP to “compile” code into PKZIP.OBJ (instead of .ZIP) and then ZIP2EXE to “link” it into an EXE. The result was an executable that unzipped itself back into a source file. He was amused enough to mention it near the end of his column, though he noted it didn’t quite qualify for the contest since I hadn’t written PKZIP myself.<p>I found scans of his section on archive.org, including the issue where he announces the contest, but I couldn't find my particular contribution. I've narrowed it down to the eight issues listed above that are in the right time-frame.<p>If you have any of these issues (paper or PDF), could you please check Wilf’s section near the back and see if my submission is mentioned?<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The crew goes out to look at a possible gas leak, a loud plane is heard, the camera pans up, and the North Tower is hit. It was one of three recordings of that hit and the only clear one. The rest of the documentary follows the crew into the towers. No one knows what's going on, the scenes are chaotic but also calm as the firefighters try to figure out what to do. Then the second tower falls while (one of the brothers) is in the first. One of the most incredible things I've ever seen. I think it was well known when it came out, but it's been overshadowed especially since searching \"9/11 documentary\" gives a million results. If you want to see one of the craziest human experiences unfold in front of you, there's no other film like this. reply",

          "text": "My second favorite “Wild, Wild, Country”, but it was mentioned already at the top of the first list.  I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",
