          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "This is very cool. Here is something I'm struggling with as a user. I look at a product (this tofu for example [0]) and see the amounts. And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be? reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

I hope we can agree that we are better off than that now. What I'm curious about is whether you think it's been a steady stream of improvements, and we just need to improve further? Or if you think there was some point between 1900 and now where food health and safety was maximized, greater than either 1900 or now, and we've regressed since then? reply",

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "Those algorithms implement so random to me, with lack of explanation, no test cases, no formal proof, and often inconsistent naming or structure across languages. Many repositories like TheAlgorithms are great collections, but they feel more like code dumps than true learning resources. You can find an implementation of Dijkstra or QuickSort, but often there is no context: why it works, how to prove it correct, what the complexity is, or how to test it against edge cases. For someone who wants to learn algorithms deeply, that missing layer of reasoning and validation is critical. No organization for learners either. It jumps straight into implementations without a logical flow from fundamentals. I want to build something more structured: start from the very foundation (like data structures, recursion, and complexity analysis), then move to classical algorithms (search, sort, graph, dynamic programming), and eventually extend to database internals, optimization, and even machine learning or AI algorithms. Basically, a single consistent roadmap from beginner to researcher level, where every algorithm connects to the next and builds intuition step by step. Another very good resource for beginners is https://www.hello-algo.com . At first, i actually wanted to contribute there, since it explains algorithms visually and in simple language. But it mostly covers the basics and stops before more advanced or applied topics. I want to go deeper and treat algorithms as both code and theory, with mathematical rigor and formal proofs where possible. That is something I really liked about Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and of course The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) by Knuth. They combine reasoning, math, and practice. My goal is to make something in that spirit, but more practical and modern, bridging the gap between academic books and messy open source repos. reply",

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.  And some data visualizations as in Sedgewick's book would also be helpful. reply",

          "text": "Currently working on an open source Heroku / Fly.io / Render alternative: https://canine.sh Its built on top of Kubernetes, based on learnings I've had from previous experiences scaling infrastructure. If you look at the markup PaaS (Heroku, Fly, Render) applies to IaaS (AWS, Hetzner), it's on the order of 5-10x. But not having that, and trying to stitch together random AWS services is a huge PITA for a medium sized engineering team (we've tried). On top of all that, theres a whole host of benefits to being on kubernetes, namely, that you can install any helm package with one click, which Canine also manages. A good example is Sentry -- even though it has an open source offering, almost everyone pays for the cloud version because its too scary to self host. With Canine, its a one click, and you get a sentry.your-domain.com to use for whatever you need. Recently got a sponsorship from the Portainer team to allow me to dedicate way more time to this project, so hugely grateful to them for that. Code: https://github.com/czhu12/canine reply",

Yes, can be expensive computationally that's why the city is so small (for now) but as I start to distribute the simulation into many cores, players with high core CPU will be able to choose a bigger city size :) I agree that individual level simulation is what makes it interesting and I plan to keep it like that. reply",

          "text": "My second favorite “Wild, Wild, Country”, but it was mentioned already at the top of the first list.  I enjoy it as a cautionary tale, but I also unironically find it an inspiring tale of building, even if it turns out to bad. My favorite documentary is “The Barkley Marathons, the race that eats it’s young” I return to it at least once a year, and while the root of the story - watching people attempt the impossible is certainly inspiring, I find its moral themes are what I appreciate about it the most.  The idea of competition as a collective activity, that everyone wants to win, but also everyone wants to see others win their own race, that there’s something about the way that it advances our understanding of humanity that is more important than individual success. Then also - that your race is yours alone, and that the most important victory is the one you define for yourself.  There are people who finish only one or three laps of the five lap marathon, and that failure is a greater achievement than most people will ever know, and they clearly see it that way, there’s near no shame in anyone’s performance and people are clearly defining success for themselves, mostly clearly beyond what anyone else would define it for them.  And finally, it’s kind of a throwaway line, but one of the runners says “I think most people could use more pain in their lives.” And it made me realize that often, when enduring hardship, rather than turning away from it, finding ways to challenge myself on my terms is a healthier approach to stress than “relaxing”. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages. The kind of thing where you could miss a bracket on line 47 but end up with a compiler error complaining about something 20 lines away.

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

I'm seeing a bunch of Samsung, LG, RCA, Sony, etc on Facebook Marketplace. What a cesspool Facebook has become, right?<p>Any suggestions on the best brand or even model for that kind of thing? I don't really want to battle with a bunch of shit that tries to coerce me to install another app from a streaming provider slash gambling entrypoint.<p>I imagine mostly it will just need HDMI to work, and all the TVs will support that.

          "text": "Do recommend the LG C series (C5 or C4 are new or the C1 series if you want a deal on classifieds - same hardware as the higher end models but needs a firmware bit flip). The OS is very rootable and it makes a great TV that doubles as a monitor. Supports free sync / g-sync. OLED is nice at this scale. Text is very readable, refresh rate is good. It uses the same panels as the fancier G series in the larger sizes. One can root the firmware to make it go brighter. (Though this is screen works well in medium or dimly lit rooms. It does not shine in very bright rooms). Plenty of YouTube videos singing the C series praises as a TV / Monitor.[1] LG webOS is also trivial/friendly to root in developer mode and network control of the tv is a nice to have. Would avoid Samsung. I love the matte on the Frame and the design of the Serif but the OS is frustrating / impractical to root. [1] https://youtu.be/Qtve0u3GJ9Y reply",

My \"favorite\" feature is that when I use an app like Netflix and then press the \"Exit\" button on the remote there's a 50% chance I just land back on my desktop and a 50% chance that the menu that covers the bottom third of the screen is open. It can also frequently not find the signal of the computer, maybe 1 in 50 times. Sometimes it'll connect in a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes after replugging the HDMI, and sometimes updating the screen by doing things like pressing buttons that would cause something to change (my computer neither hybernates nor goes to sleep). Not to mention that it frequently will ask me to update the terms of service (I cannot reject them, I can only select \"remind me later\" and it starts to get aggressive) and it will change some settings when it force updates on me.

          "text": "Another +1 for LG but it's worth mentioning that there are a few things that a TV firmware does that you don't necessarily want in a Monitor. Simple example: most TVs will stay on _forever_ with the \"no signal\" image bouncing around... but a proper monitor will interpret that as a sign that the PC has gone to sleep so the monitor should, too. I have not looked into hacking the firmware to change this behavior but if there's a \"custom rom\" out there that can do this, I'd appreciate a link! One of the best things about LG in general is their serial port.\nIt's hit/miss which of their models will have it exposed on the back, but if yours does,  the protocol is well documented and is very simple. My LG TV (used as a monitor) is really chatty on the network and so I keep it disconnected so I don't get periodic interruptions from little overlays telling me that $someApp has been updated and needs me to agree to new terms (yes, really!). To re-gain remote control for automation, I use the serial port. I have an ESP32 connected to a mmWave sensor for active \"at desk?\" detection. This is integrated with Home Assistant which knows which PC my KVM is pointing to and if it's on or not. This lets me re-implement basic \"if not at desk and no PC is on, put the display to sleep\" automation. My biggest complaint is more of an ecosystem issue; why is DisplayPort not common on TVs? Because this TV-As-A-Monitor is HDMI only, my KVM has to be HDMI and so does every PC that's hooked up. Would have been a lot nicer if the whole chain could be display port :/. reply",

          "text": "If you were using a TV streaming stick, many have slow Ethernet due to slow port (Micro-USB), slow PHY hardware (100 mbps) or slow network stack. For the popular streaming apps they only need 25 mbps max, so most stick makers put no effort into design or validation testing beyond that minimal use case. And they don't care about latency. I use Moonlight via direct 1 gbps Ethernet from a high-end gaming PC in the same house through a Google Chromecast 4K HDMI dongle with a powered USB-C hub for the RJ-45 input and it works flawlessly at 60 fps 4K 10-bit HDR with around 12 ms video latency. Some USB 3 hubs and USB Ethernet dongles won't reach full speeds on some streaming devices USB ports. The second one I tried worked at full 1 gbps. You have to verify every software and hardware component in the chain is working at high-speed/low latency in your environment with a local speed test hosted on your source machine. I used self-hosted OpenSpeedTest. Moonlight works great but none of the consumer streaming stick or USB hub/RJ-45 dongles test for high speed/low latency across dozens of different device port hardware/firmware combos - so you can't trust claimed specs. Assume it's slow until you verify it's not. reply",

          "text": "This is correct and the general sentiment and experience among professionals. Starting in late 2022, there's been a coordinated assault on industry by AI, both in terms of false marketing (execs thinking they can replace all their workers), and in terms of torturous interference (ghost candidates/ghost jobs) imposing cost on all candidates (and business alike). It has demonstrated a number of important things some which are just bad for industry in the long-run like the resilience built-in to architecture by competent people may have been ill-thought out. People used to automate away the boring stuff, but when that boring stuff doesn't break for 2 years because of design, they can just let you go for that time. They lose out the value of becoming leaner, and coping with emergencies but few people after this are setting up fully resilient architecture. You can't pay enough for the demonstrated downside. There's been a critical loss of credibility on the industry by these actions. I would reiterate and corroborate that LinkedIn and Indeed are worthless for hiring. They do not curate the people they allow to advertise for jobs. There are many fake company spinoffs for non-existent roles that use the personalized CV data for something else. These fake companies lead you on, use AI to eat up your time, and often fail a more thorough background check into public records using OSINT. (i.e. quite a number have owners who were in obituaries with paperwork filed after their deaths). For real data, the average cold-submit of CV to interview ratio has been around 1:1200 for LI/Indeed. These have been custom tailored for the positions, for an individual with a decade of experience as an expert generalist (Linux & Windows Ecosystems both on-prem and Cloud-tenant based), with deep expertise in helpdesk at all SLA tier levels, System/Network Admin roles/Principal Engineer, and DevOps/Architect roles. Unable to find work in two years of massive unrelenting week-by-week effort, a good number of competent techies are now retraining. The brain drain on industry caused by this is massive and shouldn't be overlooked but appears to be. Some might think to say this is just a bad economy. Tech has never been correlated with the driving factors of the economy. Interest rate increases, and financial crises have come and gone in the past with no observable change in tech. This is a disruption-based economy, and its unhinged. This appears to be purely the work of factor market manipulation by oligopoly, to glut the factor market and stall the economy for profit. The same things that happen when you fire your people, raise prises, and lower production which often ends in a vicious doom cycle since lack of money in circulation lowers the amount of customers, which drives more firing in deflationary spirals which are common under regimes of money-printing given sufficient time. reply",

For me Dragon was pretty much unusable without expensive microphone setup. And even then, it needed constant intervention for punctuation and formatting. Here's an example of what I mean. In these tests, I just spoke the words, I did not dictate any punctuation. Mistakes annotated by ~ VoiceBuddy (with microphone built into my cheap Logitech Webcam):\nThe color of animals is by no means a matter of choice. It depends on many considerations, but in the majority of the cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there are to be but few brightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are themselves protective.

          "text": "I am a lead software engineer with 12 years of experience and a recent master's degree in cybersecurity. I use GitHub CoPilot everyday. I usually limit it to a fancy auto-complete. It's really helpful for repetitive refactor tasks, I just have to go to each line and it updates. This way I still see what's happening, but it is faster than manually making those changes that can't be solved with a find and replace. Sometimes I fight CoPilot because it will continue to suggest something I do not want to do. In those instances I code faster as to outpace the AI's latency. Other devs are building MCP servers to help access our tools for AI integration. Devops seems heavy on spec driven and test driven development through AI. The spec driven development looks interesting, but a bit of overhead to get started. Our company has an AI first directive right now where we're supposed to use AI for everything and see what works. I somewhat disdain it, but it's also fun to have a directive to try new things indiscriminately (using AI). The more I drink the Kool aid, the better it tastes. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had discussed this on here for like 7-8 days ago but I can't get to know the reason why. I have thought about it for hours, thinking I have finally understood the reason why, but it seems that the only thing I know is that I know nothing.<p>My question is simple. Why are people uneducated about foss and how to really change that.<p>I have thought about what might be the best way to spread the word about foss and it seems that the best way is via advocating things like f-droid and linux mate/flatpak/ making things so simple that there is no reason why not.<p>Yet then I think that the reason why people are still not interested is that it becomes <i>too</i> boring.<p>Am I really in control if all my moves are being tracked. I am not sure. Do people not know this?<p>I want to raise awareness about oss since its something I am passionate about. Yet I can't seem to know how. I feel heard talking about these issues, its so easy convincing people sometimes to use signal yet they still don't have it. Its mixed bag.<p>I feel like my generation has left me a lot more too, we have stopped even questioning it and we are all so polarized by algorithms tracking us all.<p>I feel like in a world of such polarization, using open source can help to slowly raise awareness about it so that we can then move away from extreme privacy invasise ragebaits inducing algorithms to something better, so that then we can lessen our senses and stop with oh its the end of all and nothing matters nihilism or yeah who cares kind of idea.<p>Sometimes I feel like my ideas don't matter, maybe you could say things like youtube are a mic for people like my ideas but its not. I don't want to create any lore about me, I just want to tell people about stupid simple foss things like f-droid and leave in my opinion so that I could then work on/help other pressing issues in open source.<p>People also feel entitled to good quality open source software, like if that's what you expect, either be so kind to thank the developer and kindly ask them an solution or join their community and kindly ask there or maybe donate to them/contribute to it yourselves. I see people who are entitled and its :/<p>I thank every open source developer, its like something so elegant to me, we can have forks and so many other things and we all learn from each other and its sometimes refreshing. Yet it saddens me that it doesn't receive donations, that people don't use it, that people feel entitled sometimes asking for a feature.<p>This rabbit hole is so deep but if we want to share it with the masses, then we need to discuss the priorities of what to share and what not to for begineers. We need a genuine wiki to get started into the open source lifestyle. I don't know how I started, maybe by just using linux and then searching for any software and writing alternativeto X open source something and so many other things...<p>Awesome-privacy helped me out a ton in the beginning as well. I actually read it whole and privacyguides.net and so many others, there are so many good guides yet they still don't get attention.<p>So should people create another guide to split the attention even more or should they actually redirect attention to lists which we might discuss is good enough for everyone. I have so many questions.<p>We can have better things and that gives me hope. But the problem is that, it doesn't require myself to change but the world in the process a little as well and that confuses me.<p>Do I have the power to change the world in this direction or not? Do any one of us have it? I feel small in this system yet I know giving hope would be mixed too. I don't want to be sad for something out of my control, but that is the question, is this thing out of our control or not? \nI feel like I don't know its answer. \nI just don't know which is why I am asking here. But I still want to be hopeful y'know.<p>Have a nice day and looking forward to each and every one of your comments!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I wake up in the morning, get on my iPhone that synced all of its data to iCloud so if it falls in the river tomorrow, I pick up another one and keep moving. I talk to my wife about our budget while we are making changes on our individual phones that are synced in real time on Google Sheets. I walk over to my home office and open my MacBook Pro with 16 hours battery life that runs silent.  I put on my AirPods Pro that magically pair to all six of my devices and switch between them. I log onto Slack to check the various groups and then use Zoom and Gong that transcribes and summarizes the call using an LLM. I then might use Google’s NotebookLM to consolidate all of the transcripts and documentation to summarize and to ask questions. True I use VSCode that might be open source and has some propriety bits.  I then launch Docker Desktop and start doing some coding depending on the day of the week along with some type of AI coding assistant. Of course there are all of the SaaS apps that I use during the day - Salesforce, Notion, GSuite, Rippling (a YC company), etc. Tell me how is open source going to make my life better where I am not using it? Of course I know Node, Python, the underpinnings of MacOS etc are open source. I am “educated on open source”.  Why would I want to make my life harder or why would a company want to make their life harder by caring about a philosophy?  My goal and the company I work for want to make their life as easy as possible. None of what you said is a convincing argument. reply",

          "text": "Hey, appreciate your response! Now, my hn post was actually longer than 4000 and that's why I had to trim otherwise I would've had maybe explained the question but I will try to write a short answer in here. > Why should they care? What does open source give you? Open source gives people complete freedom, the freedom that a software can run for posterity, can be modified towards your liking, and the most important thing which I failed to mention: peace of mind Most open source software can be run with peace of mind. No subscriptions. No update that enshittens it. If it works and you like it, its yours. No spying on you. No showing you ads which will try to radicalize you or sell you some scammy course as an example. Its just there... saying hi to you, saying how's your day, oh you want to use me, fine, how can I help you today. And it expects nothing back in return. Its just there waiting to be used. People should care because of this, for peace of mind. its almost always worth it in my opinion. I genuinely think that although I didn't mention but even small steps like using f-droid and then transitioning to linux to then transition to mastodon/bluesky as an example can definitely help reducing the reliance on algorithms as well, it can stop spying on us via using things like signal. I'd recommend you to check out the clippy movement by louis rousman. I sort of resonate with the same statement and I agree with the right to repair as well, sure I am not much of a hardware tinkering person but the fact that I can go to a mechanic who can repair easily or have an ability to learn it myself via repair friendly systems is always nice to have and I agree with that thing too. I hope that the clippy movement can sort of bring both the things together which I think it already does. Clippy movement is great actually & explains the reason why people should care, but I have also tried to give some of my own rationale behind it as well. Personally, the reason I got into open source was because of privacy. I started learning more and more about privacy and uh, the final straw on the camel's back for me was when I learnt valorant was installed kernel level and there's no way you can 100% guarantee its removed without deleting the whole system. Downloaded linux and kind of never moved back and got into a rabbit hole. (The only time I used windows was in a vm/winboat app to run a tool which could root my phone but that company's otp server didn't work or anything and so my phone can't be rooted but yeah:<) I like linux but I think that there are so many low hanging fruits like f-droid and signal that people don't even use them man. I would talk about linux/cli tools then when people show the initiative of having f-droid/signal. I think that we need to first educate people about these tools because they are genuinely better than their alternatives and just so good that its almost always worth it to have them on your phone/systems reply",

The community (which is often part of the sales pitch) is a minefield to navigate, you have to put in the time to understand the ideology or face its wrath. The general drama of OSS.

What if I told ya that facebook allegedly detected when teen girls deleted selfies so it could serve them beauty ads. Did you know that? Do most population know how deeply privacy invasive ads are. Yes, we might be vocal about it but that's because we care. We care enough for the world to not want it to be a privacy nightmare dystopia and we are advocating it in ways we can take action in. There are people on the political side of things too which are taking action on stronger regulation but I deeply think that politics is so bundled with corruption all across the world that instead of us relying on politics to fix these companies, we need to use open source/stop watching closed algorithmic things and use things like mastodon to slowly get more normal so that we can then discuss things and fix politics/politicians to remove corruption. How can we do this if the world has created a divide between two parties all across the world and its only fueled by the proprietory algorithmic worlds? How can people care about it if they can't even care about open source in general. I think that if people care about open source/privacy it can be gateway to a better future for us all & this is why we share it. > If you want to change people you have to be willing to be changed by them. Like, okay but we change people through logic and reasoning and discussion. Everyone gets changed by a good discussion, you take in more perspectives, I took from this conversation that open source is a chicken and egg problem. People want good UI/UX and support but how many people donate to open source so that either it can get to that state or just have more people willing to open source instead of making yet another saas... not many Now, that being said, we can reason about things, maybe I can convince you, maybe not. I just believe this notion to be a little anti-scientific really in the sense, that the mere idea of me wanting to change them shouldn't make me change myself, but that I am always willing to be changed if they can provide reason but from a bird's eye view, I am pretty comfortable that my logic doesn't have much gaps, I have thought about it for atleast a month straight. But I am more than willing to correct myself but the way you word it makes me feel like you want me to change more than be willing to change yourself as well and you might feel the same for me but we are both so convinced by two different realities that we live in. But if you put that aside and genuinely just want a discussion, not wanting to change me or change you but this notion of should we even change people or how can we change people, I am more than willing to discuss. And also maybe change isn't that bad after all :) reply",

Now they can install termux and then go be one of us but then again not gui/cognitive load. So there is f-droid. Also, its not that hard finding some genuinely cool foss stuff I wanted a pdf reader on android and I searched open source pdf editor and tried 2-3 and some had poor UX and UI but then I found MJPdf (as an example) https://github.com/mudlej/mj_pdf/ and I found it to be the most superior UI/UX I have seen for a pdf editor. Same goes for my browser. Zen-browser has the best UI/UX for browser based system. Its just so cool. I love it with Ublock origin. I can give you some software I can personally vouch for the good UI/UX and compile a list but would that really matter? I just thought of this idea, also another idea for a good gui is that its kind of hard and requires a language like dart/kotlin which I am not familiar with/ don't actively like (I haven't tried them) I want to make good android apps in golang but I know I sort of can't make it or its a bunch of hacks/(not worth it?) but there are apps which do that too. Also I am not sure how you can have marketing for open source apps when the devs sometimes if the app is a service run them at a loss financially and invest their time into it. If we can't expect donations to be made to them, I don't think we can expect this as well, can we? The incentives system for foss is broken imo but I am not sure how changing it can happen. reply",

Let's leave aside for the moment that pretty much all (with a few notable exceptions), OSS software compares terribly to commercial software.

When an objective person, 97% of whom have never seen a command line interface, or actually installed ANY OS ever take one look and see a big pile of pre-fan supplements. I say this as someone who makes use of OSS software every day. There is outstanding OSS software available. I could list many great nuggets. Categorizing software as good or bad based on the license is probably the least useful way to do it. All licenses, commercial or open, cover software that's mostly rubbish, with occasional good offerings. You may as well evangelize red cars as being better than blue cars.

People care about the license because if the license is, let's say source available and a commercial license on the side, then the problem is that the software stops being permanent and relies on that company. Why so? Because if the company let's say enshittens the project in one version, and the community starts using the last version that wasn't enshittened, they inevitably lose out on bug fixes / qol updates etc. now you might say that people should fork it. But nobody really likes forking a repository with source available license either because of the license or because the company itself would benefit more from the code updates that they write and use it themselves or sell their version as well due to the commerical offerings or the dev's would simply be less willing to due to all of such things. I am not a license purist. I like https://anticapitalist.software/ (Acap license) the most, its because I don't like some commercial usage which would've just taken my labour for it is and not donate to me if I write some software In general, the ACSL is a good match for software that would have otherwise been permissively licensed under MIT, ISC, or BSD but with restrictions against corporate usage.\nHere is an excerpt from ACSL: The ACSL is right for you if you want your code to empower students, artists, hobbyists, collectives, cooperatives and nonprofits to survive under capitalism while not contributing free labor to corporations. The ACSL is right for you if you reject the status quo, believe better things are possible, and want to act on your beliefs. The ACSL is right for you if you carry a new world in your heart, and in your code. That being said, I don't mind licenses that much, source available can be fine too for a peace of mind at-least. If there is any source available license which requires a one time license or something,I think its okay. So I am not sure how somebody is selling the license. The license is a little important, but the battle is against proprietory vs source-code available. The battle is between complete black box vs something you can look inside and have peace of mind. reply",

The result of data harvesting is not a breach. but the whole system that it is right now, for all such data harvesting imo, the most common fraction seems to be hate which gets the most engagement which is why to me most social media feels hateful off the start and why its linked to some of the issues we have right now. Its definitely escalated. There are some genuine problems in economies all around the world yet if those nations leaders try to scapegoat, trying to create a us vs them, its not a good fix and shit might break and we would all be too invested in watching yt shorts. What I am advocating with foss is also federation/curated social media with no algorithms but that is the step two imo. The step one to mass adoption for such things might be to have people more familiar/comfortable with open source. Overall, we need to fight on both fronts if we want change. Both algorithmic and open source apps based. Some open source apps are predatory, they will charge you recurring and hope you forget. Some cheap/quickly built games which can be open source for android for all purposes aren't open source right now and they exploit children's lack of financial knowledge in that sense(scams of sorts). I think people will create 10$ subscriptions to a local text editor in this world. I just wish instead of people spending those 10$ there or somewhere else, why can't we donate to open source as a society so that the software can be more complete/helpful to even more people and so on and so on...

Years pass and some simple things that are a no-brainer in Photoshop are still a nightmare to do in GIMP. Text stroke is one of such examples, there's no easy way to do it with GIMP and the method you can see online looks bad and can't be easily changed afterwards. Why? Or something as simple as picking a size of a brush - why is selecting small sizes such a pain while selecting gigantic brushes that hardly anyone uses is not? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Desktop Linux is an another example. It's always presented as an alternative to Windows (or even better than Windows) and when someone tries it out and it doesn't work for them the end user gets blamed for using the wrong distribution, having wrong hardware, not being able to solve issues right away despite being a beginner or even hit with the legendary \"works on my machine\". It's always the user who is in the wrong and never the software. All of this gives OSS a bad name. There are always a bunch of small, annoying problems that affects end users and which often go unfixed for years. Whenever one of these end users brings up these problems they either get told to use a bizarre workaround or get a snarky response about submitting a PR or something. This kind of contempt towards the end user seems to be surprisingly common in OSS circles. I don't think this is fixable.

Main Street is not really any better at seeing through hype cycles than anyone else, but they are less up-to-date on what is currently hyped, and they also are more likely to think that they hired the programmer to make technical decisions, rather than wanting to make those technical decisions themselves.  They have other (often equally technical) decisions to concentrate on, in different areas, so they are wanting you to just Make It Work. The downside is they are unimpressed with refactoring, updating to new versions, and the like.  The upside is they are ok with you using boring technology that works, even at times when a VC-backed tech company would insist on something new and overcomplicated. Also, the pay is ok, but honestly it's not going to be as high as in VC-backed employers. reply",

Leaving corporate tech jobs is already a big enough hit to TC. Getting out of VC-funded tech very often means a dramatic change in life style. The VC world might be insane, but so is the comp. It's not just the money. The biggest thing I've notice in my career is that, as a general rule, employers value you (or any resource for that matter) in proportion to how much they pay for you. Often people have the illusion that getting paid $80k a year when you used to make $300k will mean that your employer will recognize that you are a tremendous value. They won't. they'll see you and treat you as a low tier worker that can easily be replaced, has timed breaks and 30 minutes for lunch. reply",

I’ve worked at only one startup. We IPO’d. I did pretty good and I joined a unicorn at like series B. Enough to go a decade figuring out what I want to work on next. Most of my other friends went to work at other startups. Most of them went bust and they made nothing but their base salary (and a couple of them got screwed on that too). So unless someone’s working at an actual unicorn like I was it’s really no guarantee. FWIW I made 8x on my latest shares, and multiples on that on earliest. Some people I know who had been there a few years more than me walked away with many more Ms which ain’t bad for 6-8 years of work. But that is SUPER lucky. It has sort of ruined my outlook too because I have no interest making 250k base + 200k RSUs, and I have zero interest in most of these current startups that I have a good hunch will not work out. And 400k isn’t that meaningful anymore, I’d rather live off interest or work as a barista if my own startup doesn’t work out. reply",

          "text": "These are mutually exclusive states, actually. The \"chance at making FU money\" and \"100% more work/stress\" and \"losing funding or... goes bust and can't make payroll\", that's stuff that happens at startups that are paying _below_ the VC-backed market rate. Once a company gets money to be paying employees in the third hump of the trimodal distribution of SWE pay, those \"exciting\" parts are long gone. You're no longer in the running to receive a hilarious amount of money should everything 10-100x, and you're no longer worried about going bust and not making payroll. Even a pre-series A startup I worked at saw the writing on the wall with 5 months of runway left and switched from trying to get funded to finding an M&A deal. At the very least you can get the team acquired by someone in the expansion phase and get the rare chance to interview as a group and compare notes and have an exec try and negotiate your salary _up_ for once. By the time a startup is paying VC-backed market rate, the level of stress you have just comes from the usual suspects: management, culture toxicity, etc. some of that you can absorb, some might prompt you to find a new job, just like normal. There's still a level of \"hoo-rah, we're a startup\" present of course, but I just consider this a bad attempt to keep the magic of when the company and products were small alive. I let it affect me none. reply",

If they had to pay a lot extra for you, the wisdom goes, they will imagine that you must have been worth it, and will take you more seriously. If they paid bargain basement price for you, well, I suppose the same psychology applies. (I was reminded of this folk wisdom last week, by a couple hints in an interview.  It's a bit tricky to filter out startup employers who only want midrange commodity skillsets, when you're willing to take a lower salary in exchange for meaningful equity.  While many of them are thinking of workers as generic commodities (and necessary evils, to the real stars who are the founders), and valuing these hires based on salary they are willing to entertain.) reply",

I see so much opportunity for a small medium business consultation in the analytics and process space but these companies are like really strapped for money and largely set in their ways in my experience. In my experience, people are open to solving their problems. It’s just the money is hard making it financially viable so it’s just the big money is just like an order of magnitude smaller. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I think the general level of sort of like process thinking and data driven decision making in tech is at just like a higher baseline than on Main Street A lot of my discussions are challenging how to sort of like present the problem in a way that somebody that doesn’t have decades of experience and operations understands. Another challenge that I face regularly with Main Street companies is just people seem to be happy like they’re not trying to continuously optimize like I’m used to doing coming for a big tech. Even when it’s easy to present like positive ROI opportunities there’s just like a comfort with the way things are done and a lot of people seem just happy governed by their scaling factors in exchange for that that comfort. TLDR; challenges are financial and mentality. reply",

Normally too early for VC, and often very shiny thing, or polishing things expected to be shiny in the future. I've only once worked on main street when I was managing the app for a pizza chain. One day, sitting in a quarterly planning meeting for the pizza company, they were discussing changes they could make to the app and the comment that stood out in my head was \"we forecast this change could help us sell x% more garlic bread\". In my head I thought, \"I don't care how much garlic bread we sell...this is not why I'm on the planet\". I know not every mains st. business is selling pizza, and lots of B2B companies, VC backed or not, would not excite me. You're right, helping investors make money isn't very compelling, and I think B2B, has that kind of focus, but many ventures aren't B2B SaaS.
