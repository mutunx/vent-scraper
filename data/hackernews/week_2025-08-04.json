      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Project URL: https://github.com/debba/rewindtty<p>I've been working on rewindtty, a lightweight terminal session recorder and replayer written in C. It works like script/scriptreplay, but outputs structured JSON and includes a browser-based player for replaying terminal sessions with timing, scrubbing, bookmarks, and more.<p>Until now, I was recording sessions command-by-command, capturing each shell command and its output separately. That made it easy to analyze sessions and index them by command.<p>However, I just introduced a new interactive mode, which behaves more like traditional script: it records raw terminal I/O in real-time via a PTY, capturing every character typed or displayed, including control sequences.<p>This is great for realism and full session fidelity (e.g. interactive tools like htop, vim, REPLs), but it makes command detection much harder — I'm no longer intercepting input at the shell level.<p>My question is: how can I extract actual commands from this raw PTY stream?<p>I'm aware it's tricky, but I'm wondering:<p><pre><code>    Has anyone tried parsing the ANSI stream to reconstruct command boundaries?\n\n    Is it possible to hook into the shell (bash, zsh, etc.) in real-time to intercept commands?\n\n    Are there shell options or audit features that can be leveraged in parallel to raw capture?\n\n    Any prior art or libraries I should look at?\n</code></pre>\nI'd love to hear how others have approached this — either for recording, analyzing, or replaying shell sessions. Any insights or directions would be super helpful.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Email: nathaniel.bennett@gmail.com My name is Nate Bennett. I reside Thousand Oaks, Ca with my beautiful wife of almost 15yrs and 3 children. I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs. As a former professional athlete, I am looking to join a team where teamwork is paramount and opportunities for growth and learning from others are a daily occurrence. I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding. Away from the computer I enjoy working out in my garage gym, playing guitar, and playing with my kids. reply",

Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual. I am always looking to improve not only myself but also my work. reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking.

I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

My goal is always to solve the problem and make sure people know there’s a solution. In my next role, I'm looking to work with a team that values clarity and impact. I'm especially interested in data heavy environments where thoughtful tooling can make workflows better. Most recently, I built [Buckaroo]( https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo ) an open source data table for Jupyter using Pandas/Polars. It combines fast rendering, summary stats, and a low-code UI.

We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants. We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA. We’re a growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments. We’re looking for an engineer whose focus will be on using data to improve our bot detection and protection. Telling apart bots from genuine users is vital to our product. If possible, we prefer to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word even?) - choosing an if/else rule over a neural network. Good knowledge of the web is always useful in this company. At our scale we are looking for generalists more than specialists. Our engineering team is fully remote across Europe, we meet up in person a few times per year. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, fully remote or (partially) from our Munich office. Please note that we ONLY consider candidates located within the EU/UK/EEA/Switzerland.

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you've ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let's talk: info@fusionbox.com. reply",

About Solace: The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. We're a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces...

We're building voice AI for large contact centers. Everyone thinks contact centers are boring. They're wrong. It's the last place where companies actually talk to their customers. We listen to calls every week and it's fascinating. AI here actually helps real people: shorter wait times, 24/7 support, lower cost. Stellar skips the robotic text-to-speech pipeline entirely and works directly with voice. Our conversations are remarkably human, also in non-English languages and local dialects, where most AI sounds like a bad GPS navigator. \nOn top of this, we're great at integrating with the complex systems at enterprises, and meeting their compliance requirements. We're cash-flow positive, growing fast with enterprise clients queuing up, and all founders still code. We need engineers who can jump between our Go and TS backends and React frontend. This role is perfect if you: * Want massive ownership at a small team (not pretend \"impact\" at BigCo) * Actually enjoy solving hard problems (real-time audio at enterprise scale) * Think making AI sound human in niche dialects is a fun challenge Find the full vacancy here: https://www.stellarcs.ai/careers/software-engineer EU work authorization is required.

          "text": "Windows ME was bad, but not due to anything specific they did with ME. Between Windows 95, 98, 98 SE, and then ME the hardware landscape absolutely exploded (e.g. tens of new categories of devices). Which meant more third party drivers than ever before. Drivers ran in the same address space as the kernel, without isolation, and BY DESIGN would monkey-patch the kernel (with different drivers sometimes stepping on one another). This was already a problem in 98/98 SE, but the whole thing just crumbled under its own weight around the time of ME. 2000/XP by contrast had strict user mode/kernel mode isolation, processes had their own virtual memory, and kernel address space was protected (making monkey-patching more difficult). In XP in particular they also started to adopt Driver Signature Enforcement, which at that time brought a cultural rather than technical shift (i.e. everyone knew it would eventually be mandatory, and so started to tighten processes). Vista then made things even better with Mandatory Driver Signing (64-bit), PatchGuard + ASLR (i.e. no more monkey-patching the kernel), Code Integrity Checks (corruption detection), WDDM for more stable graphics drivers, and shifted some other drivers to user mode (soft failures instead of BSODs). The official sales pitch of ME over 98 SE was: System Restore (new), System File Protection (technically ported from 2K, but new for the 9x line), faster boot (due to real-mode DOS being removed), Automatic Updates, Movie Maker, and improved home networking. It was a big upgrade for people coming from 98 and still a minor upgrade from 98 SE (which a lot of people skipped, even though it was a substantial improvement for just $20 upgrade cost). PS - Vista moving to WDDM for graphics drivers, which everyone takes for granted today, is much of the reason why it was SO poorly received upon released. Vendors moved both to WDDM and in some cases to x64 for the first time, and it was a buggy mess there for at least a year -- which was blamed on Vista. reply",

Development of complex utilities from video editing to web browsers being more than just HTML viewers and fighting over limited memory trying to manage a high stack of rapidly more complex drivers and ME just didn't handle it that greatly. The modem, printer, high end GPU's and audio systems all fighting to work together. It just seems like the whole Windows system pre-NT was struggling to stay together. Cue the famous Win 98 demonstration crashing the system via a Plug and play scanner. Win 98 SE was in a bizarre stable state, ME wasn't and the differences under the hood could have been something that appeared fairly minor. reply",

I have money saved up, don’t live an extravagant lifestyle, and have around 7 years of experience but I do know how challenging the job market has been which worries me. I would also be leaving my current company towards the end of the year when not many people are hiring.<p>When asking my friends and colleagues what to do, I always get the same answer of either wait until you find something else to quit or wait until they fire you, but whatever you do don’t leave with no offer in hand.<p>I agree with their approach in general but I’m just really burned out and don’t have the mental energy to come home from a 10 hour day and start preparing for interviews. Ideally I would like time to prepare adequately for interviews and really think about what I want to do next instead of just taking the next thing I’m offered because I’m so desperate to leave my current position.<p>I’m at a point in my life where I don’t want to sacrifice my mental health just to get the next paycheck, but maybe I’m being foolish and just need to get through it.<p>Has anyone navigated a situation like this before?</p></p></p></p></div>",

It’ll feel great at first not having to work but you’ll be spending money without bringing anything in and sooner or later you’ll be needing to find a job in an unforgiving job market. I would listen to your friends, stick it out until you find another job. In the mean time, try to make some changes like not working 10 hour days, maybe take a short leave of absence, etc… but quitting your job and not having another one lined up is almost always a mistake unless you a very large sum of money saved up or some other source of income.

Hackerrank is fast going out the window. Every company that wants to raise money needs to be an AI company so they're not going to tell you not to use AI during the interview. You can screenshot questions, paste it into a deprecated AI model, and it'll spit out the exact answer. Using the AI tools if you haven't might also get you your next job.

          "text": "I’ve done that right before the market downshift in 2023. I’ve spent 3 months doing nothing, travelled to a bunch of cities that I’ve never been to, did tons of works in my own projects (both open and closed source), and actually managed to launch one that is still going. Honestly, this in-between period was one of the most personally rewarding times I’ve ever had in my career, I was feeling great, I was waking up in the morning and coding for a hour before I even had coffee, I had good humor for such a long stretch of time that even people I don’t talk to daily started to notice. But, despite that, actually looking for a new job was soul crushing. I had a spreadsheet to track applications, and the rows just kept piling up, interviews were not happening, when they were happening I got ghosted dozens of times, when I didn’t get ghosted, the code interviews were absolutely ridiculous is all sorts of ways, even I passed code testings companies paused hirings, when I finally got to the last step they’d say culture didn’t align. I got a job after 7 months and 137 applications. It was TERRIBLE, the feeling of hopelessness, the feeling that there is no future, the feeling that your entire 20+ year career is useless and the fear you’ll never find a job again. I don’t wish that on anyone. In the end there are bills to be paid, and you can’t stay unemployed forever, so the reality means you have to thread this carefully. It sounds counterproductive and it is hard, but concentrate less on work, spend time doing things you want, and do not go out for interviews just yet. On top of having a shitty job, you’ll also have shitty evenings because you’ll get to this same soul crushing realization of mine. Do the minimum acceptable at work, cut hours, take vacation, whatever that keeps you employed, and spend any energy you have left doing things you want. Workout, that pet project that hadn’t seen any love, binging Netflix, whatever you mind tells you to do. As long as it doesn’t get worse than it is, it is a win. You are going to leave the company anyway (either voluntarily or not), might as well stockpile some money if you can. The goal is to get better _despite_ the shitty job, to improve yourself while you are still getting paid. Also important: go looking for social support, like lunch with friends and old coworkers, therapy, some meetups on subjects you have interest, whatever you can to talk to people. Mildly venting off helps, just make sure to not overdo and also listen. reply",

As such, I've had a similar experience to yours so far. I've been travelling and volunteering around the world, I'm also back to coding as a hobby again, and also working on other projects like robots, rc planes, and welding. Also exercising. I'm just living the life I actually want. And so fortunate to be able to live it with my partner. This break, like for you, has been one of the most rewarding things ever in my entire life. On the days I really get to experience the spice life one way or another, I feel as much if not more accomplished than I ever did even shipping the largest projects. I also try to remind myself every day to be grateful for the opportunity to pause my career as it is such a gift. I believe gratitude is critical for staying grounded as the person I want to be. But it is also countered by the soul crushing job hunt. I haven't been fully focused on finding a job yet, but I have applied to many interesting opportunities already and not getting responses from these companies, despite me believing I have a somewhat strong resume, puts a pit in my stomach for the reasons you stated so well: questioning my own competence, and worrying about the future. That said, the positives have been so huge, though, that I have to at least try to recommend a break like this to people who feel burnout, especially if they are burnt out yet again. I would urge anyone to always be evaluating what is really important in your life and work towards that as an alternative to working to the bone for promotion and bonuses because we think we should. I wish we all could take the breaks our brains deserve, yet we have to do what we have to do. As one final thought, I will say that soon after quitting my job for this adventure, I was already feeling refreshed and better, and to anyone reading this, your life is worth more than money. reply",

Unfortunately, most people’s reality force them to consider money. Someone else mentioned to triple your estimate of how long you might be without a job, and sometimes not even that is enough. In the end, it’s mostly about your safety nets. Can you quit, stay 6 months away, and if it turns into 18 months, what then? Can you move back into your parents’? Are you _realistically_ able to take a non-dev job (cashier at McDonalds) just to put food on the table? Nowadays, affording a decent life AND the job not sucking is almost a luxury already.

Questions you need to answer before quitting: 1) is there anything they can do to keep you - you need to be prepared to answer this, not emotionally but with logic and your sanity in mind 2) is your resume ready?  If not when will it be ready. 3) how do you answer the question: Why did you leave?  The simple answer of 'They were toxic' sounds too much like BS.  It could be interpreted as you are toxic and not willing to see your own problems. 4) are you able to spend 6 months to a year unemployed?  Can you cover all expenses. Including medical. 5) if you are out of work long term, how do you explain what you have been doing?  Best answers are: learning new stuff (with details, possibly a degree), volunteering.  Worst answers: finding yourself, just relaxing, doom scrolling youtube. 6) if you have unemployed friends, set up a group.  See question here where someone was asking how to handle long term unemployment. 7) What are your criteria for the next job.  Clearly not toxic but how are you going to ensure that does not happen.

And can you deal with the salary hit (you'll very likely get a new job with a much lower salary)? I quit a few weeks ago – I was being pushed out. It was not fun. I'm still processing how much psychological warfare was really going on and how much I was being gaslit. I was going to do some travelling but I can't stop looking at my budgeting spreadsheet. But luckily it's summer and where I live is quite nice. I'm still in recovery mode. Some health issues have already resolved themselves. I've lost ~8 pounds. I'm sleeping better. What is keeping me sane is that I knew the job, the environment, my colleagues etc was seriously not working and I would have got fired anyway. Luckily my family can help me out a little bit each month, and I'm thinking of getting a housemate, both of which will reduce my burn rate massively. I have enjoyed re-evaluating my spending. It was a bit out of control. I was getting fat eating too much expensive food/takeout etc. I'm cooking more. It feels weird being away from the computer. I feel like I should be learning more AI/interview prep etc. Like every moment not doing that is further damaging my future. Ugh. But I've also massively lost my love for tech. I need to find out if I can rediscover it I wish I had watched a lot more Jordan Peterson etc a year ago. He touches a lot on having a plan, not just giving up, really contemplating the future, explaining poverty isn't fun, analytically working backwards from your problems etc. It's like the advice my father might have given me if I had one. I think I have mental health issues that affected my work, rather than my job being the sole source of all my mental health issues. Ultimately it really is trading one set of stresses and issues for another, I feel. reply",

These are both excellent ways to reduce your living expenses, particularly spreading the cost of housing + utilities over two or more people by sharing a house or an apartment.  Also a great way to boost your savings rate when you start making an income again. reply",

          "text": "In my case, it was a mistake. It's very tempting because (I'm guessing) you just want to get out of your current situation ASAP, and of course the final decision is still yours, but this is the advice I would give my past self: - You might not be in the best state of mind right now to make a good decision. I agree with others saying you should take time off, the more the better. Definitely more than one week. - Try going for 1-2 months of time off if possible, even if unpaid. If your country has something like \"leave of absence\" that allows you to take a long period off, like 6 months or more (usually unpaid), but still be able to come back to your company after that period (or at least get priority during hires for the similar position), then try to look into that first, and consider it a \"trial period\" of how well your job search will go. - You might feel good about leaving your job for the first few months, but after that you're running on a time limit. This will be on the back of your mind, and you'll have to learn to live with this worry, and not let it affect your performance on interviews. - You'll get rejected. You'll get ghosted. You might think it's you, and part of it will be because of you, but you don't know which rejections are legit and which ones were just farming your info. This will also take a toll on you, and you will have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. - The more time you've been unemployed, the larger the gap on your resume, the better you'll have to be at explaining that gap in a convincing way. And this is without letting the previous point affect your performance on interviews. - Remember that when you apply for roles, when you reach the last stage (the vibe check), you'll be competing against people with no gap, who might be able to perform better than you if only because they have less worries (no ever-increasing gap, no ever-decreasing money, a rejection for them doesn't affect them too much because they still have a job). - Even if you think you have a good network that could help you get a job quickly, consider their location. Assume you'll only be able to get some help from contacts in your current location (within commute time). Even if you're looking for remote jobs, assume your network will only be able to help, at most, with on-site jobs. - Even if you do freelance work, consider those as part of your employment gap. You might get interviews for companies that don't mind it, but assume that most companies default to treating it as an employment gap. - If you feel bad right now at work, assume that's similar to how bad you'll feel after being unable to get a job for 1 year, but with less money on top of that. And you'll have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. --- That's what I would have liked someone told me before I left my last full-time job. I'm aware I'm just some stranger on the internet exposing how much I suck at life because I wasn't able to just get a job quickly like others, and I underestimated a lot of shit. So I think what I want to say is, \"think carefully\". reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Dear all,<p>I learned some basic ML from Andrew Ng's Coursera course more than 10 years ago, recently I graduated from the Math Master program and have some free time in my hand, so I am thinking about picking up ML/DL again.<p>In [Yacine's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6PIchDOcQ), he mentioned [fast.ai's course](https://course.fast.ai/), which I heard of in the past but didn't look into too much. The table of contents of [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) looks pretty solid, but it was published in 2020, so I was wondering given the pace of AI development, do you think this book or course series is still a good choice and relevant for today's learners?<p>*To provide more context about me*: I did math major and CS minor (with Python background) during undergrad but have never taken any ML/DL courses (other than that Coursera one), and I just finished the Master program in math, though I have background and always have interests in graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.<p>I have two books \"Hands-on Machine Learning\" by Geron and \"Hands-on LLMs\" by Alammar and Grootendorst, and plan to finish Stanford's CS224N and CS336 and CMU's DL systems when I have enough background knowledges. I am interested in building and improving intelligent systems such as DeepProver and AlphaProof that can be used to improve math proof/research.<p>Thank you a lot!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The market has been trending towards specialists for a long time. AI may help employees in the short term be more effective generalists, and so be able to compete with specialists. AI may help specialists be even more effective in their niche, while also serve wider needs, and so compete better with employees. Something I do see happening is companies are doing a lot of low hanging fruit themselves in my space (I do revenue and business analytics). Today, they will get 80% of my specialty done themselves. That is enough for most companies. But that last 20% for those who want it, still requires a specialist like me who knows the domain entirely. reply",

There just weren't enough programmers on earth to take up the load of writing all the software that would be necessary. So new tools, like COBOL and ALGOL, were devised to help programmers produce correct software quickly. Today's software crisis is not one of too little but too much. We are absolutely spoiled for computing power -- a smartphone having enough capacity to replace a mainframe that in the 1970s or 1980s would have handled a national bank's transactions, many times over . We are awash in software, most of it bad. We need less software and better software. Stochastic slop generators are going to make this problem worse, not better. It may be a rough few years, but on the other side there will be a boom in demand for programmers to clean up the mess \"AI\" has made. reply",

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

The new code is at least twice as fast in benchmarks, but I can't run it in production because it turns out when you do it's four times as slow as what came before it for the queries that are the simplest and fastest to the point where queries exceed their timeout values by a lot. I'm 97% certain this is because the faster code leads to more page thrashing in the mmap-based index readers.  I'm gonna have to implement my own buffer pool and manage my reads directly like that vexatious paper[1] said all along. [1] https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2022/cidr2022-p13-crotty.pdf reply",

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! [Sorry for the delay.] --- FYI: For more context, I'm trying to send a PR to Chez Scheme (and indirectly to Racket) https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/pull/959 to reduce expressions like (+ 1.0 (length L))  ;  ==>  (+ 1.0 (fixnum->flonum (length L))) where the \"fixnums\" are small integers and \"flonums\" are double. It's fine, unless you have the case (+ -0.0 (length L))  ;  =wrong=>  (+ -0.0 (fixnum->flonum (length L))) because if the length is 0, it get's transformed into 0.0 instead of -0.0 There are a few corner cases, in particular because it's possible to have (+ 1.0 x (length L)) and I really want to avoid the runtime check of (length L) == 0 if possible. So I took a look, asked there, and now your opinion confirms what I got so far. My C is not very good, so it's nice to have a example of how the rounding directions are used. Luckily Chez Scheme only uses the default rounding and it's probably correct to cut a few corners. I'll take a looks for a few days in case there is some surprise. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure you can avoid the check, but you can avoid a branch. An AVX-512 extension has a `vfixupimm` instruction[1] which can adjust special floating point values. You could use this to adjust all zeroes to -0 but leave any non-zeroes untouched. It isn't very obvious how to use though. vfixupimmsd dst, src, fixup, flag\n\n * The `flag` is for error reporting - we can set it to zero to ignore errors.\n\n * `dst` and `src` are a floating point value - they can be the same register.\n\n * The instruction first checks `src` and turns any denormals into zero if the MXCSR.DAZ flag is set.\n\n * It then categorizes `src` as one of {QNAN, SNAN, ZERO, ONE, NEG_INF, POS_ING, NEG_VALUE, POS_VALUE}\n\n * `fixup` is an array of 8 nybbles (a 32-bit int) and is looked up based on the categorization of `src` {QNAN = 0 ... POS_VALUE = 7}\n\n * The values of each nybble denote which value to place into `dst`:\n\n    0x0 : dst (unchanged)\n    0x1 : src (with denormals as zero if MXCSR.DAZ is set)\n    0x2 : QNaN(src)\n    0x3 : QNAN_Indefinite\n    0x4 : -INF\n    0x5 : +INF\n    0x6 : src < 0 ? -INF : +INF\n    0x7 : -0\n    0x8 : +0\n    0x9 : -1\n    0xA : +1\n    0xB : 1/2\n    0xC : 90.0\n    0xD : PI/2\n    0xE : MAX_FLOAT\n    0xF : -MAX_FLOAT You want to  set the nybble for categorization ZERO (bits 11..8) to 0x7 (-0) in `fixup`. This would mean you want `fixup` to be equal to `0x00000700`. So usage would be: static __m128i zerofixup = { 0x700 };\n\n    double fixnum_to_flonum(int64_t fixnum) {\n        __m128d flonum = { (double)fixnum };\n        return _mm_cvtsd_f64(_mm_fixupimm_sd(flonum, flonum, zerofixup, 0));\n    } Which compiles to just 4 instructions, with no branches: .FIXUP:\n        .long   1792                            # 0x700\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n    fixnum_to_flonum:\n        vcvtsi2sd       xmm0, xmm0, rdi\n        vmovq           xmm0, xmm0\n        vfixupimmsd     xmm0, xmm0, qword ptr [rip + .FIXUP], 0\n        ret It can be extended to operate on 8 int64->double at a time (__m512d) with little extra cost. You could maybe use this optimization where the instruction is available and just stick with a branch version otherwise, or figure out some other way to make it branchless - though I can't think of any other way which would be any faster than a branch.

'Well I think a hawaiian shirt is my favorite' :) 4 b) if you know others looking, set up a weekly meeting to encourage each other and provide a sense of stability. 5) Join toastmasters.  Trust me on this, it will help immensely in the interview. 6) Make an itemized list of what your job requirements are.  What are you not willing to compromise on. 6 b) after 3 months, look at that list and decide what needs to go.  It broke my heart to move, but it was what I had to do. 7) Volunteer.

Once I had a small group, we picked a time we were all free to do a video call standup. I think it was twice a week. We’d do the usual “what we completed, what’s in progress, what we’re doing next”, then people could stay on the call to chat. We ended up giving each other mock interviews, making connections, and doing resume reviews outside of the standup. Having the support of other people going through a similar experience was very helpful, and the accountability helped keep me motivated. It was easy to set up. If people got annoyed about something like wanting to join but having a schedule conflict, or not liking the format the group wanted, I cheerfully said that’s a great idea, and suggested they start a new group. Setting that limit got rid of a lot of the annoying parts of organizing events. The group changed as people got hired or dropped out, and when I got hired I handed it off to other group members. Job hunting sucks. Having support makes it way easier. reply",

          "text": "Here's some more generalized advice about avoiding burnout while job-seeking/interviewing. I would say the best way to avoid burnout and get better results is to tailor your resume to each job posting. Most people send out general resumes which causes a candidate to blend into the crowd. My sister used to be in HR and sometimes they only have a small amount of time to skim each resume. So in your cover letter and resume you want to show off your interest in the company and skills right off the bat. Think of the job posting as bullet points, hit the major points they are looking for in the brief intro paragraph, they will have more incentive to give you an interview. If you know a graphic designer, it may be worth in to get a custom resume design. Though templates work too, just make sure to not pick a commonly used template. Consider templates on Gumroad or similar sites if you are on a budget. Another Interview Point. If it takes them 7 interviews to decide on a candidate don't bother with that company. It shows you that they are a.) Don't have their act together. A red flag for incompetence. b.) Are looking for a unicorn candidate and are just stringing you along as a backup candidate. c.) Already know who they want to hire but have to play \"the hiring game\" so they can justify why they hired their chosen candidate. I worked with a company that had me do 5 interviews to get the job and it wasn't a great experience. I ended up quitting due to the management and lack of support. My advice is a 3 interviews rule. If the company can't figure out if they want you after 3 interviews it is best to look elsewhere. You have to remember that your time has value. Hope this helps. reply",

The best jobs I've had were after 7+ rounds of actual interviews: code challenge, several peer panels, systems design, hiring manager, Senior manager, Cutler fit, etc. That of course doesn't mean there aren't companies out there abusing the system or who have less than genuine tactics. But my point is mere number of rounds isn't a good indicator of anything in isolation. I've also worked at places with less than 3 rounds that were absolutely terrible. reply",

It was only a Plan C so I didn’t expect much. I had two offers basically handed to me quickly based on my network and 1 based on targeted outreach to a company that was looking for a specific niche skillset where at the time, one of the industry experts (see time at AWS).

If you have a generic skillset - full stack developer, mobile developer, etc or even “worked at BigTech as a generic mid level developer” - all the resume optimizations don’t help.

Have a \"no politics\" rule unless you want culture warring on your platform for whatever reason. - Then you enforce the rules as you see fit. The final rule should be \"moderators have discretion\" and if someone is pushing against the rules and/or irritating others, ban them. At the same time, be lenient and give second and third chances at least for non-blatant offenses; escalate, first with a warning, then with a temp ban, then a longer temp ban, etc. It's a careful balance, but if done correctly, your form will be both tolerant and not dominated by assholes. - To prevent spam and banned users opening new accounts, either: make the form invite-only (where users can invite others) and screen applicants; charge a small fee for signing up; require flexible proof of identity (e.g. one of: phone #, Google account, GitHub account, Facebook account, etc.); require new user posts to be approved by moderators before they show up; or something else. This will make it significantly harder for your userbase to grow, and many people will refuse to sign up, but it will be hard and some people won't sign up anyways. - If your forum grows enough, you can recruit moderators. You need enough people and activity to select moderators who you trust, because every time you override their moderation or kick them beyond \"very rarely\", you look worse (more incompetent, power-tripping, incoherent) and the overall community \"vibes\" become slightly more toxic. reply",

          "text": "I owe you an apology - your brilliant analysis deserved much better than my brief response earlier. You provided the most thoughtful theoretical framework in this entire discussion, and I responded with just a throwaway line. That wasn't respectful of the depth you brought. Your analysis of Habermas and \"perfect deliberative process\" is exactly what we're grappling with in GistFans. The tension you identify between early adopter quality and scalability, the corruption of sustainable organizations vs the power of \"structureless\" activism - these are the core contradictions we're trying to navigate. We're experimenting with a \"Stars\" system where users earn influence through contributions, then spend these stars on governance decisions. The hypothesis: when participation has real cost (earned influence), people might act more thoughtfully - potentially addressing both the good faith problem AND the \"believing others act in bad faith\" issue you mention about Twitter. But your point about \"benign despotism with exit rights\" is fascinating. Maybe the key isn't eliminating hierarchy but making it transparent and merit-based rather than arbitrary? We're deliberately staying small and experimental rather than chasing sustainability/growth. Better to run genuine experiments that inform future builders than create another corrupted institution. Have you seen any examples where contribution-based influence actually improved deliberative quality? Or do the fundamental human nature issues make this unsolvable through design? reply",

We have a hybrid system: everyone gets basic voting rights (maintaining the democratic principle you describe), but we also have weighted \"contribution votes\" based on earned influence. So it's not replacing democracy, but adding a parallel track. Basic decisions use equal votes, but for governance and quality decisions, contribution-based weight provides additional input. Think of it as \"democracy plus meritocracy\" rather than replacing one with the other. But we believe: hybrid democracy is also democracy. Just as representative democracy and direct democracy are both legitimate forms of democratic governance, contribution-weighted democracy can preserve democratic legitimacy while addressing practical concerns about informed participation. This way we preserve the fundamental democratic principle you're defending - everyone has a voice - while creating mechanisms for those most invested in outcomes to have proportional influence. Do you think this hybrid approach maintains democratic legitimacy while addressing some of the practical concerns about informed decision-making? reply",

Democracy as Socrates or written by Plato would have said democracy is hard to succeed at as it’s ruled by many who may not have the education.. wisdom.. to run well for all. Read Ship of State. A certain level of freedom of speech is required, or else it’s a pool of similar thinkers. A collective who everyone else must talk and think alike, for the good of the collective. See Ayn Rand. Pretty much like downvoting, I get downvoted without knowing who or why and is a form of censorship and one or more are offended or just don’t like it. Just cuz you don’t like it doesn’t mean it should be downvoted. My other comment here on YT shorts being useful is an example. A down vote and all I said is “ I learnt drums for a song I like from shorts. Blanket bans are not a solution” Take care to not apply so much policy that group think and collectivism takes hold. reply",

          "text": "You're absolutely right about these concerns, and I should be more honest - we don't have a magic solution to groupthink. Even our transparency isn't absolute - we only guarantee proposal transparency, not complete visibility. But I think a community's real vitality might come from self-direction rather than top-down solutions. Democratic processes themselves promote community self-purification. In our ideal community, everyone has the right to propose. Every proposal goes to public vote with open voting. When proposals pass and get executed, that execution itself improves the community. This might be closer to what an ideal community looks like. Our ideal community has only one rule: community-driven. That's all. I tend to describe it as a kind of utopia - where the community continuously evolves through its own collective decisions rather than having solutions imposed from outside. Maybe the answer to groupthink isn't preventing it, but creating systems where the community can organically correct itself over time. It's admittedly idealistic, but I think there's value in experimenting with these utopian concepts, even if they don't solve every problem perfectly. What do you think - can democratic self-governance actually lead to self-correction, or am I being too optimistic about human nature? reply",
