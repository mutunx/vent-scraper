      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Project URL: https://github.com/debba/rewindtty<p>I've been working on rewindtty, a lightweight terminal session recorder and replayer written in C. It works like script/scriptreplay, but outputs structured JSON and includes a browser-based player for replaying terminal sessions with timing, scrubbing, bookmarks, and more.<p>Until now, I was recording sessions command-by-command, capturing each shell command and its output separately. That made it easy to analyze sessions and index them by command.<p>However, I just introduced a new interactive mode, which behaves more like traditional script: it records raw terminal I/O in real-time via a PTY, capturing every character typed or displayed, including control sequences.<p>This is great for realism and full session fidelity (e.g. interactive tools like htop, vim, REPLs), but it makes command detection much harder — I'm no longer intercepting input at the shell level.<p>My question is: how can I extract actual commands from this raw PTY stream?<p>I'm aware it's tricky, but I'm wondering:<p><pre><code>    Has anyone tried parsing the ANSI stream to reconstruct command boundaries?\n\n    Is it possible to hook into the shell (bash, zsh, etc.) in real-time to intercept commands?\n\n    Are there shell options or audit features that can be leveraged in parallel to raw capture?\n\n    Any prior art or libraries I should look at?\n</code></pre>\nI'd love to hear how others have approached this — either for recording, analyzing, or replaying shell sessions. Any insights or directions would be super helpful.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Email: nathaniel.bennett@gmail.com My name is Nate Bennett. I reside Thousand Oaks, Ca with my beautiful wife of almost 15yrs and 3 children. I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs. As a former professional athlete, I am looking to join a team where teamwork is paramount and opportunities for growth and learning from others are a daily occurrence. I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding. Away from the computer I enjoy working out in my garage gym, playing guitar, and playing with my kids. reply",

Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual. I am always looking to improve not only myself but also my work. reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking.

I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

My goal is always to solve the problem and make sure people know there’s a solution. In my next role, I'm looking to work with a team that values clarity and impact. I'm especially interested in data heavy environments where thoughtful tooling can make workflows better. Most recently, I built [Buckaroo]( https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo ) an open source data table for Jupyter using Pandas/Polars. It combines fast rendering, summary stats, and a low-code UI.

We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants. We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA. We’re a growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments. We’re looking for an engineer whose focus will be on using data to improve our bot detection and protection. Telling apart bots from genuine users is vital to our product. If possible, we prefer to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word even?) - choosing an if/else rule over a neural network. Good knowledge of the web is always useful in this company. At our scale we are looking for generalists more than specialists. Our engineering team is fully remote across Europe, we meet up in person a few times per year. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, fully remote or (partially) from our Munich office. Please note that we ONLY consider candidates located within the EU/UK/EEA/Switzerland.

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you've ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let's talk: info@fusionbox.com. reply",

About Solace: The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. We're a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces...

We're building voice AI for large contact centers. Everyone thinks contact centers are boring. They're wrong. It's the last place where companies actually talk to their customers. We listen to calls every week and it's fascinating. AI here actually helps real people: shorter wait times, 24/7 support, lower cost. Stellar skips the robotic text-to-speech pipeline entirely and works directly with voice. Our conversations are remarkably human, also in non-English languages and local dialects, where most AI sounds like a bad GPS navigator. \nOn top of this, we're great at integrating with the complex systems at enterprises, and meeting their compliance requirements. We're cash-flow positive, growing fast with enterprise clients queuing up, and all founders still code. We need engineers who can jump between our Go and TS backends and React frontend. This role is perfect if you: * Want massive ownership at a small team (not pretend \"impact\" at BigCo) * Actually enjoy solving hard problems (real-time audio at enterprise scale) * Think making AI sound human in niche dialects is a fun challenge Find the full vacancy here: https://www.stellarcs.ai/careers/software-engineer EU work authorization is required.

          "text": "Windows ME was bad, but not due to anything specific they did with ME. Between Windows 95, 98, 98 SE, and then ME the hardware landscape absolutely exploded (e.g. tens of new categories of devices). Which meant more third party drivers than ever before. Drivers ran in the same address space as the kernel, without isolation, and BY DESIGN would monkey-patch the kernel (with different drivers sometimes stepping on one another). This was already a problem in 98/98 SE, but the whole thing just crumbled under its own weight around the time of ME. 2000/XP by contrast had strict user mode/kernel mode isolation, processes had their own virtual memory, and kernel address space was protected (making monkey-patching more difficult). In XP in particular they also started to adopt Driver Signature Enforcement, which at that time brought a cultural rather than technical shift (i.e. everyone knew it would eventually be mandatory, and so started to tighten processes). Vista then made things even better with Mandatory Driver Signing (64-bit), PatchGuard + ASLR (i.e. no more monkey-patching the kernel), Code Integrity Checks (corruption detection), WDDM for more stable graphics drivers, and shifted some other drivers to user mode (soft failures instead of BSODs). The official sales pitch of ME over 98 SE was: System Restore (new), System File Protection (technically ported from 2K, but new for the 9x line), faster boot (due to real-mode DOS being removed), Automatic Updates, Movie Maker, and improved home networking. It was a big upgrade for people coming from 98 and still a minor upgrade from 98 SE (which a lot of people skipped, even though it was a substantial improvement for just $20 upgrade cost). PS - Vista moving to WDDM for graphics drivers, which everyone takes for granted today, is much of the reason why it was SO poorly received upon released. Vendors moved both to WDDM and in some cases to x64 for the first time, and it was a buggy mess there for at least a year -- which was blamed on Vista. reply",

Development of complex utilities from video editing to web browsers being more than just HTML viewers and fighting over limited memory trying to manage a high stack of rapidly more complex drivers and ME just didn't handle it that greatly. The modem, printer, high end GPU's and audio systems all fighting to work together. It just seems like the whole Windows system pre-NT was struggling to stay together. Cue the famous Win 98 demonstration crashing the system via a Plug and play scanner. Win 98 SE was in a bizarre stable state, ME wasn't and the differences under the hood could have been something that appeared fairly minor. reply",

I have money saved up, don’t live an extravagant lifestyle, and have around 7 years of experience but I do know how challenging the job market has been which worries me. I would also be leaving my current company towards the end of the year when not many people are hiring.<p>When asking my friends and colleagues what to do, I always get the same answer of either wait until you find something else to quit or wait until they fire you, but whatever you do don’t leave with no offer in hand.<p>I agree with their approach in general but I’m just really burned out and don’t have the mental energy to come home from a 10 hour day and start preparing for interviews. Ideally I would like time to prepare adequately for interviews and really think about what I want to do next instead of just taking the next thing I’m offered because I’m so desperate to leave my current position.<p>I’m at a point in my life where I don’t want to sacrifice my mental health just to get the next paycheck, but maybe I’m being foolish and just need to get through it.<p>Has anyone navigated a situation like this before?</p></p></p></p></div>",

It’ll feel great at first not having to work but you’ll be spending money without bringing anything in and sooner or later you’ll be needing to find a job in an unforgiving job market. I would listen to your friends, stick it out until you find another job. In the mean time, try to make some changes like not working 10 hour days, maybe take a short leave of absence, etc… but quitting your job and not having another one lined up is almost always a mistake unless you a very large sum of money saved up or some other source of income.

Hackerrank is fast going out the window. Every company that wants to raise money needs to be an AI company so they're not going to tell you not to use AI during the interview. You can screenshot questions, paste it into a deprecated AI model, and it'll spit out the exact answer. Using the AI tools if you haven't might also get you your next job.

          "text": "I’ve done that right before the market downshift in 2023. I’ve spent 3 months doing nothing, travelled to a bunch of cities that I’ve never been to, did tons of works in my own projects (both open and closed source), and actually managed to launch one that is still going. Honestly, this in-between period was one of the most personally rewarding times I’ve ever had in my career, I was feeling great, I was waking up in the morning and coding for a hour before I even had coffee, I had good humor for such a long stretch of time that even people I don’t talk to daily started to notice. But, despite that, actually looking for a new job was soul crushing. I had a spreadsheet to track applications, and the rows just kept piling up, interviews were not happening, when they were happening I got ghosted dozens of times, when I didn’t get ghosted, the code interviews were absolutely ridiculous is all sorts of ways, even I passed code testings companies paused hirings, when I finally got to the last step they’d say culture didn’t align. I got a job after 7 months and 137 applications. It was TERRIBLE, the feeling of hopelessness, the feeling that there is no future, the feeling that your entire 20+ year career is useless and the fear you’ll never find a job again. I don’t wish that on anyone. In the end there are bills to be paid, and you can’t stay unemployed forever, so the reality means you have to thread this carefully. It sounds counterproductive and it is hard, but concentrate less on work, spend time doing things you want, and do not go out for interviews just yet. On top of having a shitty job, you’ll also have shitty evenings because you’ll get to this same soul crushing realization of mine. Do the minimum acceptable at work, cut hours, take vacation, whatever that keeps you employed, and spend any energy you have left doing things you want. Workout, that pet project that hadn’t seen any love, binging Netflix, whatever you mind tells you to do. As long as it doesn’t get worse than it is, it is a win. You are going to leave the company anyway (either voluntarily or not), might as well stockpile some money if you can. The goal is to get better _despite_ the shitty job, to improve yourself while you are still getting paid. Also important: go looking for social support, like lunch with friends and old coworkers, therapy, some meetups on subjects you have interest, whatever you can to talk to people. Mildly venting off helps, just make sure to not overdo and also listen. reply",

As such, I've had a similar experience to yours so far. I've been travelling and volunteering around the world, I'm also back to coding as a hobby again, and also working on other projects like robots, rc planes, and welding. Also exercising. I'm just living the life I actually want. And so fortunate to be able to live it with my partner. This break, like for you, has been one of the most rewarding things ever in my entire life. On the days I really get to experience the spice life one way or another, I feel as much if not more accomplished than I ever did even shipping the largest projects. I also try to remind myself every day to be grateful for the opportunity to pause my career as it is such a gift. I believe gratitude is critical for staying grounded as the person I want to be. But it is also countered by the soul crushing job hunt. I haven't been fully focused on finding a job yet, but I have applied to many interesting opportunities already and not getting responses from these companies, despite me believing I have a somewhat strong resume, puts a pit in my stomach for the reasons you stated so well: questioning my own competence, and worrying about the future. That said, the positives have been so huge, though, that I have to at least try to recommend a break like this to people who feel burnout, especially if they are burnt out yet again. I would urge anyone to always be evaluating what is really important in your life and work towards that as an alternative to working to the bone for promotion and bonuses because we think we should. I wish we all could take the breaks our brains deserve, yet we have to do what we have to do. As one final thought, I will say that soon after quitting my job for this adventure, I was already feeling refreshed and better, and to anyone reading this, your life is worth more than money. reply",

Unfortunately, most people’s reality force them to consider money. Someone else mentioned to triple your estimate of how long you might be without a job, and sometimes not even that is enough. In the end, it’s mostly about your safety nets. Can you quit, stay 6 months away, and if it turns into 18 months, what then? Can you move back into your parents’? Are you _realistically_ able to take a non-dev job (cashier at McDonalds) just to put food on the table? Nowadays, affording a decent life AND the job not sucking is almost a luxury already.

Questions you need to answer before quitting: 1) is there anything they can do to keep you - you need to be prepared to answer this, not emotionally but with logic and your sanity in mind 2) is your resume ready?  If not when will it be ready. 3) how do you answer the question: Why did you leave?  The simple answer of 'They were toxic' sounds too much like BS.  It could be interpreted as you are toxic and not willing to see your own problems. 4) are you able to spend 6 months to a year unemployed?  Can you cover all expenses. Including medical. 5) if you are out of work long term, how do you explain what you have been doing?  Best answers are: learning new stuff (with details, possibly a degree), volunteering.  Worst answers: finding yourself, just relaxing, doom scrolling youtube. 6) if you have unemployed friends, set up a group.  See question here where someone was asking how to handle long term unemployment. 7) What are your criteria for the next job.  Clearly not toxic but how are you going to ensure that does not happen.

And can you deal with the salary hit (you'll very likely get a new job with a much lower salary)? I quit a few weeks ago – I was being pushed out. It was not fun. I'm still processing how much psychological warfare was really going on and how much I was being gaslit. I was going to do some travelling but I can't stop looking at my budgeting spreadsheet. But luckily it's summer and where I live is quite nice. I'm still in recovery mode. Some health issues have already resolved themselves. I've lost ~8 pounds. I'm sleeping better. What is keeping me sane is that I knew the job, the environment, my colleagues etc was seriously not working and I would have got fired anyway. Luckily my family can help me out a little bit each month, and I'm thinking of getting a housemate, both of which will reduce my burn rate massively. I have enjoyed re-evaluating my spending. It was a bit out of control. I was getting fat eating too much expensive food/takeout etc. I'm cooking more. It feels weird being away from the computer. I feel like I should be learning more AI/interview prep etc. Like every moment not doing that is further damaging my future. Ugh. But I've also massively lost my love for tech. I need to find out if I can rediscover it I wish I had watched a lot more Jordan Peterson etc a year ago. He touches a lot on having a plan, not just giving up, really contemplating the future, explaining poverty isn't fun, analytically working backwards from your problems etc. It's like the advice my father might have given me if I had one. I think I have mental health issues that affected my work, rather than my job being the sole source of all my mental health issues. Ultimately it really is trading one set of stresses and issues for another, I feel. reply",

These are both excellent ways to reduce your living expenses, particularly spreading the cost of housing + utilities over two or more people by sharing a house or an apartment.  Also a great way to boost your savings rate when you start making an income again. reply",

          "text": "In my case, it was a mistake. It's very tempting because (I'm guessing) you just want to get out of your current situation ASAP, and of course the final decision is still yours, but this is the advice I would give my past self: - You might not be in the best state of mind right now to make a good decision. I agree with others saying you should take time off, the more the better. Definitely more than one week. - Try going for 1-2 months of time off if possible, even if unpaid. If your country has something like \"leave of absence\" that allows you to take a long period off, like 6 months or more (usually unpaid), but still be able to come back to your company after that period (or at least get priority during hires for the similar position), then try to look into that first, and consider it a \"trial period\" of how well your job search will go. - You might feel good about leaving your job for the first few months, but after that you're running on a time limit. This will be on the back of your mind, and you'll have to learn to live with this worry, and not let it affect your performance on interviews. - You'll get rejected. You'll get ghosted. You might think it's you, and part of it will be because of you, but you don't know which rejections are legit and which ones were just farming your info. This will also take a toll on you, and you will have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. - The more time you've been unemployed, the larger the gap on your resume, the better you'll have to be at explaining that gap in a convincing way. And this is without letting the previous point affect your performance on interviews. - Remember that when you apply for roles, when you reach the last stage (the vibe check), you'll be competing against people with no gap, who might be able to perform better than you if only because they have less worries (no ever-increasing gap, no ever-decreasing money, a rejection for them doesn't affect them too much because they still have a job). - Even if you think you have a good network that could help you get a job quickly, consider their location. Assume you'll only be able to get some help from contacts in your current location (within commute time). Even if you're looking for remote jobs, assume your network will only be able to help, at most, with on-site jobs. - Even if you do freelance work, consider those as part of your employment gap. You might get interviews for companies that don't mind it, but assume that most companies default to treating it as an employment gap. - If you feel bad right now at work, assume that's similar to how bad you'll feel after being unable to get a job for 1 year, but with less money on top of that. And you'll have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. --- That's what I would have liked someone told me before I left my last full-time job. I'm aware I'm just some stranger on the internet exposing how much I suck at life because I wasn't able to just get a job quickly like others, and I underestimated a lot of shit. So I think what I want to say is, \"think carefully\". reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Dear all,<p>I learned some basic ML from Andrew Ng's Coursera course more than 10 years ago, recently I graduated from the Math Master program and have some free time in my hand, so I am thinking about picking up ML/DL again.<p>In [Yacine's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6PIchDOcQ), he mentioned [fast.ai's course](https://course.fast.ai/), which I heard of in the past but didn't look into too much. The table of contents of [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) looks pretty solid, but it was published in 2020, so I was wondering given the pace of AI development, do you think this book or course series is still a good choice and relevant for today's learners?<p>*To provide more context about me*: I did math major and CS minor (with Python background) during undergrad but have never taken any ML/DL courses (other than that Coursera one), and I just finished the Master program in math, though I have background and always have interests in graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.<p>I have two books \"Hands-on Machine Learning\" by Geron and \"Hands-on LLMs\" by Alammar and Grootendorst, and plan to finish Stanford's CS224N and CS336 and CMU's DL systems when I have enough background knowledges. I am interested in building and improving intelligent systems such as DeepProver and AlphaProof that can be used to improve math proof/research.<p>Thank you a lot!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The market has been trending towards specialists for a long time. AI may help employees in the short term be more effective generalists, and so be able to compete with specialists. AI may help specialists be even more effective in their niche, while also serve wider needs, and so compete better with employees. Something I do see happening is companies are doing a lot of low hanging fruit themselves in my space (I do revenue and business analytics). Today, they will get 80% of my specialty done themselves. That is enough for most companies. But that last 20% for those who want it, still requires a specialist like me who knows the domain entirely. reply",

There just weren't enough programmers on earth to take up the load of writing all the software that would be necessary. So new tools, like COBOL and ALGOL, were devised to help programmers produce correct software quickly. Today's software crisis is not one of too little but too much. We are absolutely spoiled for computing power -- a smartphone having enough capacity to replace a mainframe that in the 1970s or 1980s would have handled a national bank's transactions, many times over . We are awash in software, most of it bad. We need less software and better software. Stochastic slop generators are going to make this problem worse, not better. It may be a rough few years, but on the other side there will be a boom in demand for programmers to clean up the mess \"AI\" has made. reply",

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

The new code is at least twice as fast in benchmarks, but I can't run it in production because it turns out when you do it's four times as slow as what came before it for the queries that are the simplest and fastest to the point where queries exceed their timeout values by a lot. I'm 97% certain this is because the faster code leads to more page thrashing in the mmap-based index readers.  I'm gonna have to implement my own buffer pool and manage my reads directly like that vexatious paper[1] said all along. [1] https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2022/cidr2022-p13-crotty.pdf reply",

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! [Sorry for the delay.] --- FYI: For more context, I'm trying to send a PR to Chez Scheme (and indirectly to Racket) https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/pull/959 to reduce expressions like (+ 1.0 (length L))  ;  ==>  (+ 1.0 (fixnum->flonum (length L))) where the \"fixnums\" are small integers and \"flonums\" are double. It's fine, unless you have the case (+ -0.0 (length L))  ;  =wrong=>  (+ -0.0 (fixnum->flonum (length L))) because if the length is 0, it get's transformed into 0.0 instead of -0.0 There are a few corner cases, in particular because it's possible to have (+ 1.0 x (length L)) and I really want to avoid the runtime check of (length L) == 0 if possible. So I took a look, asked there, and now your opinion confirms what I got so far. My C is not very good, so it's nice to have a example of how the rounding directions are used. Luckily Chez Scheme only uses the default rounding and it's probably correct to cut a few corners. I'll take a looks for a few days in case there is some surprise. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure you can avoid the check, but you can avoid a branch. An AVX-512 extension has a `vfixupimm` instruction[1] which can adjust special floating point values. You could use this to adjust all zeroes to -0 but leave any non-zeroes untouched. It isn't very obvious how to use though. vfixupimmsd dst, src, fixup, flag\n\n * The `flag` is for error reporting - we can set it to zero to ignore errors.\n\n * `dst` and `src` are a floating point value - they can be the same register.\n\n * The instruction first checks `src` and turns any denormals into zero if the MXCSR.DAZ flag is set.\n\n * It then categorizes `src` as one of {QNAN, SNAN, ZERO, ONE, NEG_INF, POS_ING, NEG_VALUE, POS_VALUE}\n\n * `fixup` is an array of 8 nybbles (a 32-bit int) and is looked up based on the categorization of `src` {QNAN = 0 ... POS_VALUE = 7}\n\n * The values of each nybble denote which value to place into `dst`:\n\n    0x0 : dst (unchanged)\n    0x1 : src (with denormals as zero if MXCSR.DAZ is set)\n    0x2 : QNaN(src)\n    0x3 : QNAN_Indefinite\n    0x4 : -INF\n    0x5 : +INF\n    0x6 : src < 0 ? -INF : +INF\n    0x7 : -0\n    0x8 : +0\n    0x9 : -1\n    0xA : +1\n    0xB : 1/2\n    0xC : 90.0\n    0xD : PI/2\n    0xE : MAX_FLOAT\n    0xF : -MAX_FLOAT You want to  set the nybble for categorization ZERO (bits 11..8) to 0x7 (-0) in `fixup`. This would mean you want `fixup` to be equal to `0x00000700`. So usage would be: static __m128i zerofixup = { 0x700 };\n\n    double fixnum_to_flonum(int64_t fixnum) {\n        __m128d flonum = { (double)fixnum };\n        return _mm_cvtsd_f64(_mm_fixupimm_sd(flonum, flonum, zerofixup, 0));\n    } Which compiles to just 4 instructions, with no branches: .FIXUP:\n        .long   1792                            # 0x700\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n        .long   0                               # 0x0\n    fixnum_to_flonum:\n        vcvtsi2sd       xmm0, xmm0, rdi\n        vmovq           xmm0, xmm0\n        vfixupimmsd     xmm0, xmm0, qword ptr [rip + .FIXUP], 0\n        ret It can be extended to operate on 8 int64->double at a time (__m512d) with little extra cost. You could maybe use this optimization where the instruction is available and just stick with a branch version otherwise, or figure out some other way to make it branchless - though I can't think of any other way which would be any faster than a branch.

'Well I think a hawaiian shirt is my favorite' :) 4 b) if you know others looking, set up a weekly meeting to encourage each other and provide a sense of stability. 5) Join toastmasters.  Trust me on this, it will help immensely in the interview. 6) Make an itemized list of what your job requirements are.  What are you not willing to compromise on. 6 b) after 3 months, look at that list and decide what needs to go.  It broke my heart to move, but it was what I had to do. 7) Volunteer.

Once I had a small group, we picked a time we were all free to do a video call standup. I think it was twice a week. We’d do the usual “what we completed, what’s in progress, what we’re doing next”, then people could stay on the call to chat. We ended up giving each other mock interviews, making connections, and doing resume reviews outside of the standup. Having the support of other people going through a similar experience was very helpful, and the accountability helped keep me motivated. It was easy to set up. If people got annoyed about something like wanting to join but having a schedule conflict, or not liking the format the group wanted, I cheerfully said that’s a great idea, and suggested they start a new group. Setting that limit got rid of a lot of the annoying parts of organizing events. The group changed as people got hired or dropped out, and when I got hired I handed it off to other group members. Job hunting sucks. Having support makes it way easier. reply",

          "text": "Here's some more generalized advice about avoiding burnout while job-seeking/interviewing. I would say the best way to avoid burnout and get better results is to tailor your resume to each job posting. Most people send out general resumes which causes a candidate to blend into the crowd. My sister used to be in HR and sometimes they only have a small amount of time to skim each resume. So in your cover letter and resume you want to show off your interest in the company and skills right off the bat. Think of the job posting as bullet points, hit the major points they are looking for in the brief intro paragraph, they will have more incentive to give you an interview. If you know a graphic designer, it may be worth in to get a custom resume design. Though templates work too, just make sure to not pick a commonly used template. Consider templates on Gumroad or similar sites if you are on a budget. Another Interview Point. If it takes them 7 interviews to decide on a candidate don't bother with that company. It shows you that they are a.) Don't have their act together. A red flag for incompetence. b.) Are looking for a unicorn candidate and are just stringing you along as a backup candidate. c.) Already know who they want to hire but have to play \"the hiring game\" so they can justify why they hired their chosen candidate. I worked with a company that had me do 5 interviews to get the job and it wasn't a great experience. I ended up quitting due to the management and lack of support. My advice is a 3 interviews rule. If the company can't figure out if they want you after 3 interviews it is best to look elsewhere. You have to remember that your time has value. Hope this helps. reply",

The best jobs I've had were after 7+ rounds of actual interviews: code challenge, several peer panels, systems design, hiring manager, Senior manager, Cutler fit, etc. That of course doesn't mean there aren't companies out there abusing the system or who have less than genuine tactics. But my point is mere number of rounds isn't a good indicator of anything in isolation. I've also worked at places with less than 3 rounds that were absolutely terrible. reply",

It was only a Plan C so I didn’t expect much. I had two offers basically handed to me quickly based on my network and 1 based on targeted outreach to a company that was looking for a specific niche skillset where at the time, one of the industry experts (see time at AWS).

If you have a generic skillset - full stack developer, mobile developer, etc or even “worked at BigTech as a generic mid level developer” - all the resume optimizations don’t help.

Have a \"no politics\" rule unless you want culture warring on your platform for whatever reason. - Then you enforce the rules as you see fit. The final rule should be \"moderators have discretion\" and if someone is pushing against the rules and/or irritating others, ban them. At the same time, be lenient and give second and third chances at least for non-blatant offenses; escalate, first with a warning, then with a temp ban, then a longer temp ban, etc. It's a careful balance, but if done correctly, your form will be both tolerant and not dominated by assholes. - To prevent spam and banned users opening new accounts, either: make the form invite-only (where users can invite others) and screen applicants; charge a small fee for signing up; require flexible proof of identity (e.g. one of: phone #, Google account, GitHub account, Facebook account, etc.); require new user posts to be approved by moderators before they show up; or something else. This will make it significantly harder for your userbase to grow, and many people will refuse to sign up, but it will be hard and some people won't sign up anyways. - If your forum grows enough, you can recruit moderators. You need enough people and activity to select moderators who you trust, because every time you override their moderation or kick them beyond \"very rarely\", you look worse (more incompetent, power-tripping, incoherent) and the overall community \"vibes\" become slightly more toxic. reply",

          "text": "I owe you an apology - your brilliant analysis deserved much better than my brief response earlier. You provided the most thoughtful theoretical framework in this entire discussion, and I responded with just a throwaway line. That wasn't respectful of the depth you brought. Your analysis of Habermas and \"perfect deliberative process\" is exactly what we're grappling with in GistFans. The tension you identify between early adopter quality and scalability, the corruption of sustainable organizations vs the power of \"structureless\" activism - these are the core contradictions we're trying to navigate. We're experimenting with a \"Stars\" system where users earn influence through contributions, then spend these stars on governance decisions. The hypothesis: when participation has real cost (earned influence), people might act more thoughtfully - potentially addressing both the good faith problem AND the \"believing others act in bad faith\" issue you mention about Twitter. But your point about \"benign despotism with exit rights\" is fascinating. Maybe the key isn't eliminating hierarchy but making it transparent and merit-based rather than arbitrary? We're deliberately staying small and experimental rather than chasing sustainability/growth. Better to run genuine experiments that inform future builders than create another corrupted institution. Have you seen any examples where contribution-based influence actually improved deliberative quality? Or do the fundamental human nature issues make this unsolvable through design? reply",

We have a hybrid system: everyone gets basic voting rights (maintaining the democratic principle you describe), but we also have weighted \"contribution votes\" based on earned influence. So it's not replacing democracy, but adding a parallel track. Basic decisions use equal votes, but for governance and quality decisions, contribution-based weight provides additional input. Think of it as \"democracy plus meritocracy\" rather than replacing one with the other. But we believe: hybrid democracy is also democracy. Just as representative democracy and direct democracy are both legitimate forms of democratic governance, contribution-weighted democracy can preserve democratic legitimacy while addressing practical concerns about informed participation. This way we preserve the fundamental democratic principle you're defending - everyone has a voice - while creating mechanisms for those most invested in outcomes to have proportional influence. Do you think this hybrid approach maintains democratic legitimacy while addressing some of the practical concerns about informed decision-making? reply",

Just cuz you don’t like it doesn’t mean it should be downvoted. My other comment here on YT shorts being useful is an example.

          "text": "You're absolutely right about these concerns, and I should be more honest - we don't have a magic solution to groupthink. Even our transparency isn't absolute - we only guarantee proposal transparency, not complete visibility. But I think a community's real vitality might come from self-direction rather than top-down solutions. Democratic processes themselves promote community self-purification. In our ideal community, everyone has the right to propose. Every proposal goes to public vote with open voting. When proposals pass and get executed, that execution itself improves the community. This might be closer to what an ideal community looks like. Our ideal community has only one rule: community-driven. That's all. I tend to describe it as a kind of utopia - where the community continuously evolves through its own collective decisions rather than having solutions imposed from outside. Maybe the answer to groupthink isn't preventing it, but creating systems where the community can organically correct itself over time. It's admittedly idealistic, but I think there's value in experimenting with these utopian concepts, even if they don't solve every problem perfectly. What do you think - can democratic self-governance actually lead to self-correction, or am I being too optimistic about human nature? reply",

Meanwhile, the '$1 today is more valuable than $1 tomorrow' trope isn't just true for monetary value, but also for the value $1 might bring. $1 today can buy memories for the rest of your life. It can bring experiences with family members and friends. Having $1 million in the bank in 40 years will never buy back time you may have wasted working to save that money. I'm not saying that people shouldn't save or invest money for the long term, but I do think more people should take into account what they lose today by only focusing on the long term... Especially when that long term might never come. reply",

Another way to look at it is you have time, effort, and savings; you need to balance them all because time will run out.

          "text": "This has become a personal debate for me recently, ever since I learned that there are several software luminaries who eschew debuggers (the equivalent of taking an oscilliscope probe to a piece of electronics). I’ve always fallen on the side of debugging being about “isolate as narrowly as possible” and “don’t guess what’s happening when you can KNOW what’s happening”. The arguments against this approach is that speculation and statically analyzing a system reinforces that system in your mind and makes you more effective overall in the long run, even if it may take longer to isolate a single defect. I’ll stick with my debuggers, but I do agree that you can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. The modern extreme is asking Cursor’s AI agent “why is this broken?” I recently saw a relatively senior engineer joining a new company lean too heavily on Cursor to understand a company’s systems. They burned a lot of cycles getting poor answers. I think this is a far worse extreme. reply",

In very few cases you are solving an actually generic problem. These are usually low hanging fruit already solved in a standard library or are available as an open source package in your eco system of choice. Your business logic is not general. reply",

You fist spend hours working out and reviewing and correcting and improving detailed specs and implementation plans, and then hand over the implementation to the LLM. There are too many implicit contextual details that the LLM doesn’t know about that just make coding based on “vibes” not work at all. Eg the size of your organization heavily influences the types of tests you want to write and maintain. So you still need a very solid understanding of engineering and your domain in order to get it to solve your problems properly. But in the end, if you learn how to use it well, it’s an insane productivity boost. But you need to spend a month or two to learn how they really work, their limitations, and figure out a workflow. reply",

Explaining a project's vision or goals give my brain a mini-version of the feeling of accomplishment of actually doing it, and I found that I would use that as a replacement for actually building stuff (which is much more work). Instead, if I only talk about the parts that I've completed, it's very motivating to build the next step so that I can share it. It also gave me more flexibility to change course during a project. reply",

Right now my current \"project\" is building a stock of photos so that I can post a continuous stream of photos on social https://mastodon.social/@UP8/tagged/photography This is pretty consuming because my developing process is intensive.  I took about 3500 photos of two basketball games on Jan 31 and picked out about 400 to develop in DxO,  I chose one color grade for all of them because a lot of the girls had bad acne that I wanted to minimize,  now I am cropping them and applying local microcontrast to the parts in focus (but not faces of athletes with acne)  I expect this take a few evenings,  then there are many more batches of photos to develop including other games as well as tranches of flowers and landscapes.  I have probably 15k undeveloped photos where those came from. Another stream of that work is building an autoposter which will make it easier to keep these coming,  for a while I was posting to Mastodon + Bluesky but lately I am posting to Facebook and LinkedIn,  want to add Instagram (hate the UI for uploading) and Threads and anything else I can.  That's blocked by my work to finish my Python API for using Postgres as an arangodb-like document database which blocks a whole bunch of projects that both involve moving forward,  like a general purpose trainer for text classification and getting YOShInOn (my RSS reader) off arangodb.

The photo thing is converging towards transitioning from semi-pro to pro,  figuring building my rep as a ‘social media photographer’ will get me work.

This \"Always Be Launching\" is really wrapping the product up in the hype from the outset. I've started to do things like just email my list and explain that I'm considering making something. what questions or concerns would they have about it.  And I consistently ask my email list if there's something I can improve about something I already launched. The Book Launch by Jeff Walker helped put into plain terms the actual questions and how I go about pre-launching something I haven't made yet.

Post-it the thought/idea/notion all over the house to make focus.\n   4. Talking it through to yourself.  Using yourself in a 2/3rd person.

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunhye-choicode Email: eunhye[at]choicode.com Hi, I’m EunHye, a software engineer with over six years of experience in ad tech and building data-driven platforms. I’ve worked full-time remotely for a U.S.-based startup, where I developed a customer data streaming platform, integrated third-party APIs, and built dashboards with React to help customers interact with their data. My experience has given me a strong foundation in working with distributed global teams and thriving in international remote setups. I’m currently seeking opportunities to bring my skills and expertise to an innovative and forward-thinking team. If you know of any opportunities or would like to connect, I’d love to hear from you. Thank you so much for your time! P.S. You can see more specifics about my experience and the technologies I use on my website: https://choicode.com reply",

Now I'm looking to help another technical product become more human. What I deliver (bringing 10 years of indie puzzle gaming insights to software): * Tutorial thinking - Design onboarding where users learn by doing, not reading docs * Progressive complexity - Reveal features as users are ready, not all at once * Intrinsic motivation - Create products people use because they want to, not have to * Discovery moments - Build \"aha!\" experiences into routine workflows * Natural sharing - Design features worth showing off (no forced virality) * Satisfaction loops - Make the 100th use as rewarding as the first Previously: SpicyNodes (40M users), time.gov (2M monthly), medical AI for 1.5M patients. PI on $295K NSF SBIR. I excel at the intersection of technical depth and human understanding - whether building atomic clock interfaces or language models. Seeking: VP Product or CPO role at companies building AI products. Particularly interested in semantic search, knowledge tools, or creative AI applications.

Email: cncerra (at) gmail.com I'm a fullstack developer with a preference for backend work and pretty good at integrations.

I'm looking for a senior-track/mid-level software engineering role at a product-focused company. I left the role I held for 5 years to learn new things - so although I have a soft spot for Ruby on Rails/React projects, I'm also excited to learn about other languages/frameworks.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been thinking about legacy lately. If you knew this was the last thing you'd ever build as a developer, what would it be?<p>Not your most profitable idea. Not the safest bet. But the thing that would make you feel like you used your skills for something that mattered.<p>If this were my last project, I think I'd want to leave behind a truly democratic, community-driven platform where developers from all backgrounds could freely exchange ideas and knowledge.<p>This platform would be open source. Every community member could contribute to its development. Every contribution - whether code, insights, or helping others - would convert into Stars, which represent voting power. All community members could use their Stars to vote on the platform's future direction.<p>I'd want this platform to continuously self-evolve, adapting and serving developers while maintaining permanent democracy and independence. Something that could keep pace with the times, evolving alongside technology and the community itself.<p>Maybe it's idealistic, but if it's your last shot, why not try to solve something that's bothered you for years? Every developer community I've loved eventually loses its soul to power concentration and politics.<p>What would your final project be?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The job is classical — mostly building web portals — but those portals open into the quantum world. Quantum computing knowledge is a plus, but not required. The initial project is a platform to understand the trajectory of quantum computing. The focus is on data visualization, so strong skills in that area are preferred. The candidate will work mostly alongside quantum engineers and researchers, so ownership to work independently on the classical side of things is important. The stack of the main web project is PERN, but the organization maintains other projects in Python.

We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration.

We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance.

About Solace: The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. We're a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces...

          "text": "I am 41 years old. I failed at almost everything till 35 in my career. I was down at my last $800 in my bank account with a dependent wife and a kid. Somehow I found a good job at 35 and I became financially stable. This stability gave me freedom to pursue few other projects and I got success in all other things. So success will definitely come to you over time if you stick and plan for it. The biggest skills you need to develop are resilience and not taking yourself too seriously. We are a very small blip in this massive Universe and our goal is just to try our best and leave the results to almighty. reply",

But since you're worried about \"being behind\" and \"not making it\", perhaps you should reflect on what you mean by those things. You're \"behind\" what? How do you define success and failure? In any case, my advice to you is that you're just getting started. It's far too soon to seriously fear failure in your life. The important thing in anything isn't the current state, it's the trendline. As long as you are moving in the general direction of your goals, you'll be fine. reply",

          "text": "In interviews, I do care, but more on why you're using this stack. If you know only one stack and use that for everything, that's pretty bad. If you're thinking, \"Hey let's use JS/Kotlin on every part of the stack,\" that hints at a fear of learning new stacks as well. By ten years of experience, you should probably have used all the major tech stacks in your area of expertise. If you're BE, probably Go, Node, Rails, Django, Spring, maybe even PHP. If mobile you should be able to use native, capacitor, PWA, Flutter, React Native, maybe KMP. And so on. It's sometimes a bonus if you're using something someone has never heard of. Y Combinator is named after a Lisp thing. PG was using Lisp as a hack while everyone else was using C and he credits it for his rapid development speed. Many tools are just built for teams of > 3, and lose the advantage of having a solo dev. If you're competing with Google's AI team and you use something generic, then... you're probably not going to make it. If you're building something that doesn't require a lot of technical expertise, they might still want to suss out that you know the difference between JavaScript and Java. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Project URL: https://github.com/debba/rewindtty<p>I've been working on rewindtty, a lightweight terminal session recorder and replayer written in C. It works like script/scriptreplay, but outputs structured JSON and includes a browser-based player for replaying terminal sessions with timing, scrubbing, bookmarks, and more.<p>Until now, I was recording sessions command-by-command, capturing each shell command and its output separately. That made it easy to analyze sessions and index them by command.<p>However, I just introduced a new interactive mode, which behaves more like traditional script: it records raw terminal I/O in real-time via a PTY, capturing every character typed or displayed, including control sequences.<p>This is great for realism and full session fidelity (e.g. interactive tools like htop, vim, REPLs), but it makes command detection much harder — I'm no longer intercepting input at the shell level.<p>My question is: how can I extract actual commands from this raw PTY stream?<p>I'm aware it's tricky, but I'm wondering:<p><pre><code>    Has anyone tried parsing the ANSI stream to reconstruct command boundaries?\n\n    Is it possible to hook into the shell (bash, zsh, etc.) in real-time to intercept commands?\n\n    Are there shell options or audit features that can be leveraged in parallel to raw capture?\n\n    Any prior art or libraries I should look at?\n</code></pre>\nI'd love to hear how others have approached this — either for recording, analyzing, or replaying shell sessions. Any insights or directions would be super helpful.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Some are great to just merge, others you have no clue what they are doing wrong but it's totally them; and you get paid in github stars? Now there's a bunch of open source projects that are just working for me every day, but i havent modified in years and they look stagnant. but even in the non-open source realm, no dev wants to forever maintain a project. Its not a regret, just 1 dev can probably only be responsible for a handful of codebases/projects and ai coding isnt going to super expand this. reply",

          "text": "Obsidian distributes their software for free, and makes money on a core plugin called Obsidian Sync (note that it is not open source). Obsidian Sync relies on their cloud to offer e2ee file sync. Obsidian also has a rich plugin ecosystem with lots of open source plugins that are available and serve the same purpose (and you can use gdrive, dropbox, etc too). It makes sense to me that they released a proprietary privacy and security focused plugin (that is their core business) and they don't want other plugins to be able to arbitrarily change the server that their plugin is pointed at. Suppose they have a government customer who is using Obsidian Sync and the sync URL can be changed easily via configuration changes -- now the customer believes they are using Obsidian Sync, but actually their data is going somewhere else. I don't think you would be surprised to find that e.g. a dropbox daemon has protections to make sure it is pointing at dropbox.com. Why would you expect Obsidian to be different? (disclaimer: I work on a different plugin that adds file sync and collaboration features to Obsidian) reply",

Secondly you say that \"no professional programmer\" - but the statement is false. For starters it's a sweeping generalization which is trivial to show is untrue for at least 1 programmer. Thirdly the existence of Open Source alternatuve does not make a product uncompetitive. You need look no further than Windows to see that's true. Indeed if we has to list all the commercial software that exists with an Ooen Source clone, we'd be here all day. I'd also argue that Joe public doesn't even know what open source is, much less factors it into a buying decision. If you are building tools for programmers (already a tiny niche target market) then you need a hook other than Open Source anyway, cause programmers are a terrible target market. I say this as someone who builds tools for programmers, and who sells commercial into a space that contains Open Source alternatives. And I do ok. reply",

Ideally I would like time to prepare adequately for interviews and really think about what I want to do next instead of just taking the next thing I’m offered because I’m so desperate to leave my current position.<p>I’m at a point in my life where I don’t want to sacrifice my mental health just to get the next paycheck, but maybe I’m being foolish and just need to get through it.<p>Has anyone navigated a situation like this before?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I’ve done that right before the market downshift in 2023. I’ve spent 3 months doing nothing, travelled to a bunch of cities that I’ve never been to, did tons of works in my own projects (both open and closed source), and actually managed to launch one that is still going. Honestly, this in-between period was one of the most personally rewarding times I’ve ever had in my career, I was feeling great, I was waking up in the morning and coding for a hour before I even had coffee, I had good humor for such a long stretch of time that even people I don’t talk to daily started to notice. But, despite that, actually looking for a new job was soul crushing. I had a spreadsheet to track applications, and the rows just kept piling up, interviews were not happening, when they were happening I got ghosted dozens of times, when I didn’t get ghosted, the code interviews were absolutely ridiculous is all sorts of ways, even I passed code testings companies paused hirings, when I finally got to the last step they’d say culture didn’t align. I got a job after 7 months and 137 applications. It was TERRIBLE, the feeling of hopelessness, the feeling that there is no future, the feeling that your entire 20+ year career is useless and the fear you’ll never find a job again. I don’t wish that on anyone. In the end there are bills to be paid, and you can’t stay unemployed forever, so the reality means you have to thread this carefully. It sounds counterproductive and it is hard, but concentrate less on work, spend time doing things you want, and do not go out for interviews just yet. On top of having a shitty job, you’ll also have shitty evenings because you’ll get to this same soul crushing realization of mine. Do the minimum acceptable at work, cut hours, take vacation, whatever that keeps you employed, and spend any energy you have left doing things you want. Workout, that pet project that hadn’t seen any love, binging Netflix, whatever you mind tells you to do. As long as it doesn’t get worse than it is, it is a win. You are going to leave the company anyway (either voluntarily or not), might as well stockpile some money if you can. The goal is to get better _despite_ the shitty job, to improve yourself while you are still getting paid. Also important: go looking for social support, like lunch with friends and old coworkers, therapy, some meetups on subjects you have interest, whatever you can to talk to people. Mildly venting off helps, just make sure to not overdo and also listen. reply",

          "text": "I am currently a few months through a planned and budgeted break from my career to focus on traveling specifically for treating burnout. As such, I've had a similar experience to yours so far. I've been travelling and volunteering around the world, I'm also back to coding as a hobby again, and also working on other projects like robots, rc planes, and welding. Also exercising. I'm just living the life I actually want. And so fortunate to be able to live it with my partner. This break, like for you, has been one of the most rewarding things ever in my entire life. On the days I really get to experience the spice life one way or another, I feel as much if not more accomplished than I ever did even shipping the largest projects. I also try to remind myself every day to be grateful for the opportunity to pause my career as it is such a gift. I believe gratitude is critical for staying grounded as the person I want to be. But it is also countered by the soul crushing job hunt. I haven't been fully focused on finding a job yet, but I have applied to many interesting opportunities already and not getting responses from these companies, despite me believing I have a somewhat strong resume, puts a pit in my stomach for the reasons you stated so well: questioning my own competence, and worrying about the future. That said, the positives have been so huge, though, that I have to at least try to recommend a break like this to people who feel burnout, especially if they are burnt out yet again. I would urge anyone to always be evaluating what is really important in your life and work towards that as an alternative to working to the bone for promotion and bonuses because we think we should. I wish we all could take the breaks our brains deserve, yet we have to do what we have to do. As one final thought, I will say that soon after quitting my job for this adventure, I was already feeling refreshed and better, and to anyone reading this, your life is worth more than money. reply",

Unfortunately, most people’s reality force them to consider money. Someone else mentioned to triple your estimate of how long you might be without a job, and sometimes not even that is enough. In the end, it’s mostly about your safety nets. Can you quit, stay 6 months away, and if it turns into 18 months, what then? Can you move back into your parents’? Are you _realistically_ able to take a non-dev job (cashier at McDonalds) just to put food on the table? Nowadays, affording a decent life AND the job not sucking is almost a luxury already. Shouldn’t be that way, and every toxic startup out there is a failure, regardless of their valuation. reply",

The hiring market turned and it took me a long time to get something new once I was ready. Fortunately, I had a significant cushion. Prerequisite to taking up any of my suggestions that follow: \nHow long do you think it would take you to get a new job? Triple that estimate. Can you go that long without pay? If the answer is no, stop reading here. Regarding prepping / searching while working - have you considered dialing back your hours to give yourself more energy for the search? If they don't like it... well, if you are still comfortable with your financial cushion given my first question, then at least you will have made some progress toward your next thing while still getting paid. Another way to assess how you feel about staying: Take at least a week and a half off. Several of my job changes have occurred after some time off. It made the suckitude of the current job so obvious that I quit waffling about it and started looking. reply",

I'm worried about applying to companies that ask for DSA rounds because I can't do standard tests like those and I lose my energy from them. reply",

Of course, you could get fired, but then your manager might get fired for his incompetence. It is a risk. But taking the \"I don't give a F**! FAFO\" attitude makes you feel more in control.

And can you deal with the salary hit (you'll very likely get a new job with a much lower salary)? I quit a few weeks ago – I was being pushed out. It was not fun. I'm still processing how much psychological warfare was really going on and how much I was being gaslit. I was going to do some travelling but I can't stop looking at my budgeting spreadsheet. But luckily it's summer and where I live is quite nice. I'm still in recovery mode. Some health issues have already resolved themselves. I've lost ~8 pounds. I'm sleeping better. What is keeping me sane is that I knew the job, the environment, my colleagues etc was seriously not working and I would have got fired anyway. Luckily my family can help me out a little bit each month, and I'm thinking of getting a housemate, both of which will reduce my burn rate massively. I have enjoyed re-evaluating my spending. It was a bit out of control. I was getting fat eating too much expensive food/takeout etc. I'm cooking more. It feels weird being away from the computer. I feel like I should be learning more AI/interview prep etc. Like every moment not doing that is further damaging my future. Ugh. But I've also massively lost my love for tech. I need to find out if I can rediscover it I wish I had watched a lot more Jordan Peterson etc a year ago. He touches a lot on having a plan, not just giving up, really contemplating the future, explaining poverty isn't fun, analytically working backwards from your problems etc. It's like the advice my father might have given me if I had one. I think I have mental health issues that affected my work, rather than my job being the sole source of all my mental health issues. Ultimately it really is trading one set of stresses and issues for another, I feel. reply",

These are both excellent ways to reduce your living expenses, particularly spreading the cost of housing + utilities over two or more people by sharing a house or an apartment.

          "text": "You need a PLAN.  You probably need a Mentor or a group of friends to talk this out with. Questions you need to answer before quitting: 1) is there anything they can do to keep you - you need to be prepared to answer this, not emotionally but with logic and your sanity in mind 2) is your resume ready?  If not when will it be ready. 3) how do you answer the question: Why did you leave?  The simple answer of 'They were toxic' sounds too much like BS.  It could be interpreted as you are toxic and not willing to see your own problems. 4) are you able to spend 6 months to a year unemployed?  Can you cover all expenses. Including medical. 5) if you are out of work long term, how do you explain what you have been doing?  Best answers are: learning new stuff (with details, possibly a degree), volunteering.  Worst answers: finding yourself, just relaxing, doom scrolling youtube. 6) if you have unemployed friends, set up a group.  See question here where someone was asking how to handle long term unemployment. 7) What are your criteria for the next job.  Clearly not toxic but how are you going to ensure that does not happen.  Prioritize your list.  Having wants is fine.  Having absolutes is fine.  Knowing the difference is critical.  For me, not moving was an absolute until I had been out for 6 months... then I found a job :-) I wish you the best of luck. reply",

          "text": "In my case, it was a mistake. It's very tempting because (I'm guessing) you just want to get out of your current situation ASAP, and of course the final decision is still yours, but this is the advice I would give my past self: - You might not be in the best state of mind right now to make a good decision. I agree with others saying you should take time off, the more the better. Definitely more than one week. - Try going for 1-2 months of time off if possible, even if unpaid. If your country has something like \"leave of absence\" that allows you to take a long period off, like 6 months or more (usually unpaid), but still be able to come back to your company after that period (or at least get priority during hires for the similar position), then try to look into that first, and consider it a \"trial period\" of how well your job search will go. - You might feel good about leaving your job for the first few months, but after that you're running on a time limit. This will be on the back of your mind, and you'll have to learn to live with this worry, and not let it affect your performance on interviews. - You'll get rejected. You'll get ghosted. You might think it's you, and part of it will be because of you, but you don't know which rejections are legit and which ones were just farming your info. This will also take a toll on you, and you will have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. - The more time you've been unemployed, the larger the gap on your resume, the better you'll have to be at explaining that gap in a convincing way. And this is without letting the previous point affect your performance on interviews. - Remember that when you apply for roles, when you reach the last stage (the vibe check), you'll be competing against people with no gap, who might be able to perform better than you if only because they have less worries (no ever-increasing gap, no ever-decreasing money, a rejection for them doesn't affect them too much because they still have a job). - Even if you think you have a good network that could help you get a job quickly, consider their location. Assume you'll only be able to get some help from contacts in your current location (within commute time). Even if you're looking for remote jobs, assume your network will only be able to help, at most, with on-site jobs. - Even if you do freelance work, consider those as part of your employment gap. You might get interviews for companies that don't mind it, but assume that most companies default to treating it as an employment gap. - If you feel bad right now at work, assume that's similar to how bad you'll feel after being unable to get a job for 1 year, but with less money on top of that. And you'll have to learn to not let this affect your performance on interviews. --- That's what I would have liked someone told me before I left my last full-time job. I'm aware I'm just some stranger on the internet exposing how much I suck at life because I wasn't able to just get a job quickly like others, and I underestimated a lot of shit. So I think what I want to say is, \"think carefully\". reply",

          "text": "Documentation is the most valuable if it captures the design decision and intention at the time of the creation of the software, rather than the functionality of the software itself. Its pointless to write \"This function splits the input data into two equally sized chunks, multiplies each chunk with Y and then adds it together\" It makes more sense to write \"The hardware X that this code runs on has a cache size of Y which makes this split necessary for optimal compute throughput\". This provides the next person an understanding of why the code looks as it does, and if it should be changed at this new moment in time, when perhaps new hardware is available. I have seen so many design decisions being forgotten with time, and despite \"documented code\", a new engineer comes in and spends weeks trying to solve something that it inherently correct or is there for a good reason. reply",

          "text": "> you could be dead by next morning I feel like this is often overlooked in financial planning. Everything is aimed at planning for (early) retirement. Meanwhile, the '$1 today is more valuable than $1 tomorrow' trope isn't just true for monetary value, but also for the value $1 might bring. $1 today can buy memories for the rest of your life. It can bring experiences with family members and friends. Having $1 million in the bank in 40 years will never buy back time you may have wasted working to save that money. I'm not saying that people shouldn't save or invest money for the long term, but I do think more people should take into account what they lose today by only focusing on the long term... Especially when that long term might never come. reply",

Another way to look at it is you have time, effort, and savings; you need to balance them all because time will run out.

You can just try out new things temporarily.  Take your sofa example.  If you choose to just try a different arrangement of furniture for a short time, that gives you can opportunity to remember to replace the sofa.  The hard part is being willing to experiment with changes, but I find that it reframes things from fixing an old problem to trying something new, which can be more exciting and motivate additional improvements. reply",

What's the risk that it will actually cost more, considering various ranges of potential numbers (and distributions)? I think it's harder to apply to software since there are more unknowns (or the unknowns are fatter-tailed) but I still liked the book just for the philosophical framing at the beginning: you want to the measure things because they help you make decisions; you don't need perfect measurements since reducing the range of uncertainty is often enough to make the decision. reply",

          "text": "A simple example that highlights the strength of this method: a 137Cs point source is at the origin. A detector consisting of a right cylinder at arbitrary distance and orientation is nearby. What is the solid angle? There may exist an analytical solution for this, but I wouldn't trust myself to derive it correctly. It would certainly be a huge mess. If we add that the source is also a right cylinder instead of point source, and we want to add first order attenuation of emitted gammas by the source itself, the spreadsheet becomes only a bit more complex, but there will not be a pen and paper equation solution. In this example every row of the spreadsheet would represent a hypothetical ray. One could randomly choose a location in the source, a random trajectory, and check if the photon intersects the detector. An alternative approach would be randomly choosing points in both target and detector, then doing additional math. The results are recovered by making histograms and computing stats on the outputs of all the rows. You probably need a few thousand for most things at least. Remember roughly speaking 10k hits gets you ~1% statistics. reply",

          "text": "What annoys me with Monte Carlo methods is trying to get self-consistent statistics at multiple parameter values. E.g., in your example, what is the derivative of the solid angle as the detector is moved? Or more generally, if we have some 'net goodness' measure for a system depending on parameters, how can we efficiently maximize it, when simulations are noisy and basins are shallow? My understanding is that these sorts of questions come up in ML, and there are ways of dealing with it, but they can't converge nearly as fast as simple iterations like Newton's method. Even if I have to take a series approximation instead of a simple formula, I'll be able to use autodiff (or at worst, symbolic differentiation) to get quick and precise answers to these questions. reply",

I've only been able to get access from places with subscriptions. Some university libraries allow visitors where you can use these databases for free on-site. I would call these databases complementary, not \"entirely superior\". There are two main advantages. One is that these databases will contain many things that you can't find on Google. The second advantage of these databases is that they are designed for advanced searchers and have more powerful query languages. Google on the other hand is dumbed down and will try to guess what you want, often doing a poor job. You can get very specific on these databases in ways that you can't with Google. Related: I'm somewhat fascinated by more specialized bibliographic databases because they often contain things that can't be found on Google or the major commercial databases I listed above.

It's easy to say that quick-and-dirty is just dirty, and it's true: in the long run, quick-and-dirty takes longer than the-right-thing. But, there is a but: time doesn't always have the same value! Time just before a deadline is much more precious than the time after the deadline, when you can relax a bit and fix things before the next stress wave.

Hardcode the list.  Make it hard fail if something is missing or something is added.  Yeah, it is more work, but the madness it prevents is worthwhile. there are probably thousands of these things.

If poor decisions were being made, or taking too long, I’d use my skills to gather data, then worked to get better at presenting that data in ways that would matter to the people who needed to make these decision, so the choice became more obvious. I’m not a data scientist by trade, but ended up spending a lot of time with data to help drive decision to move the ball forward in the areas I felt needed to move forward. But of course, any sufficiently large company is going to have some level of bureaucracy that slows things down. It’s the nature of the beast. I found side projects helped for this. I’ve had one long-running side project at work for over 10 years now. Whenever things are moving slow and I’m waiting, or I just need to tinker and learn something new, that’s where I go. It’s useful for the company, it has a few hundred internal users, most probably don’t even know who I am, but it mostly exists as a place for me to tinker. reply",

In my experience the people who keep learning and progressing professionally when their day job isn't pushing them are intrinsically motivated and simply do this on their own. They find things to learn and they find ways to progress professionally. They identify skills they lack and get them. They have ideas and follow them through. I think you have to figure out whether you are one of those people right now or not. It's fine to not be (you can always change in the future) but at least you can stop worrying about it. reply",

I noticed they had an open position in exactly the team responsible for the implementation and applied. A few months later I received a rejection. The letter said that the team doesn't have the time to review any more candidates. The code is under MIT so everything is perfectly fine. It is great that a company like Anthropic is using my code, but it would have been nice to benefit from it.

This approach would be \"necessary\" (for some definition of necessary) for GPL code, but isn't necessary for MIT code. [1] this assumes there's 1 (or nearly 1) copyright owner. If there are multiple contributors, and no CUA in place, this approach is generally not possible. Personally, and different people have strong feelings on this both ways, with GPL code I'd get contributors to sign a CUA.

After 20 years of working on FOSS projects, I've invested enormous amounts of time, effort, and money into these and other free/open-source initiatives.

You keep going because it feels good and you develop a sense of moral superiority.\nBut years later, when the people closest to you are no longer around - you pause and reflect on how much energy you devoted to random strangers instead of those who shared your life. If I had invested even 1% of the time and effort I put into FOSS projects into my relationships with loved ones, they would have been so much happier.

          "text": "This is of course a terrible reply to receive, I'm sorry you got that. But I also find the psychology behind this sort of reply interesting, because there's lots of factors that lead to this sort of extreme. Firstly, we don't know the age of the replier, but my guess would be someone also young, or at least immature. Telling people to kill themselves is not something adults typically do in any context.) So it suggests another junior, desperate to prove their own standing, and needing to compete against others rather than collaborate. I've seen this kind of response in one adult (abusive to other forum members) but he clearly had quite severe mental health issues (and the user was banned.) In youngsters it is usually extinguished with firm moderator guidance. With adult responders, frustration and tedium play a role. Personally I'm more generous with replies in the morning than the evening. At times I almost \"fake\" patience (when I'm getting impatient) with people who are simply not thinking, and who aren't listening. Overall it is very imbalanced. The asker is asking 1 question. The replier may answer tens or hundreds in a day. So it's hard to answer each one as if it's original, as if it matters, as if you've not heard it a million times before (especially if it's right there in the FAQ.) Part of answering well, and the quality of any forum, is in participants answering well, even if the question is trivial. We all were newbies once. Asking stupid questions is how we grew from there. Answering stupid questions is how we pay it forward. reply",

          "text": "So, I definitely believe this story 100%: when I was on the anglosphere Internet in 200x, there was a lot of elitism and hazing rituals of sorts, among other things. It was a very real and unfortunate thing that coincided the otherwise excellent experiences (IMO) of being online at that time. Still, I really don't think most people need to be told not to tell other people to kill themselves, and in many places where I hung out when I was younger I strongly believe you would have been tempbanned for \"flaming\". I was a forum moderator and I can tell you I would not have hesitated. But you said the magic words, so it bears addressing; I think we all get the picture that the Code of Conduct drama usually doesn't have much to do with the actual rules that are contained within, which really aren't that controversial on their face, but rather the way in which power is moved from stakeholders within a project to other people by virtue of initiatives like establishing Code of Conducts and the governance structures that enforce them. And, I think most people will probably not get upset over the idea that telling someone else to go kill themselves might get you suspended from a discussion forum... Rather, the drama comes in when you see the reach of a project or organization's CoC start to extend outward past what people actually want to stop (toxic, unproductive communication) and past the edges of the project (and into policing the rest of the Internet.) Two notable examples I'd cite are Python with Tim Peters (who as far as anyone can tell genuinely didn't do anything wrong) and Freedesktop.org with Vaxry (who can be a bit immature, but is primarily accused of not moderating the Hyprland Discord... Which is a fair complaint about the Hyprland Discord, but not a very good reason for him to be banned from Freedesktop.org.) Of course, truthfully, there is no 100% winning answer here; if the stakeholders who have control over a project by virtue of being the original developers don't want to cede any control to people for CoC enforcement, they don't really have to (although in reality, external pressures to implement one might make it an untenable position to hold.) In that case, you have to rely on those people to hold themselves accountable to reasonable conduct, and nobody's perfect. It's kind of like when police departments conduct internal investigations and find no problems; even if you're pretty pro-police, you must feel somewhat skeptical that they actually were reasonably impartial in conducting said investigation. But, I generally side with The Evil I Know, which is that the project authors and biggest stakeholders should generally maintain most of the power and control in an open source project including the ultimate decisions regarding moderation. In cases where developers have proven particularly egregious with their conduct, forking has proven to be effective enough as a mitigation strategy, and the fact that it comes at a cost is a sort of feature, as it's better if a power shift like that isn't easy; while I can't guarantee that the original authors and maintainers of a project will act reasonably and impartially, I can at least say that I expect them to have the project's best interests at heart, whereas the kinds of people that go around looking for established projects and organizations to join roles that have authority tend to not be the kinds of people you usually want in those roles. Having it be difficult means you need people who genuinely care about the project rather than the types of people who just kind of seek power. (And I am sorry, but there are fuckloads of those people among us and they are absolutely dirty enough to hide under the guise of anything to get a modicum of control. Running an online community for any appreciable amount of time opens your eyes to this IMO.) All of this to say, it reflects poorly on the state of the Internet at the time and KDE's mailing lists that the situation happened and was possibly not rectified in a way that is satisfactory (it sure doesn't sound like it.) The correct thing to do is obviously to issue a ban, and you don't need a rule book of any kind to figure that out. I think when people push for these things during major incidents, it's misguided at best, because usually the core problem was not that a \"don't tell people to kill each other\" rule didn't exist, but that people actually would've needed such a rule to decide the behavior was unacceptable in the first place. This isn't some complex gray area case. I don't think people are acting in bad faith when they suggest it as an option after a drama incident, but I still think it's the wrong knee jerk 99% of the time. (The most favorable thing I can say is that I think a CoC might possibly have value in very large projects like Linux or Kubernetes, but so far the execution has always felt like it leaves something to be desired. Seeing people occasionally openly threaten to contact the CoC committees over effectively technical disagreements leaves a bad taste in my mouth.) reply",

I've tried keeping the console open and reading through the AI agent process but that gets me nervous after a few interactions.<p>I also don't enjoy it as much. I don't get the feeling of accomplishment after finishing a new feature and everything feels fragmented.<p>Even using multiple sessions doesn't do the trick for me because I need to change task context every time. Does this happen to anyone else? Any recommendations?<p>How do you think we can achieve flow state while in this transition period while AI coding still needs constant hand holding and reviews?</p></p></p></p></div>",

But my day to day is about working with already existing code which I have to modify and here, AI is exactly the opposite : it helps me drill down boring and legacy code. I helps me stay in the flow because I can ask questions about the code. I can ask it where is the code that does X, I can ask it how it currently works. I can describe my issue, let it analyze the code and ask it to make proposals to solve my issue. Then I discuss the options, then I let it implement the one \"we\" agreed upon, then I review and I discuss the solution. In fact I stay in flow because I don't feel alone with my issues and my questions. Maybe it says more about my work environment where I cannot pair as much as I wanted to but at least I have Cursor/Claude/Whatever. However not having that continuous interaction and hoping the AI to solve your Jira ticket in one prompt is going to be a disaster for your focus and you will not trust the result enough. Overall, it makes my job less miserable when I'm doing boring things. reply",

          "text": "Development experience of AI tools is becoming the biggest blocker. And a large part of that is performance (in time, not qualitatively). Most of us are doing relatively simple things like using with the largest/slowest models possible instead of downgrading to a smaller model. Reason: our tools lack the ability to escalate to more expensive models as needed and switching models manually is tedious. Ideally, a cheap locally running model would be first in line and respond quickly for quick things. And then there's the whole asynchronous vs. synchronous thing. With Codex, it runs in a browser and it allows you to create a pull request whenever it is done. You can work on multiple pull requests with it even and it might work in parallel. What's good about the Codex experience is that your input is only needed at the end. What's bad is that it takes ages. Even for simple stuff. Like a simple follow up question results in it boiling the oceans to startup the container again. Slow AI is exactly like slow builds: frustrating and likely to distract you. If it's going to take a minute you are going to do something else. And that might not be work related. So it breaks your flow because you are sitting on your hands and filling your short term memory with garbage. Context switches are expensive (and break flow). Our brains don't do that well. And then you forget to switch back so you lose time. I don't use reasoning models that much for this reason. It's easier and faster for me to manually patch up my code with whatever the LLM says I should fix. And on larger repositories the chance of a good PR drops sharply. So, even if it takes more context micromanagement to feed it all the detail it needs, this can be faster and more effective. And I get an answer in a few seconds instead of in a few minutes. reply",

          "text": "For me, it's not just boredom, it's missing the little thrills. When I have a project that has tons of forms that require complex validation, it's the little thrill of thinking of a way to do it that saves time and is reusable. Maybe I'll create a js proxy object and a generic \"change\" event handler. In the \"change\" I'll assign a value to the proxy that's the name of the form component. Maybe this proxy object is smart enough to issue batches of JSONPatch mutations to the server, that handles validation biz logic etc... so I end up with this neat, elegant little solution to a tedious problem. I get a thrill of satisfaction when it all works great, and the joy of problem solving to create and debug it. Exactly zero out of a million runs would an AI come up with something like that. It's a stochastic parrot. But it'll happily chug along and generate 10,000 lines of repetitive forms code that mostly work, and done in the most tedious way imaginable. But I guess it's more \"productive\" than me. Each time I run in to a tedious or boring problem, I take joy in pushing the boundaries of my understanding to come up with a better way of solving it. AI coding kills that completely. reply",

Like I'm able to rely on a team of devs for busywork and just deciding to do it by hand and overcharge my clients (in time). I've had a few instances where I've been able to go into flow state with 3 concurrent sessions on fully disjoint projects. Feels like context switching is easier when there's almost zero cognitive overlap between the projects in terms of actual features, but the stacks are all similar. But for sure I haven't even come closer to these glorious flow sessions fully locked into coding some clever bit of logic. So, here for the suggestions too. reply",

I love building things, trying things, finding the best result that checks all the boxes, conventions, quality, etc. Not having to hand set the code is a pure net positive for me. I can discuss architecture, interfaces, data flow, data models and so on, I can let it quickly onboard me, tell me where we left of. It's great.

Personally, my experience has been the best with doing this: - Start coding - On a second laptop, run an agent in yolo and tell it to periodically pull changes and if there are any `AGENT-TODO:` items in the code, do them. - As you code, if you find something irritating or boring, `AGENT-TODO: ...` it. - Periodically push your changes. - Periodically pull any changes your agent has pushed down. - Keep working; don't stop and check on the agent. Don't confirm every action. Just yolo. If that's too scary, have it put up PRs instead of pushing to the live branch. /shrug ...but, tldr: if you're sitting there watching an agent do things, you're not in flow. If you're kicking multiple agents off and sitting waiting for them, you're more productive , but that is absolutely not flow state. Anyone who thinks they are, doesn't know what flow state is. The key to maintaining flow is having a second clone, or a second machine or something where you can keep doing work after you kick the agent off to do something. (yeah, you don't need a second laptop, but it's nice; agents will often run things to check they work or steal ports or run tests that can screw with you if you're on the same machine) reply",

He didn't exactly say, but either it was either too expensive to be worth it, or too risky to be worth it, or too little result to be worth it.  Yeah, that's his opinion, but he's paid to have medical opinions, and is much more qualified to have them than I am.

          "text": "I've seen two doctors who took a look at my eyes and said everything's healthy, and that I'm just experiencing age-related presbyopia (I'm 43m). My symptoms are as follows: * My eyes become dry very quickly if they are open at a normal width. * Due to the above, I spend much of the day with my eyes in a fairly squinted configuration. * I cannot read, eg, text on my phone without squinting. * Covering one eye (particularly my left eye) seems to improve my vision. * My eyes often hurt / burn, especially in the evening. * I have gnarly floaters in my left eye. * Reading glasses are not much help; in order to benefit from them, I need to open my eyes more, which makes them very dry within 60 seconds. * My eyes are often red and cloudy, especially in the morning. * I occasionally wake up during the night from pain / dryness in my eyes. * Unlike what I understand is typical for presbyopia, my vision does not degrade throughout the day, and is often a bit better at night. Observations about things that have changed this: * Sub-freezing temps seem to bring about a fairly fast (ie, within 1-2 days) and dramatic relief.  Each year for the past few, I've gone to Colorado in mid-Feb for three weeks or so, and these are the best vision weeks of the year.  However, I spend much of my time in Florida, so I rarely encounter cold temps. * The drops that the doctor puts in to dilate pupils seem to trigger dramatic improvement, lasting 1-2 days. * Spending time outside and using an RLCD monitor in the sun does seem to bring about some pain relief, but even multiple days in a row of this don't seem to improve my up-close vision or eye dryness. I've tried searching every term I can think of, and as I say, I've seen multiple doctors (though I'm happy to go again).  If anybody has any insight, I'd really value it.  I'm struggling with this. reply",

I reside Thousand Oaks, Ca with my beautiful wife of almost 15yrs and 3 children. I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs. As a former professional athlete, I am looking to join a team where teamwork is paramount and opportunities for growth and learning from others are a daily occurrence. I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding.

Now I'm looking to help another technical product become more human. What I deliver (bringing 10 years of indie puzzle gaming insights to software): * Tutorial thinking - Design onboarding where users learn by doing, not reading docs * Progressive complexity - Reveal features as users are ready, not all at once * Intrinsic motivation - Create products people use because they want to, not have to * Discovery moments - Build \"aha!\" experiences into routine workflows * Natural sharing - Design features worth showing off (no forced virality) * Satisfaction loops - Make the 100th use as rewarding as the first Previously: SpicyNodes (40M users), time.gov (2M monthly), medical AI for 1.5M patients. PI on $295K NSF SBIR. I excel at the intersection of technical depth and human understanding - whether building atomic clock interfaces or language models. Seeking: VP Product or CPO role at companies building AI products. Particularly interested in semantic search, knowledge tools, or creative AI applications. I lead teams of creative and technical people, and leverage those same skills to architect and ship production code (Swift, Python, etc.) via modern AI tools - decades of managing developers taught me exactly how to direct technical work.

Data extraction and massage, delivery to destinations like Google/Meta/TikTok/etc. Profitable, 15+ yrs stable, 100% employee-owned. No VC, no pointless meetings, just serious coding. Stack : Python/Django, JavaScript, VueJS, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Docker, Git, AWS, AI/LLM integrations (OpenAI & Gemini). Compensation : $150K–$250K USD/year DOE. You : Senior dev who's seen (and fixed) enough dumpster-fire code to last a lifetime. Python/Django deeply internalized; ideally strong Vue (or React) skills. Git/Docker/REST are second nature. You’re the coder other devs come to when their stuff breaks: an architect-level thinker who’s rewritten ‘clever’ code into something that actually works. You play well with others and write code that’s easy to live with. Bonus: AI integrations, Py2→Py3 migrations, Snowflake (or Databricks) experience. Timezones : VersaFeed's \"core\" time zone is PST and we have M/W/F standups at 9AM PST. Otherwise, we are async-friendly and welcome US and EU applicants. Benefits : 401K match (USA), healthcare, equity, fully remote. Stable company with no time-wasters. Apply : email jobs+hn253 [the-at-mark-thing] versafeed [the-period-thing] com reply",

The job is classical — mostly building web portals — but those portals open into the quantum world. Quantum computing knowledge is a plus, but not required. The initial project is a platform to understand the trajectory of quantum computing. The focus is on data visualization, so strong skills in that area are preferred. The candidate will work mostly alongside quantum engineers and researchers, so ownership to work independently on the classical side of things is important.

We build a wallet and digital asset API that over a thousand companies integrate in order to onboard (75M+) users onto products built with blockchain infra and distributed systems. We solve hard product design and security problems in order to shift the status quo around digital ownership and protect the accounts and assets of millions of users. With our work, we stand to transform how users think about asset ownership and money movement online. We're a small, high-ownership team building a product with incredibly scaled usage (>12M MAUs, massive transaction volume). We were recently acquired by Stripe — while we'll remain an autonomous team and stand alone product, joining Stripe will help significantly accelerate our growth and impact. https://www.privy.io/careers#open-positions reply",

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have >1000 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We just raised a $50M Series A and are now expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to seasoned backend, data and infrastructure engineers. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

          "text": "Solace Health | Full-Stack | Remote (US Only) I realize it's hard to tell these days what jobs are \"real\" but make no mistake - we're hiring aggressively. About Solace: The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. We're a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces...

Explaining a project's vision or goals give my brain a mini-version of the feeling of accomplishment of actually doing it, and I found that I would use that as a replacement for actually building stuff (which is much more work). Instead, if I only talk about the parts that I've completed, it's very motivating to build the next step so that I can share it. It also gave me more flexibility to change course during a project. reply",

Right now my current \"project\" is building a stock of photos so that I can post a continuous stream of photos on social https://mastodon.social/@UP8/tagged/photography This is pretty consuming because my developing process is intensive.  I took about 3500 photos of two basketball games on Jan 31 and picked out about 400 to develop in DxO,  I chose one color grade for all of them because a lot of the girls had bad acne that I wanted to minimize,  now I am cropping them and applying local microcontrast to the parts in focus (but not faces of athletes with acne)  I expect this take a few evenings,  then there are many more batches of photos to develop including other games as well as tranches of flowers and landscapes.  I have probably 15k undeveloped photos where those came from. Another stream of that work is building an autoposter which will make it easier to keep these coming,  for a while I was posting to Mastodon + Bluesky but lately I am posting to Facebook and LinkedIn,  want to add Instagram (hate the UI for uploading) and Threads and anything else I can.  That's blocked by my work to finish my Python API for using Postgres as an arangodb-like document database which blocks a whole bunch of projects that both involve moving forward,  like a general purpose trainer for text classification and getting YOShInOn (my RSS reader) off arangodb.

I’ve been using Kanban control for side projects since maybe 3-4 years ago when I started doing side projects again.  At the beginning of the year I had a lot of projects that were more programming heavy like I wrote a Python chess program that could beat my son that didn’t have time control, I did some work towards a Java chess program which would have had time control so we could take it to the chess club but my son quit going to chess club so I mothballed it. The photo thing is converging towards transitioning from semi-pro to pro,  figuring building my rep as a ‘social media photographer’ will get me work.  I have other imaging projects in mind such as something to view stereograms with WebXR and something that can compose individual flowers to make ‘infinite flower fields’ that could be printed on fabrics but these are at the ‘pile of notes” phase waiting their turns. reply",

I saw a startup school video that basically said you should Launch and then Launch again and Launch again, and again and again... I quit making a side project and then launching it. I just sat down and wrote out a launch list. One of those items was to make the thing useable. Some might claim this is like MVP idea. but that's a whole other thing. This \"Always Be Launching\" is really wrapping the product up in the hype from the outset. I've started to do things like just email my list and explain that I'm considering making something. what questions or concerns would they have about it.  And I consistently ask my email list if there's something I can improve about something I already launched. The Book Launch by Jeff Walker helped put into plain terms the actual questions and how I go about pre-launching something I haven't made yet. It's helped me build about three or five new courses very confidently because I had been asked a bunch of questions from people who would go on to take that course. reply",

They don't need necessarily need to hold you to your commitments but just the idea of telling them what you're trying to focus on helps tremendously.  Currently, not having anyone yet having moved recently.  Using my therapist ;-)    One thing I found; the \"co-conspirator\" does not need to be a subject matter expect to any level.  Just someone who's willing to listen is key. Here are things I tried to do: 1. Having a sounding \"board\" person.\n   2. Taking only 5sec to help you decide.\n   3. Post-it the thought/idea/notion all over the house to make focus.\n   4. Talking it through to yourself.  Using yourself in a 2/3rd person. Maybe yet another AI focused idea to solely help you stay focused and on task. I need all of this... reply",

My question is what hardware setup would you buy, that is reasonable accessible (say under 5k, ideally well under) and can do a good job running the models for local queries. And, if it matters, could be suitable for archiving, say until either there is a substantial advance rendering today's LLMs obsolete or until needed because good, open weights aren't available anymore.</div>",

You don't have to worry about \"future access changes\" too much, OpenAI knows there is no \"undo\" button once they publish weights. The real issue is having SOTA, collapse-proof hardware for inference. Apple and Nvidia hardware are both reliant on drivers that can brick your server with an over-the-air update. AMD hardware has generally more resilient Mesa drivers that can theoretically survive a hostile OEM, but with fewer options for finetuning and training. Intel GPUs are a high-VRAM option but it's unclear how long they'll be supported in-software for. Everything is a system of tradeoffs. reply",
