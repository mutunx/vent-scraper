          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\". I think for one of them we managed to get a few thousand or something from someone's employer to cover some costs. But \"sponsorship\" would be a strong word.

The actual technical side was never that impressive or interesting. One community that kicks ass at this are InfoSec people, I've done a lot of terrific volunteer-run CTFs. reply",

          "text": "Hack the hackathon. My follow-at-your-own-risk pro tip: Find a team not too much into wining and - connect with others. They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice.

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP).

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

          "text": "I haven't been to a hackathon in a long time, but the best ones I remember were explicitly about getting designers and developers to build something concrete but simple for a good cause. I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing.

At the end there was a big presentation that anyone in the company could attend and each team would present what they came up with. Some of them eventually became products directly, or at least set the groundwork for future products.

They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

The hackathons I remember as a college student were different. They were much more free form. You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box.

And I have had the same sentiment in the quantum computing space as well and thinking through the reason for it, my sense is that 24-48 hours is not enough time to build something meaningful. This is not to say that absolutely cannot be done, but the chances of something cool being made are generally low. My guess is that this idea might hold in general, anything that can be built really quickly tends not to be too impressive and all impressive things tend to take longer.\nI have gotten to a point where, if I see something impressive, I have this nagging feeling, Was this completed here? or were you working on this for a decent amount of time and just took this opportunity to showcase it? reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

To quote one girl: \"Bro, my backend is just stateless Ollama calls and prompt templates. I could one-shot this garbage while hammered.\" So, yes, they do feel fake. There's no challenge.

No idea what are the social cues that led them to this, but I would find that interesting to study. I don't think they're ill intentioned, I think they don't consider lying to be bad and it's some sort of way of going through life. Not long ago I was having dinner w/ some scammers (one of them is on the latest YC batch, btw) and this guy was telling everybody that you need to lie to get ahead, \"if you don't lie to your investors they will invest in someone else who is lying to them\".

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

There's an extensive amount of brush, leaves, etc of varying ages that could maybe be shredded up into something useful, invasive vines I'm still trying to deal with, and more old trash than I've fully figured out how to properly dispose of. It's turning into various DIY rabbit holes, actually, with the next one (outside of various related landscaping stuff) being to gut a basement. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

A lot of these trees done by tree care companies in residential or commercial areas are also sprawling hardwood trees like oaks that can't always be safely just dropped from the ground even if there's a clear area to drop it in.

On top of that, it uses a lightweight AI model to read product descriptions and filter based on things like ingredients (e.g., flagging peanut butter with BPA by checking every photograph of the plastic or avoiding palm oil by reading the nutrition facts) or brand lists (e.g., only showing WSAVA-compliant dog foods).

Anyway, Costco didn't always win, but in my experience, they frequently did -- $5 peanut butter @ Costco vs $7.74 @ Target based on whatever size and brand I got, which is interesting because Costco doesn't have \"generic\" PB, whereas Target has much cheaper Market Pantry, and I tried to opt for that. reply",

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience.

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end. Also, in my free time, I learn and share my knowledge by writing blogs, newsletters, Youtube videos, or speaking at conferences. reply",

I spent the early part of my career at early stage startups and have spent the past 8 years or so doing mostly greenfield projects on a contract basis. I've done a lot in the dev tools space, and with graphically intensive web applications (e.g. domain-specific CAD tools). I'm working on some LLM infrastructure tooling that I designed and have partly built that I plan to commercialize so I'm looking for something pretty part time. I think I could be very useful on the right project, but I also have a lot of constraints on what I'm looking for (part-time, could be AI-related but won't sign restrictive contracts in that space). For a person/team that can be flexible on this kind of stuff definitely reach out, happy to talk! I'll consult for reasonable rates too if you want advice/second opinion/ideas/approaches for building AI products. reply",

I’ve worked on problems like reinforcement learning for tumor landmark detection in MRI, and deep learning for physical systems and protein structure prediction. I like forming own ideas and following them through — from literature review to implementation, evaluation, and iteration. I can reproduce papers, fine-tune models, explore new methods, and design experiments that actually test hypotheses. I’m especially motivated by early-stage work that blends research thinking with practical engineering. In team settings, I tend to gravitate toward coordination and planning roles, and outside of work, I’ve led a 300+ member volleyball department for several years — which taught me how to manage people, not just models. I'm looking for roles at the intersection of research and engineering, eg early-stage AI projects where curiosity, ownership, technical depth matter and impact-driven development are valued. reply",

          "text": "About My core focus is solving real business problems QUICKLY and AFFORDABLY in a way that's easy to enhance and extend. Whether you need to streamline operations, replace outdated systems, or build something new, I deliver practical solutions quickly without cutting corners. About Me I've been building software systems professionally since the mid-90s, working across industries like finance, payments, scientific research, mil-spec, and telecoms. For most of the past 25 years, I focused on embedded systems, though I still take on the occasional eBPF or IoT project for select clients. These days, I prefer developing Line-of-Business (LoB) applications for SMEs; the faster turnaround and immediate impact make it especially rewarding. What I Deliver I specialize in building Line-of-Business web-applications tailored to SMEs, using a lean proprietary low-code technology stack. For most projects, I deliver functional, reliable apps in 4-6 weeks; a typical project costs around $5000 USD as a one-time fee. I also accommodate clients who prefer a monthly subscription model (yes, SaaS habits are hard to break). What makes me faster and more cost-effective? I've developed a proprietary framework that accelerates development while allowing rapid, low-code-style enhancements. Clients receive full source code with a non-redistribution license, ensuring they can extend or maintain their solution without being locked into ongoing contracts. If you need a Line-of-Business app done fast and affordably, without sacrificing quality, I'll quickly give you a very good idea of cost for your intended scope.

In addition to strong programming and architectural skills, I'm a force multiplier for any team through the three T's -- teaching, talking, and tooling. In the past, I've led teams of up to 12, managed interview pipelines, pioneered a number of no- and low-code solutions for all of the following -- stream processing, data model, query generation, form building, workflow systems, and front-end construction -- for a variety of industries, including those with strong regulatory requirements and complex business rules such as healthcare and fintech. More recently, I've built a no-code form-filler and a workflow engine for coordinating LLMs and other generative AI processes, and on top of this a platform for both minimizing hallucinations and working with documents that are far too large for existing context window outputs using a novel, patent-pending process. I am also an improvisational pianist and distinguished poet.

          "text": "Location: New York City Remote: Sure, but my preference is in-office. Willing to relocate: No Technologies: JAX, PyTorch, Machine learning in general, Python, Rust Resume: https://www.echonolan.net/resume/cv.pdf Email: echo@echonolan.net I'm an ML engineer/research engineer looking for work in that vein. I can train models, I can design architectures, I can implement papers, I can gather real and synthetic data, and I can in general solve the problems that come up when trying to build ML systems. Background: I recently ended a 3 month contract at Redwood Research doing AI safety research where I spent about half my time improving our synthetic data pipelines and about half finetuning LLMs to exhibit unsafe behavior in deployment but not training, and to do so while defeating probes trained to detect the unsafe behavior (but only in deployment). I also have an ongoing solo research project working on text-to-image models trained without any text, relying on embeddings for conditioning. [1] is a (very out of date) blog post about that. There'll be a paper soon inshallah. Before the ML stuff I worked at a startup where we built a new cryptocurrency, and before that another startup.

          "text": "Sarama | Canine Language Specialist | On-site (San Francisco, CA) | Full Time | Must have a dog | praful@sarama.ai Company: We’re building smart collars and devices to decode dog communication—using audio, motion, and behavior data. Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift!

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

Our primary technical bet is that if you capture annotated \"diffs\" of user information with the appropriate annotation, you can create path-dependence to train AI models in an AlphaGo like context. By doing so, we achieve agentic experiences for markets that have never even had an opportunity to imagine what life would be like with basic observability. Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal/regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities. We're in stealth, but recently venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market. We're hiring for a few roles at the senior/staff levels:\n1. HCI Engineer - You're a prosemirror wizard who probably follows Ink & Switch or the UCSB HCI lab on Twitter; front-end/rich-text/typescript focused; lots of architectural/sync engine work\n2. Systems/Compiler Engineer - We design and build dev tools for languages we create that compile into various graph representations. These range from financial modeling calcs (which need to go very fast to support a seamless UX), to computable representations of legal agreements. Extra points if you've worked with hypergraphs. This in Rust but we're exploring a few other languages. Email resume/linkedin/twitter to oliver@phosphor.co if you might fit somewhere in here, or if you've taken a credible attempt at building end-user programming tools. reply",

I wanted to check out at 4PM, not have to think about work after that, and do whatever I wanted. Since making this decision I've become an expert in a number of hobbies, gotten married, had kids, and am now living a quite pleasant life. The financial freedom people aim for in retirement, the time, I have that already. I'm already living a care-free life, largely doing what I want. I have a family member who is a multi-millionaire and who owns multiple businesses. He has more money now than I'll have in my lifetime. But I have something that he doesn't have - time. In my estimation time is a much more valuable commodity to obtain than money. If you can work your career so you have enough money, but also time, that's a more valuable goal than simply 'being rich'. Money with no free time and boat load of stress is a shit life. reply",

          "text": "As someone who eventually 'got rich' (to a very comfortable FatFIRE level) after decades of high-tech startup entrepreneurship across three startups and over a dozen new products, my primary objective was never \"get rich\". It was to earn a good living, making cool things, in ways I found interesting, in collaboration with people I liked, for customers I liked ( <--- that last part is important ). While I knew making better-than-good money was always a possibility, it was never the deciding factor in choosing what to do, how to do it, who to do it with or for. > trying to come up with multi-million dollar ideas In my experience, starting with that mindset is unlikely to work - and worse, its focusing on the wrong thing. If you can see the multi-million dollar idea - so can other people, including competitors with more money and momentum than a new startup. I approached it differently. The general pattern which had the best success rate for me was applying a new technology (or old tech in a new way) which I found intriguing or cool to solve a real-world problem in a new or different way that was both better and cheaper than existing solutions. One important element was validating very early on that this problem actually existed and was important (ie high-value) to real potential customers. This meant actually meeting these people and sharing a non-functioning demo or conceptual prototype able to get them interested enough to want to test prototypes as the product evolved. If your non-functioning solution demo doesn't get real potential customers almost pleading to get in the beta - then you don't yet have the right problem, solution or customer. Developing solutions to solve real problems for real people whose names, needs and preferences we already knew made development both easier AND a lot more fun. It kept us focused and grounded in ways that were transformative. Note: I didn't say there had to be a million customers with a validated TAM of zillions of dollars. Just a handful of real customers in enough need to want to spend their limited time guiding some startup's non-existent product into existence. They're not doing it because they're nice, they're doing it because they're not happy with what they've got and want to ensure your solution arrives in a form able to solve their problem. I never spent a lot of time validating there was a huge market beyond the first pool of customers. I felt okay as long as there was plausible evidence of some reasonably sizable number of customers beyond our handful of \"new best friend\" customers. Doing it this way ensured we'd make some number of early adopters delighted as well as there being a high probability of at least enough early customers for a two-pizza-sized company to survive for a while. While this was no guarantee of eventual riches, it did help ensure we were making something of real immediate value for at least some real customers who'd pay for our solution - and that alone put us past about >80% of the early issues that kill startups. The \"riches\" possibility is innate because once you're successfully applying an interesting new technology in new ways to solve a real problem that at least some real customers will pay real money for - there's probably at least a 10% - 20% chance you're one pivot (or less) away from an emerging new market you can be on (or close) to the ground floor of. So - once you're nearing first delivery to your \"new best friend\" customers, start keeping your eyes peeled for that emerging opportunity that's somewhere nearby in the same or an adjacent market. If it's not there, you've still got a lifestyle-sized business that's either breaking even or close to it, and that alone provides options. You can decide there's potential and work toward turning that break even into profit and growth or you can pivot to something adjacent with the benefit of some cash flow, real customers and the momentum of a shipping team. And that alone tends to get the attention of all the VCs who previously wouldn't return your calls. > I hate the business side... actually figuring out how to make money... That's the hard part. I doubt you'll be able to make it as a tech startup entrepreneur until you re-frame that. I used to jokingly say \"If you solve a present and painful problem for your customers, it's hard to get them to stop throwing money at you.\" While an exaggeration, there's serious truth there. As for making money, until you find engineering a business model that actually works just as fascinating as engineering any other machine into actually fucking working - you'll suck at doing it and keep hating it. If you don't see a 'business model' as just another interesting, tangible and tractable engineering problem to be instrumented, debugged and solved - you'll probably have a better time working for other people. > I like building stuff with my friends Okay, when you guys are done playing with yourselves, maybe try playing with someone else... or, even better, for someone else. Like real customers. Helping nice people in real need is way more interesting, challenging and emotionally rewarding than playing with yourselves. And having an audience who's invested in the quality of your performance is a wonderful way stay grounded in what matters. I got into this as a 20 year-old introvert who liked nerding around with computers, but on the journey I ended up meeting nice people with interesting problems and discovered I kind of liked using my nerd powers to 'save them' from the shitty, costly or annoying problem making part of their day miserable. Give it a try. Frankly, if solving interesting problems in cool ways for nice people doesn't light up some chunk of neurons in your skull, then maybe entrepreneurship isn't for you. Bottom line, the way I eventually managed to \"get rich\" was by not trying to get rich. Instead, I changed my definition of success to: having fun with my friends solving real problems in technically interesting ways for real customers we liked. I emotionally came to peace with the reality that, if all I managed to do was solve problems for enough people to pay our rent and bills with a few bucks left over - that alone was enough. Not only enough to be worth doing but enough to be morally and ethically \"Good\". Sure, more financial upside would be nice if it happened but, the reality is, some of that will always be out of our control. Your post sounds like you're basically giving up on playing the tech startup game. Before you do, at least consider there may be ways to redefine the game so that it matters to more people than you and your friends, so that money is not the only metric and so that \"winning\" is mostly within your control. reply",

Correct. I'm still open to working for startups, but as far as coming up with my own ideas, I've accepted it's probably not going to happen. I still plan on making some side projects, working on an open source game now, and I've written a script ( probably going to switch it to a short graphical novel I can self fund). I definitely will revisit your comment in the future, I think you've just provided a full semester of Business School in a few paragraphs. What I take from this is I need to find the tools that people want, and actually build those instead of building tools and then telling people how amazing and great they are. I think the next big B2B opportunity would be something like Pivotal Tracker / Jira , but with intelligent LLM generated summaries of what each team member is working on. As well as the option to assign small scale tickets to code agents which would either write the code or at a minimum create a branch with the methods stubbed out. I don't really think I have the capital to do this personally. But hypothetically if I did, I'd build a POC and then offer it to members of my game dev group. Or maybe I should just go down to this one bar where I know a lot of old school business folks hang out. These are men and women with relatively high net worths, and just ask straight up what problems they'd liked solved. Do you have any suggestions for books on your business philosophy ? I might have free time in a few months. reply",

          "text": "In IT there are three highly generalized routes to consider: * Low barrier of entry jobs, like most web developer jobs. Good luck, it’s a race to the bottom but it’s also where most of the jobs are. The goal here is to pad your resume with nonsense and compete with hundreds of other people that are also padding their resumes. * Jobs that require licenses and/or certifications. These will be jobs like cloud infrastructure support, cyber defense, routing/switching, project management, and operations. These jobs are harder to qualify for and are fewer than the prior bullet point but are a much safer bet and tend to pay more. * High talent jobs, which include the gaming industry and more engineering type jobs. These jobs are the fewest and not as secure as the prior category. They also are the most variable in compensation, but they tend to be the most fulfilling for people with high intelligence or high creativity. Know which way you want to go because the means to achieve these jobs differ radically. reply",

          "text": "Check out Nim. I'm using it to build an x86-64 kernel¹ (Fusion OS), and it satisfies a lot of the low-level system programming requirements with an elegant and expressive syntax. For memory management you can choose between ARC/ORC and/or manual. It has two downsides though: small community, and the BDFL can sometimes be rough to interact with. ¹ https://0xc0ffee.netlify.app/osdev I, too, have been looking for a unicorn systems programming language, but it doesn't exit yet. Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

Many Rust programs try to achieve memory safety while using a non-memory-safe language (be it C or unsafe Rust), and there's an entire spectrum of combining language features that offer sound guarantees with careful analysis and testing of unsafe code to achieve a safe program.

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less.

Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

Again, the goal of writing a memory-safe program is understandable, but there's more than one way to achieve that goal when it comes to language guarantees. That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim). But even for educational purposes, using a language with a poor selection of libraries is likely to lead to a bad experience if what you want to produce is working, non-trivial software. Every project includes some \"boring\" aspects -- such as parsing configuration and data files -- that you won't necessarily enjoy writing from scratch.

One thing that's important to notice, I think, is that low-level languages' combined market share has fallen sharply since the 1970s, and it doesn't seem that the trend is about to sharply reverse direction. To me that suggests that if a low-level language wants to be more popular than C++, it should focus on low-level programming and shouldn't try to also be a good applications programming language (as C++ has tried to do that, but the overall market share of C and C++ is lower now than it was in, say, 1990), but I could be wrong about that. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum.

But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant.

But this is easier to see in my example because parity is a very functional, as opposed to technical property. > This is one of those quotes like \"Don't let perfect be the enemy of good\". I am not calling for perfect. Quite the opposite. I am saying that software correctness is extremely complicated, and even the biggest researchers in the field have been surprised by outcomes that were counterintuitive to them. Yet you seem to have decided that Rust gives the best results of everything that's available, while I have my doubts, especially because I see how people are turning away from Rust and how much it struggles to capture a significant portion of the low-level programming market even at its quite advanced age. I don't think there's a single language in the top ten that's had such low adoption at Rust's current age, and that's not the kind of thing you expect to see with a technology whose excited but small fanbase claim to hit an excellent pragmatic sweet spot. > We have empirical evidence that Rust has measurable impact on bugs, especially memory safety ones. Compared to C, yes. That's exactly what you expect if more sound guarantees help and then hurt -- a language with some sound guarantees to be better than a language with virtually none. But that is not to say that other languages with either more or less sound guarantees aren't an even better sweet spot. reply",

One thing I am wary of is using a truly massive language like C++ on a multi-programmer project without consensus on which features to use and how to use them.  Maybe you have in mind something like that? If you want the simplicity of C with more safety, maybe tooling like Frama-C, a MISRA C conformance checker, or just aggressive use of static and dynamic analysis tools like ASAN and UBSAN.  You can also disable certain optimizations (e.g., strict aliasing) to steer away from some of the major pitfalls of UB. reply",

As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

Which has probably changed gradually up to this point. Not to frame it more ominously or anything, but when you pull the trigger, that's the day you make a stepwise life change into being a business operator if you have never been one before.  Just a little life change, no big deal, that's what you have been working on the whole time, how long has it been?  A flying leap from the uphill trail you have been on, that you're going to jump further upward from sooner or later as the intended goal. Single-handedly it's not like lots of other ways too, even when technology is not involved. If it flies off the shelf as-is, you may never have enough time to complete it \"properly\".  Or worse, if there is not realistic interest, you'll need to spend more time promoting it than you were probably spending coding.  Either way can mean no more coding at all for the foreseeable future, which you have to be prepared for even if you have incredible advantages there and that's where all your progress has come from up until that point. I've done it and my technology has never been perfect, not even as good as it could be. I guess I distilled it down to a business concept I wanted to live by, the day I decided to change my life, abstracted from the tech. Not the same concept as other people, but I have to be able to live with it. I just want to give clients their money's worth. If the bugs and rough edges are not show-stoppers on those terms, the greatest obstacle has already been lifted for me. I can then launch based more on strategy than undue hesitation. reply",

But I was determined to ship, so once the code was deployable (the bear minimum, nginx with ssl setup) I pushed to my VPS and posted a link on HN. It was late Sunday night, was very tired, but just wanted to get real user feedback. But I also knew the chances of anyone seeing the link and actually giving feedback were slim, so I tried not to worry too much about it. The important bit was taking the first step and shipping something. Everything else follows from that. So, my advice is to put it out there and invite people that could give you helpful feedback. Avoid toxic communities as that will only add to the stress. Best of luck! reply",

          "text": "As a fellow engineer, I think I've been there myself. What helped me was realizing that I had the wrong mental model of what \"launching\" means. Think of product development like farming: we engineer a product (seed), plant it in the field, and then customer attention (water) nourishes it while our customer support (care) nurtures it over time. Eventually, we harvest the results. In this model, it makes sense that we obsess over the quality of our seeds since that largely determines yield when given sufficient water and care. When you work at a company, you build something, hit a quality bar, and there's a big launch day. But for indie founders, that model doesn't work well. Let me explain why with an expanded version of this farming analogy: Think of your product as a seed and your marketing as an irrigation system. Established companies already have deep irrigation channels dug. Water (customer attention) flows naturally to their fields. Thousands of eyeballs naturally see their products every day through existing marketing channels, social media presence, and brand recognition. The reason your experience at work makes you believe launching is so crucial is because your company has already built these irrigation channels. They've constructed a system that brings fresh eyeballs to look at proposed solutions each and every day. As an engineer there, you're just putting seeds into already-prepared soil. You get everything ready, then turn a valve to divert customer-attention water from another established field to your new ground. Then you watch your product work (or not) for all these customers and grow. But as a solo founder, you have no irrigation channels yet. There's no natural flow of attention to what you're building. You don't have a marketing channel established. It feels like you have a tiny cup of attention (your personal network), and that's understandably terrifying. If you spend your one cup of attention on your seed and it doesn't grow, you're screwed. You've used up your limited resource with nothing to show for it. Your fear likely comes from feeling like you have a small, non-renewable supply of attention. Once used up, that's it. Here's a thought experiment: Imagine I promised to bring two real potential customers to your house every day (let's say I'd pay you $10,000 for each day I failed, so you know I'm serious). Two real human beings, just like the people you validated the idea with. Brand new. Never seen them before, never see them again. How would you feel about your product then? If you knew you'd get fresh eyeballs on your product daily - a guaranteed stream of attention from the right people - the pressure of a \"perfect launch\" would vanish. You'd just explain your solution, get feedback, fix issues, and try again tomorrow with new people. I personally believe it's impossible for any engineer to fail if they get 100 days of direct feedback from people. Tell me specifically how getting feedback from a different person each day for 100 days won't work. Concretely, find where your potential customers already hang out online. Here's what most people here would advise: Finding people ALREADY looking for a solution: 1) Instead of cold DMs, I searched for posts like \"anyone know a tool that...\" or \"frustrated with [competitor]\" and offered genuine help. 2) Leading with help, not sales. My first message is usually answering their question thoroughly. 3) Only AFTER providing value did I mention \"I actually built a tool that might help...\" My email is in my profile if you want to talk about it further. reply",

In some cultures there is a specific amount of time where everyone understands the bereaved won't be doing much other than honoring the dead by paring away all distractions and just existing. That sounds difficult as a US-ian raised on distractions, but I gave it a try several years ago when my dog died. Ended up sharing a good cry with an older lonely neighbor who was also closely bonded with their aging dog, and later I was there for them after their dog passed on- thanks to embracing grief and vulnerability we were less alone in our suffering, but not wallowing either; it felt healthy. It took me many months before the waves of sadness and loss subsided, and a year or two to where the dominant memories are joy, love, adventure. All that to say- especially given your fortune, I wouldn't be concerned with what's next at the expense of what's now. reply",

Obviously there is another kind of travel that’s more focused on luxury/hedonism/etc. that’s not my thing, and in my humble opinion risks getting caught up in alcohol/drugs/empty sex/etc. would not recommend especially because the temptation of doing all of the above to excess would be there if you’re popping bottles in Miami Beach or whatever. One thing you might want to do would be to see who would like to have you as an advisor for their startup. You successfully did a hard thing that thousands are desperate to do. Many could benefit from your learned lessons. You could offer to give talks at your alma mater, help vet people’s startup ideas, etc. I know you may not feel like you’re some genius or oracle but you’d make a much better judge of that kind of thing than I would! reply",

I’m not sure what to do next — with my time, my energy, or even with my life. You may be tempted to fill your time and spend your energy and money on things that take your mind off of \"life\". Drugs, alcohol, gambling, carnal pleasures, clubbing, etc. It will spiral and you'll lose your life, health, and wealth. You are a prime target for leeches and parasites who smell a lonely soul with a full wallet a mile away. Were you to need an addiction to \"cope\" and \"avoid reality\", make it an addiction that could: 1 - fade a way 2 - not ruin your health, wealth, and time. 3 - become a net positive For instance: picking up a sport (judo, jiu-jitsu, wrestling), hiking, pursuing a degree, going to workshops that make you work with your hands (masonry, ceramics, carpentry, agriculture, stonewalls, manufacturing/fabrication). These may be coping mechanisms and just a \"transition\", but they are virtuous coping mechanisms and I don't see you regretting your masonry classes; on the contrary, you will have acquired a skill for life even if/after your interest \"fades away\", and may even become your business. In other words, please be very careful and deliberate about how you spend your health, time, and money. You'll also be tempted to brood and stay home or on the contrary, be out all night and chasing pleasures, hence my recommendations on physical activities (judo and masonry) for you really ought to stay connected with your body and physical being especially now. If you work out, don't stop. If you don't, start. reply",

I didn't know how to explain it to the family doctor to make him send me to one (live in Norway, where taxes are insane, but if you make your case right, you get almost free medical assistance, capped at $300/y). I also didn't know it was worth it even with costs that seemed prohibitive. It's worth knowing, that psychologists are like programmers - not everyone is good at everything. Find a couple specializing in supporting grieving people, see at least 3 and decide which one fits you best. Sending love, hope you get better! reply",

          "text": "The technical term for where you've arrived at is \"mid life crisis\" - albeit a bit earlier than most. Your search for success is over. So the next step becomes the search for significance. First though, as others have said, your \"what to do next\" is colored by the natural grieving process you need to go through. Accept that your emotions will likely be all over the place for a while. This isn't a time for big decisions, but rather smaller, quieter, times for you to find a new simple routine. Once your life has returned to (emotional) normal, then you can start the next chapter. Being significant means making a difference, on the people around you, on your environment, and so on. Like with most things, there's no \"quick path\". You need to try this, try that, and see what sticks. Local charities are always a good place to start (they can use the help) but they may just be a stepping stone till you find your place. Interacting with youth in some way (school, church, clubs etc) can also be very inspirational (for you and for them.) Kids like to hear stories of success (they're still on that path) and hearing it from someone young - closer to their own age - really sticks. Most of all, don't panic if you wake up tomorrow with nothing to do. You've got a long road ahead. You don't need to rush. Take some time to just settle down. Maybe go on a trip to somewhere peaceful. Good luck. reply",

Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

          "text": "I take issue with your idea that it is \"tier 2+\" that are the only programs that are worth it. When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

If the course is just software engineering, don't bother imho. If it's compsci, do it. Do the hard stuff. You'll have an edge the others don't.

          "text": "As someone who has interviewed candidates for a FANG company in the distant past I can't say that degrees matter, but I can say that people I interviewed with degrees generally did better. There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

I did some research towards this end and found some existing tools that could be useful: - https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/ (Barcode system for Grocy) - https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ (Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone.

I believe that we actually hold a lot of economic power through our consumption choices, especially those of us in first world economies or with higher income. Not only could this be more influential that casting a vote every four or five years, but it actually gives you the opportunity to express a much more nuanced view rather than picking one of two (or a handful of) politicians who represent a portfolio of policies that might not be that different from each other (thus offering no real choice) or where you have to pick the lesser of two evils (thus implicitly endorsing policies you disagree with). Currently this economic power is largely squandered (except for extreme cases like boycotts), like misaligned magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnet cancelling each other out in the absence of an external magnetic field. If instead we could get all the individuals to align, consumers in the economic force case or atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles in the magnetism case, then the same collection of individuals is able to produce a powerful force field with real effects. reply",

The computer in the store that drives the POS scanners then can print out the shelf label stickers and a poor sod goes and replaces the stickers on the shelves. This is all a big secret of course, so asking a grocery store for their prices is going to get you nowhere. You could try scraping the websites, but often the price for online shopping is different to what is in store. Best bet would be to offer an incentive for people to scan their receipts into your app.  I don't know what kind of incentive you could build to do that, maybe for every 5 receipts you could offer a coupon or something.  Not much of an idea and a massive PITA, it would also only give prices on those things that people bought. edit:  also gets complicated for multi-item discounts or combination discounts reply",

It wasn't legal to crowdsource it; stores had to share it willingly. I'm not sure of the Act is still there, but we ended up pivoting around it. You can skirt laws like Uber did and sometimes change them. But be aware of the how far you can skirt them. If you're making a political statement, be extra careful. In our case, shops were unhappy because of the business model. They overcharged on some things and made others look cheap, but to whomever they targeted, they wanted to look cheap. When we compared a grocery list between multiple shops, it turns out most had similar totals. It would have encouraged user behavior where they buy chicken in this shop, salmon there, diapers in another shop. And because all of these were loss leaders, it would have been bad for the stores overall. Also consider the protectionist environment that brings about tariffs and the current hostile climate against \"tech bros\", and it's a doubly bad idea - if the law doesn't get you, the mob will. But if they share it with you willingly, it's normally legal and less work. We had a phase when implementing GST where companies would advertise that they were not raising prices. All you have to do is verify this. You can even charge an advertising fee. reply",
