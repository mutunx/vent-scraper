          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\". I think for one of them we managed to get a few thousand or something from someone's employer to cover some costs. But \"sponsorship\" would be a strong word.

The actual technical side was never that impressive or interesting. One community that kicks ass at this are InfoSec people, I've done a lot of terrific volunteer-run CTFs. reply",

          "text": "Hack the hackathon. My follow-at-your-own-risk pro tip: Find a team not too much into wining and - connect with others. They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice.

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP).

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

          "text": "I haven't been to a hackathon in a long time, but the best ones I remember were explicitly about getting designers and developers to build something concrete but simple for a good cause. I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing.

At the end there was a big presentation that anyone in the company could attend and each team would present what they came up with. Some of them eventually became products directly, or at least set the groundwork for future products.

They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

The hackathons I remember as a college student were different. They were much more free form. You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box.

And I have had the same sentiment in the quantum computing space as well and thinking through the reason for it, my sense is that 24-48 hours is not enough time to build something meaningful. This is not to say that absolutely cannot be done, but the chances of something cool being made are generally low. My guess is that this idea might hold in general, anything that can be built really quickly tends not to be too impressive and all impressive things tend to take longer.\nI have gotten to a point where, if I see something impressive, I have this nagging feeling, Was this completed here? or were you working on this for a decent amount of time and just took this opportunity to showcase it? reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

To quote one girl: \"Bro, my backend is just stateless Ollama calls and prompt templates. I could one-shot this garbage while hammered.\" So, yes, they do feel fake. There's no challenge.

No idea what are the social cues that led them to this, but I would find that interesting to study. I don't think they're ill intentioned, I think they don't consider lying to be bad and it's some sort of way of going through life. Not long ago I was having dinner w/ some scammers (one of them is on the latest YC batch, btw) and this guy was telling everybody that you need to lie to get ahead, \"if you don't lie to your investors they will invest in someone else who is lying to them\".

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

There's an extensive amount of brush, leaves, etc of varying ages that could maybe be shredded up into something useful, invasive vines I'm still trying to deal with, and more old trash than I've fully figured out how to properly dispose of. It's turning into various DIY rabbit holes, actually, with the next one (outside of various related landscaping stuff) being to gut a basement. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

A lot of these trees done by tree care companies in residential or commercial areas are also sprawling hardwood trees like oaks that can't always be safely just dropped from the ground even if there's a clear area to drop it in.

On top of that, it uses a lightweight AI model to read product descriptions and filter based on things like ingredients (e.g., flagging peanut butter with BPA by checking every photograph of the plastic or avoiding palm oil by reading the nutrition facts) or brand lists (e.g., only showing WSAVA-compliant dog foods).

Anyway, Costco didn't always win, but in my experience, they frequently did -- $5 peanut butter @ Costco vs $7.74 @ Target based on whatever size and brand I got, which is interesting because Costco doesn't have \"generic\" PB, whereas Target has much cheaper Market Pantry, and I tried to opt for that. reply",

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience.

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end. Also, in my free time, I learn and share my knowledge by writing blogs, newsletters, Youtube videos, or speaking at conferences. reply",

I spent the early part of my career at early stage startups and have spent the past 8 years or so doing mostly greenfield projects on a contract basis. I've done a lot in the dev tools space, and with graphically intensive web applications (e.g. domain-specific CAD tools). I'm working on some LLM infrastructure tooling that I designed and have partly built that I plan to commercialize so I'm looking for something pretty part time. I think I could be very useful on the right project, but I also have a lot of constraints on what I'm looking for (part-time, could be AI-related but won't sign restrictive contracts in that space). For a person/team that can be flexible on this kind of stuff definitely reach out, happy to talk! I'll consult for reasonable rates too if you want advice/second opinion/ideas/approaches for building AI products. reply",

I’ve worked on problems like reinforcement learning for tumor landmark detection in MRI, and deep learning for physical systems and protein structure prediction. I like forming own ideas and following them through — from literature review to implementation, evaluation, and iteration. I can reproduce papers, fine-tune models, explore new methods, and design experiments that actually test hypotheses. I’m especially motivated by early-stage work that blends research thinking with practical engineering. In team settings, I tend to gravitate toward coordination and planning roles, and outside of work, I’ve led a 300+ member volleyball department for several years — which taught me how to manage people, not just models. I'm looking for roles at the intersection of research and engineering, eg early-stage AI projects where curiosity, ownership, technical depth matter and impact-driven development are valued. reply",

          "text": "About My core focus is solving real business problems QUICKLY and AFFORDABLY in a way that's easy to enhance and extend. Whether you need to streamline operations, replace outdated systems, or build something new, I deliver practical solutions quickly without cutting corners. About Me I've been building software systems professionally since the mid-90s, working across industries like finance, payments, scientific research, mil-spec, and telecoms. For most of the past 25 years, I focused on embedded systems, though I still take on the occasional eBPF or IoT project for select clients. These days, I prefer developing Line-of-Business (LoB) applications for SMEs; the faster turnaround and immediate impact make it especially rewarding. What I Deliver I specialize in building Line-of-Business web-applications tailored to SMEs, using a lean proprietary low-code technology stack. For most projects, I deliver functional, reliable apps in 4-6 weeks; a typical project costs around $5000 USD as a one-time fee. I also accommodate clients who prefer a monthly subscription model (yes, SaaS habits are hard to break). What makes me faster and more cost-effective? I've developed a proprietary framework that accelerates development while allowing rapid, low-code-style enhancements. Clients receive full source code with a non-redistribution license, ensuring they can extend or maintain their solution without being locked into ongoing contracts. If you need a Line-of-Business app done fast and affordably, without sacrificing quality, I'll quickly give you a very good idea of cost for your intended scope.

In addition to strong programming and architectural skills, I'm a force multiplier for any team through the three T's -- teaching, talking, and tooling. In the past, I've led teams of up to 12, managed interview pipelines, pioneered a number of no- and low-code solutions for all of the following -- stream processing, data model, query generation, form building, workflow systems, and front-end construction -- for a variety of industries, including those with strong regulatory requirements and complex business rules such as healthcare and fintech. More recently, I've built a no-code form-filler and a workflow engine for coordinating LLMs and other generative AI processes, and on top of this a platform for both minimizing hallucinations and working with documents that are far too large for existing context window outputs using a novel, patent-pending process. I am also an improvisational pianist and distinguished poet.

          "text": "Location: New York City Remote: Sure, but my preference is in-office. Willing to relocate: No Technologies: JAX, PyTorch, Machine learning in general, Python, Rust Resume: https://www.echonolan.net/resume/cv.pdf Email: echo@echonolan.net I'm an ML engineer/research engineer looking for work in that vein. I can train models, I can design architectures, I can implement papers, I can gather real and synthetic data, and I can in general solve the problems that come up when trying to build ML systems. Background: I recently ended a 3 month contract at Redwood Research doing AI safety research where I spent about half my time improving our synthetic data pipelines and about half finetuning LLMs to exhibit unsafe behavior in deployment but not training, and to do so while defeating probes trained to detect the unsafe behavior (but only in deployment). I also have an ongoing solo research project working on text-to-image models trained without any text, relying on embeddings for conditioning. [1] is a (very out of date) blog post about that. There'll be a paper soon inshallah. Before the ML stuff I worked at a startup where we built a new cryptocurrency, and before that another startup.

          "text": "Sarama | Canine Language Specialist | On-site (San Francisco, CA) | Full Time | Must have a dog | praful@sarama.ai Company: We’re building smart collars and devices to decode dog communication—using audio, motion, and behavior data. Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift!

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

Our primary technical bet is that if you capture annotated \"diffs\" of user information with the appropriate annotation, you can create path-dependence to train AI models in an AlphaGo like context. By doing so, we achieve agentic experiences for markets that have never even had an opportunity to imagine what life would be like with basic observability. Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal/regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities. We're in stealth, but recently venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market. We're hiring for a few roles at the senior/staff levels:\n1. HCI Engineer - You're a prosemirror wizard who probably follows Ink & Switch or the UCSB HCI lab on Twitter; front-end/rich-text/typescript focused; lots of architectural/sync engine work\n2. Systems/Compiler Engineer - We design and build dev tools for languages we create that compile into various graph representations. These range from financial modeling calcs (which need to go very fast to support a seamless UX), to computable representations of legal agreements. Extra points if you've worked with hypergraphs. This in Rust but we're exploring a few other languages. Email resume/linkedin/twitter to oliver@phosphor.co if you might fit somewhere in here, or if you've taken a credible attempt at building end-user programming tools. reply",

I wanted to check out at 4PM, not have to think about work after that, and do whatever I wanted. Since making this decision I've become an expert in a number of hobbies, gotten married, had kids, and am now living a quite pleasant life. The financial freedom people aim for in retirement, the time, I have that already. I'm already living a care-free life, largely doing what I want. I have a family member who is a multi-millionaire and who owns multiple businesses. He has more money now than I'll have in my lifetime. But I have something that he doesn't have - time. In my estimation time is a much more valuable commodity to obtain than money. If you can work your career so you have enough money, but also time, that's a more valuable goal than simply 'being rich'. Money with no free time and boat load of stress is a shit life. reply",

          "text": "As someone who eventually 'got rich' (to a very comfortable FatFIRE level) after decades of high-tech startup entrepreneurship across three startups and over a dozen new products, my primary objective was never \"get rich\". It was to earn a good living, making cool things, in ways I found interesting, in collaboration with people I liked, for customers I liked ( <--- that last part is important ). While I knew making better-than-good money was always a possibility, it was never the deciding factor in choosing what to do, how to do it, who to do it with or for. > trying to come up with multi-million dollar ideas In my experience, starting with that mindset is unlikely to work - and worse, its focusing on the wrong thing. If you can see the multi-million dollar idea - so can other people, including competitors with more money and momentum than a new startup. I approached it differently. The general pattern which had the best success rate for me was applying a new technology (or old tech in a new way) which I found intriguing or cool to solve a real-world problem in a new or different way that was both better and cheaper than existing solutions. One important element was validating very early on that this problem actually existed and was important (ie high-value) to real potential customers. This meant actually meeting these people and sharing a non-functioning demo or conceptual prototype able to get them interested enough to want to test prototypes as the product evolved. If your non-functioning solution demo doesn't get real potential customers almost pleading to get in the beta - then you don't yet have the right problem, solution or customer. Developing solutions to solve real problems for real people whose names, needs and preferences we already knew made development both easier AND a lot more fun. It kept us focused and grounded in ways that were transformative. Note: I didn't say there had to be a million customers with a validated TAM of zillions of dollars. Just a handful of real customers in enough need to want to spend their limited time guiding some startup's non-existent product into existence. They're not doing it because they're nice, they're doing it because they're not happy with what they've got and want to ensure your solution arrives in a form able to solve their problem. I never spent a lot of time validating there was a huge market beyond the first pool of customers. I felt okay as long as there was plausible evidence of some reasonably sizable number of customers beyond our handful of \"new best friend\" customers. Doing it this way ensured we'd make some number of early adopters delighted as well as there being a high probability of at least enough early customers for a two-pizza-sized company to survive for a while. While this was no guarantee of eventual riches, it did help ensure we were making something of real immediate value for at least some real customers who'd pay for our solution - and that alone put us past about >80% of the early issues that kill startups. The \"riches\" possibility is innate because once you're successfully applying an interesting new technology in new ways to solve a real problem that at least some real customers will pay real money for - there's probably at least a 10% - 20% chance you're one pivot (or less) away from an emerging new market you can be on (or close) to the ground floor of. So - once you're nearing first delivery to your \"new best friend\" customers, start keeping your eyes peeled for that emerging opportunity that's somewhere nearby in the same or an adjacent market. If it's not there, you've still got a lifestyle-sized business that's either breaking even or close to it, and that alone provides options. You can decide there's potential and work toward turning that break even into profit and growth or you can pivot to something adjacent with the benefit of some cash flow, real customers and the momentum of a shipping team. And that alone tends to get the attention of all the VCs who previously wouldn't return your calls. > I hate the business side... actually figuring out how to make money... That's the hard part. I doubt you'll be able to make it as a tech startup entrepreneur until you re-frame that. I used to jokingly say \"If you solve a present and painful problem for your customers, it's hard to get them to stop throwing money at you.\" While an exaggeration, there's serious truth there. As for making money, until you find engineering a business model that actually works just as fascinating as engineering any other machine into actually fucking working - you'll suck at doing it and keep hating it. If you don't see a 'business model' as just another interesting, tangible and tractable engineering problem to be instrumented, debugged and solved - you'll probably have a better time working for other people. > I like building stuff with my friends Okay, when you guys are done playing with yourselves, maybe try playing with someone else... or, even better, for someone else. Like real customers. Helping nice people in real need is way more interesting, challenging and emotionally rewarding than playing with yourselves. And having an audience who's invested in the quality of your performance is a wonderful way stay grounded in what matters. I got into this as a 20 year-old introvert who liked nerding around with computers, but on the journey I ended up meeting nice people with interesting problems and discovered I kind of liked using my nerd powers to 'save them' from the shitty, costly or annoying problem making part of their day miserable. Give it a try. Frankly, if solving interesting problems in cool ways for nice people doesn't light up some chunk of neurons in your skull, then maybe entrepreneurship isn't for you. Bottom line, the way I eventually managed to \"get rich\" was by not trying to get rich. Instead, I changed my definition of success to: having fun with my friends solving real problems in technically interesting ways for real customers we liked. I emotionally came to peace with the reality that, if all I managed to do was solve problems for enough people to pay our rent and bills with a few bucks left over - that alone was enough. Not only enough to be worth doing but enough to be morally and ethically \"Good\". Sure, more financial upside would be nice if it happened but, the reality is, some of that will always be out of our control. Your post sounds like you're basically giving up on playing the tech startup game. Before you do, at least consider there may be ways to redefine the game so that it matters to more people than you and your friends, so that money is not the only metric and so that \"winning\" is mostly within your control. reply",

Correct. I'm still open to working for startups, but as far as coming up with my own ideas, I've accepted it's probably not going to happen. I still plan on making some side projects, working on an open source game now, and I've written a script ( probably going to switch it to a short graphical novel I can self fund). I definitely will revisit your comment in the future, I think you've just provided a full semester of Business School in a few paragraphs. What I take from this is I need to find the tools that people want, and actually build those instead of building tools and then telling people how amazing and great they are. I think the next big B2B opportunity would be something like Pivotal Tracker / Jira , but with intelligent LLM generated summaries of what each team member is working on. As well as the option to assign small scale tickets to code agents which would either write the code or at a minimum create a branch with the methods stubbed out. I don't really think I have the capital to do this personally. But hypothetically if I did, I'd build a POC and then offer it to members of my game dev group. Or maybe I should just go down to this one bar where I know a lot of old school business folks hang out. These are men and women with relatively high net worths, and just ask straight up what problems they'd liked solved. Do you have any suggestions for books on your business philosophy ? I might have free time in a few months. reply",

          "text": "In IT there are three highly generalized routes to consider: * Low barrier of entry jobs, like most web developer jobs. Good luck, it’s a race to the bottom but it’s also where most of the jobs are. The goal here is to pad your resume with nonsense and compete with hundreds of other people that are also padding their resumes. * Jobs that require licenses and/or certifications. These will be jobs like cloud infrastructure support, cyber defense, routing/switching, project management, and operations. These jobs are harder to qualify for and are fewer than the prior bullet point but are a much safer bet and tend to pay more. * High talent jobs, which include the gaming industry and more engineering type jobs. These jobs are the fewest and not as secure as the prior category. They also are the most variable in compensation, but they tend to be the most fulfilling for people with high intelligence or high creativity. Know which way you want to go because the means to achieve these jobs differ radically. reply",

          "text": "Check out Nim. I'm using it to build an x86-64 kernel¹ (Fusion OS), and it satisfies a lot of the low-level system programming requirements with an elegant and expressive syntax. For memory management you can choose between ARC/ORC and/or manual. It has two downsides though: small community, and the BDFL can sometimes be rough to interact with. ¹ https://0xc0ffee.netlify.app/osdev I, too, have been looking for a unicorn systems programming language, but it doesn't exit yet. Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

Many Rust programs try to achieve memory safety while using a non-memory-safe language (be it C or unsafe Rust), and there's an entire spectrum of combining language features that offer sound guarantees with careful analysis and testing of unsafe code to achieve a safe program.

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less.

Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

Again, the goal of writing a memory-safe program is understandable, but there's more than one way to achieve that goal when it comes to language guarantees. That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim). But even for educational purposes, using a language with a poor selection of libraries is likely to lead to a bad experience if what you want to produce is working, non-trivial software. Every project includes some \"boring\" aspects -- such as parsing configuration and data files -- that you won't necessarily enjoy writing from scratch.

One thing that's important to notice, I think, is that low-level languages' combined market share has fallen sharply since the 1970s, and it doesn't seem that the trend is about to sharply reverse direction. To me that suggests that if a low-level language wants to be more popular than C++, it should focus on low-level programming and shouldn't try to also be a good applications programming language (as C++ has tried to do that, but the overall market share of C and C++ is lower now than it was in, say, 1990), but I could be wrong about that. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum.

But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant.

But this is easier to see in my example because parity is a very functional, as opposed to technical property. > This is one of those quotes like \"Don't let perfect be the enemy of good\". I am not calling for perfect. Quite the opposite. I am saying that software correctness is extremely complicated, and even the biggest researchers in the field have been surprised by outcomes that were counterintuitive to them. Yet you seem to have decided that Rust gives the best results of everything that's available, while I have my doubts, especially because I see how people are turning away from Rust and how much it struggles to capture a significant portion of the low-level programming market even at its quite advanced age. I don't think there's a single language in the top ten that's had such low adoption at Rust's current age, and that's not the kind of thing you expect to see with a technology whose excited but small fanbase claim to hit an excellent pragmatic sweet spot. > We have empirical evidence that Rust has measurable impact on bugs, especially memory safety ones. Compared to C, yes. That's exactly what you expect if more sound guarantees help and then hurt -- a language with some sound guarantees to be better than a language with virtually none. But that is not to say that other languages with either more or less sound guarantees aren't an even better sweet spot. reply",

One thing I am wary of is using a truly massive language like C++ on a multi-programmer project without consensus on which features to use and how to use them.  Maybe you have in mind something like that? If you want the simplicity of C with more safety, maybe tooling like Frama-C, a MISRA C conformance checker, or just aggressive use of static and dynamic analysis tools like ASAN and UBSAN.  You can also disable certain optimizations (e.g., strict aliasing) to steer away from some of the major pitfalls of UB. reply",

As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

Which has probably changed gradually up to this point. Not to frame it more ominously or anything, but when you pull the trigger, that's the day you make a stepwise life change into being a business operator if you have never been one before.  Just a little life change, no big deal, that's what you have been working on the whole time, how long has it been?  A flying leap from the uphill trail you have been on, that you're going to jump further upward from sooner or later as the intended goal. Single-handedly it's not like lots of other ways too, even when technology is not involved. If it flies off the shelf as-is, you may never have enough time to complete it \"properly\".  Or worse, if there is not realistic interest, you'll need to spend more time promoting it than you were probably spending coding.  Either way can mean no more coding at all for the foreseeable future, which you have to be prepared for even if you have incredible advantages there and that's where all your progress has come from up until that point. I've done it and my technology has never been perfect, not even as good as it could be. I guess I distilled it down to a business concept I wanted to live by, the day I decided to change my life, abstracted from the tech. Not the same concept as other people, but I have to be able to live with it. I just want to give clients their money's worth. If the bugs and rough edges are not show-stoppers on those terms, the greatest obstacle has already been lifted for me. I can then launch based more on strategy than undue hesitation. reply",

But I was determined to ship, so once the code was deployable (the bear minimum, nginx with ssl setup) I pushed to my VPS and posted a link on HN. It was late Sunday night, was very tired, but just wanted to get real user feedback. But I also knew the chances of anyone seeing the link and actually giving feedback were slim, so I tried not to worry too much about it. The important bit was taking the first step and shipping something. Everything else follows from that. So, my advice is to put it out there and invite people that could give you helpful feedback. Avoid toxic communities as that will only add to the stress. Best of luck! reply",

          "text": "As a fellow engineer, I think I've been there myself. What helped me was realizing that I had the wrong mental model of what \"launching\" means. Think of product development like farming: we engineer a product (seed), plant it in the field, and then customer attention (water) nourishes it while our customer support (care) nurtures it over time. Eventually, we harvest the results. In this model, it makes sense that we obsess over the quality of our seeds since that largely determines yield when given sufficient water and care. When you work at a company, you build something, hit a quality bar, and there's a big launch day. But for indie founders, that model doesn't work well. Let me explain why with an expanded version of this farming analogy: Think of your product as a seed and your marketing as an irrigation system. Established companies already have deep irrigation channels dug. Water (customer attention) flows naturally to their fields. Thousands of eyeballs naturally see their products every day through existing marketing channels, social media presence, and brand recognition. The reason your experience at work makes you believe launching is so crucial is because your company has already built these irrigation channels. They've constructed a system that brings fresh eyeballs to look at proposed solutions each and every day. As an engineer there, you're just putting seeds into already-prepared soil. You get everything ready, then turn a valve to divert customer-attention water from another established field to your new ground. Then you watch your product work (or not) for all these customers and grow. But as a solo founder, you have no irrigation channels yet. There's no natural flow of attention to what you're building. You don't have a marketing channel established. It feels like you have a tiny cup of attention (your personal network), and that's understandably terrifying. If you spend your one cup of attention on your seed and it doesn't grow, you're screwed. You've used up your limited resource with nothing to show for it. Your fear likely comes from feeling like you have a small, non-renewable supply of attention. Once used up, that's it. Here's a thought experiment: Imagine I promised to bring two real potential customers to your house every day (let's say I'd pay you $10,000 for each day I failed, so you know I'm serious). Two real human beings, just like the people you validated the idea with. Brand new. Never seen them before, never see them again. How would you feel about your product then? If you knew you'd get fresh eyeballs on your product daily - a guaranteed stream of attention from the right people - the pressure of a \"perfect launch\" would vanish. You'd just explain your solution, get feedback, fix issues, and try again tomorrow with new people. I personally believe it's impossible for any engineer to fail if they get 100 days of direct feedback from people. Tell me specifically how getting feedback from a different person each day for 100 days won't work. Concretely, find where your potential customers already hang out online. Here's what most people here would advise: Finding people ALREADY looking for a solution: 1) Instead of cold DMs, I searched for posts like \"anyone know a tool that...\" or \"frustrated with [competitor]\" and offered genuine help. 2) Leading with help, not sales. My first message is usually answering their question thoroughly. 3) Only AFTER providing value did I mention \"I actually built a tool that might help...\" My email is in my profile if you want to talk about it further. reply",

In some cultures there is a specific amount of time where everyone understands the bereaved won't be doing much other than honoring the dead by paring away all distractions and just existing. That sounds difficult as a US-ian raised on distractions, but I gave it a try several years ago when my dog died. Ended up sharing a good cry with an older lonely neighbor who was also closely bonded with their aging dog, and later I was there for them after their dog passed on- thanks to embracing grief and vulnerability we were less alone in our suffering, but not wallowing either; it felt healthy. It took me many months before the waves of sadness and loss subsided, and a year or two to where the dominant memories are joy, love, adventure. All that to say- especially given your fortune, I wouldn't be concerned with what's next at the expense of what's now. reply",

Obviously there is another kind of travel that’s more focused on luxury/hedonism/etc. that’s not my thing, and in my humble opinion risks getting caught up in alcohol/drugs/empty sex/etc. would not recommend especially because the temptation of doing all of the above to excess would be there if you’re popping bottles in Miami Beach or whatever. One thing you might want to do would be to see who would like to have you as an advisor for their startup. You successfully did a hard thing that thousands are desperate to do. Many could benefit from your learned lessons. You could offer to give talks at your alma mater, help vet people’s startup ideas, etc. I know you may not feel like you’re some genius or oracle but you’d make a much better judge of that kind of thing than I would! reply",

I’m not sure what to do next — with my time, my energy, or even with my life. You may be tempted to fill your time and spend your energy and money on things that take your mind off of \"life\". Drugs, alcohol, gambling, carnal pleasures, clubbing, etc. It will spiral and you'll lose your life, health, and wealth. You are a prime target for leeches and parasites who smell a lonely soul with a full wallet a mile away. Were you to need an addiction to \"cope\" and \"avoid reality\", make it an addiction that could: 1 - fade a way 2 - not ruin your health, wealth, and time. 3 - become a net positive For instance: picking up a sport (judo, jiu-jitsu, wrestling), hiking, pursuing a degree, going to workshops that make you work with your hands (masonry, ceramics, carpentry, agriculture, stonewalls, manufacturing/fabrication). These may be coping mechanisms and just a \"transition\", but they are virtuous coping mechanisms and I don't see you regretting your masonry classes; on the contrary, you will have acquired a skill for life even if/after your interest \"fades away\", and may even become your business. In other words, please be very careful and deliberate about how you spend your health, time, and money. You'll also be tempted to brood and stay home or on the contrary, be out all night and chasing pleasures, hence my recommendations on physical activities (judo and masonry) for you really ought to stay connected with your body and physical being especially now. If you work out, don't stop. If you don't, start. reply",

I didn't know how to explain it to the family doctor to make him send me to one (live in Norway, where taxes are insane, but if you make your case right, you get almost free medical assistance, capped at $300/y). I also didn't know it was worth it even with costs that seemed prohibitive. It's worth knowing, that psychologists are like programmers - not everyone is good at everything. Find a couple specializing in supporting grieving people, see at least 3 and decide which one fits you best. Sending love, hope you get better! reply",

          "text": "The technical term for where you've arrived at is \"mid life crisis\" - albeit a bit earlier than most. Your search for success is over. So the next step becomes the search for significance. First though, as others have said, your \"what to do next\" is colored by the natural grieving process you need to go through. Accept that your emotions will likely be all over the place for a while. This isn't a time for big decisions, but rather smaller, quieter, times for you to find a new simple routine. Once your life has returned to (emotional) normal, then you can start the next chapter. Being significant means making a difference, on the people around you, on your environment, and so on. Like with most things, there's no \"quick path\". You need to try this, try that, and see what sticks. Local charities are always a good place to start (they can use the help) but they may just be a stepping stone till you find your place. Interacting with youth in some way (school, church, clubs etc) can also be very inspirational (for you and for them.) Kids like to hear stories of success (they're still on that path) and hearing it from someone young - closer to their own age - really sticks. Most of all, don't panic if you wake up tomorrow with nothing to do. You've got a long road ahead. You don't need to rush. Take some time to just settle down. Maybe go on a trip to somewhere peaceful. Good luck. reply",

Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

          "text": "I take issue with your idea that it is \"tier 2+\" that are the only programs that are worth it. When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

If the course is just software engineering, don't bother imho. If it's compsci, do it. Do the hard stuff. You'll have an edge the others don't.

          "text": "As someone who has interviewed candidates for a FANG company in the distant past I can't say that degrees matter, but I can say that people I interviewed with degrees generally did better. There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

I did some research towards this end and found some existing tools that could be useful: - https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/ (Barcode system for Grocy) - https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ (Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone.

I believe that we actually hold a lot of economic power through our consumption choices, especially those of us in first world economies or with higher income. Not only could this be more influential that casting a vote every four or five years, but it actually gives you the opportunity to express a much more nuanced view rather than picking one of two (or a handful of) politicians who represent a portfolio of policies that might not be that different from each other (thus offering no real choice) or where you have to pick the lesser of two evils (thus implicitly endorsing policies you disagree with). Currently this economic power is largely squandered (except for extreme cases like boycotts), like misaligned magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnet cancelling each other out in the absence of an external magnetic field. If instead we could get all the individuals to align, consumers in the economic force case or atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles in the magnetism case, then the same collection of individuals is able to produce a powerful force field with real effects. reply",

The computer in the store that drives the POS scanners then can print out the shelf label stickers and a poor sod goes and replaces the stickers on the shelves. This is all a big secret of course, so asking a grocery store for their prices is going to get you nowhere. You could try scraping the websites, but often the price for online shopping is different to what is in store. Best bet would be to offer an incentive for people to scan their receipts into your app.  I don't know what kind of incentive you could build to do that, maybe for every 5 receipts you could offer a coupon or something.  Not much of an idea and a massive PITA, it would also only give prices on those things that people bought. edit:  also gets complicated for multi-item discounts or combination discounts reply",

It wasn't legal to crowdsource it; stores had to share it willingly. I'm not sure of the Act is still there, but we ended up pivoting around it. You can skirt laws like Uber did and sometimes change them. But be aware of the how far you can skirt them. If you're making a political statement, be extra careful. In our case, shops were unhappy because of the business model. They overcharged on some things and made others look cheap, but to whomever they targeted, they wanted to look cheap. When we compared a grocery list between multiple shops, it turns out most had similar totals. It would have encouraged user behavior where they buy chicken in this shop, salmon there, diapers in another shop. And because all of these were loss leaders, it would have been bad for the stores overall. Also consider the protectionist environment that brings about tariffs and the current hostile climate against \"tech bros\", and it's a doubly bad idea - if the law doesn't get you, the mob will. But if they share it with you willingly, it's normally legal and less work. We had a phase when implementing GST where companies would advertise that they were not raising prices. All you have to do is verify this. You can even charge an advertising fee. reply",

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it.

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

          "text": "I think there's a natural process similar to gentrification in which as technology matures the hackathons promoting it transition into marketing-led events. I got into hackathons in the early 2010s when IoT was the hot new thing and saw the crowds change from hardcore technologists to mostly students and idea people. The fact is the same thing that what drew me in is what attracted them - opportunity and optimism. Sponsors expect ROI and once a technology is no longer experimental, the same tired projects tend to win because they are tried and true. I've been to a couple of good hackathons lately but they are more focused on vibe coding and tend to only run for 8-12 hours. These let you try out an idea or framework with little commitment but lack the depth of multi-day events. I've been attending an XR hackathon for almost a decade which still embodies the ethos, but it is a labor of love carried out by volunteers. These longer, challenging and intentional events can teach you more about teamwork and product in one weekend than a year of churning through tickets. reply",

          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\".

They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

As an old, I got to work with some non-jaded wide-eyed interns from U of Waterloo who worked their asses off on inspired hackathon projects as well as doing some solid work for our team. Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

Looking at the winners, it seemed like a team had been working on the project for months, and the hackathon was the company’s way of marketing it internally before launch. There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP). As far as we could tell, some video production team was tapped to hack together a video in 30 minutes, they threw our name on it, and shipped it. I don’t trust much after that. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice. I think it has always been like this. But if you really want to build something and there's a sponsor at the event you should ask them for lots of free credits or for some contact info in order to establish a longer-term sponsorship. reply",

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

          "text": "The hackathons I attended were focused on solving/addressing the Washington, DC budget (I know, very weirdly specific, but I'm a major policy wonk) and social services. To the latter, the benefit for me was to have tech folks help the policy folks ask and answer the right questions. Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing. Have to say, both events (and I attended several of each) were exciting. . . they challenged me in a way I was unfortunately not used to (except in high school and college) and showed that others were actually interested and part of the solution. The major plus of the budget hackathons was that we got to see students (middle schoolers, IIRC) who were doing whatever it was they were doing and having a blast. As a child advocate (lobbyist on kids issues), this made me very, very happy. reply",

Hype up an exciting atmosphere, assemble some folks with so few attachments in life that they have time to spend all weekend at a hackathon, and this ritual will summon up the old gods.

That behavior ruined the original ideas and incentives behind hackathons: networking and building cool stuff.

They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

My guess is that this idea might hold in general, anything that can be built really quickly tends not to be too impressive and all impressive things tend to take longer.\nI have gotten to a point where, if I see something impressive, I have this nagging feeling, Was this completed here? or were you working on this for a decent amount of time and just took this opportunity to showcase it? reply",

You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box.

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

No idea what are the social cues that led them to this, but I would find that interesting to study. I don't think they're ill intentioned, I think they don't consider lying to be bad and it's some sort of way of going through life. Not long ago I was having dinner w/ some scammers (one of them is on the latest YC batch, btw) and this guy was telling everybody that you need to lie to get ahead, \"if you don't lie to your investors they will invest in someone else who is lying to them\".

Although my formal leadership roles span the past eight years, I've been influencing teams and improving products far longer—because true product evolution demands more than passive participation; it requires initiative, ownership, and vision. My background in development, DevOps, testing, and quality has allowed me to deliver strategic and tactical improvements while keeping my hands on the work. I manage Linux servers and adjust code when needed, staying closely connected to current technologies and practices.

Email: kennynguyenx[at]gmail.com I’m Kenny, a full-stack software engineer looking for junior opportunities.

I have a graduate-level education in information science from an R1 university alongside degrees and research experience in the health sciences. To be very transparent, I’ve been unemployed for a while after operations for my previous company moved overseas and it's been tough trying to get back into the industry. I took time off to refine my computer science knowledge and get more confident in my engineering skills. I am really looking to break back into tech in a less design-focused role.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I spent the early part of my career at early stage startups and have spent the past 8 years or so doing mostly greenfield projects on a contract basis. I've done a lot in the dev tools space, and with graphically intensive web applications (e.g. domain-specific CAD tools). I'm working on some LLM infrastructure tooling that I designed and have partly built that I plan to commercialize so I'm looking for something pretty part time. I think I could be very useful on the right project, but I also have a lot of constraints on what I'm looking for (part-time, could be AI-related but won't sign restrictive contracts in that space). For a person/team that can be flexible on this kind of stuff definitely reach out, happy to talk!

I build with a strong sense of ownership, product and business value, not just code. I seek out collaboration with non-engineering teams to understand the broader context, and I’m not fazed by legacy systems. I'll make them work, make them fast, and make them stable without defaulting to rewrites. Over the years, I’ve worked at companies of various sizes and stages, learning what scales and when to apply the right tools and patterns. I'm someone who can move an MVP from early traction to real scale, untangle and upgrade your legacy codebase, or help a team grow through better processes and technical guidance, without needing detailed instructions to get started. Looking for a senior/staff role. Especially interested in roles related to computer vision and SLAM, but always happy at a keyboard. reply",

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

I'm obviously open to any suggestions for edits: Our app is used to authenticate users—specifically musicians—via the Instagram OAuth flow. We request access only to the instagram_business_basic permission and retrieve minimal public profile data, specifically the Instagram username. This information is used solely to associate an Instagram account with the corresponding user profile in our platform's database for identity verification purposes. Our role as a Tech Provider is limited to enabling musicians to link their verified Instagram accounts as a form of professional identity on our platform. This helps to ensure authenticity and trust among users, particularly industry professionals engaging with our artist-focused services. We do not collect, store, or process any private Instagram data. We do not publish content, provide analytics, or perform automated actions on behalf of users. The data retrieved is strictly limited to the public username field and is never shared with third parties. The user journey is as follows: 1. The user visits [REDACTED] and clicks the Connect Instagram button. 2. They are redirected to the official Instagram OAuth dialog to authorize access to their public profile. 3. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected back to our app, which then makes a request to the Instagram Graph API endpoint https://graph.instagram.com/me using the access token. 4. We extract the username field from the response and associate it with the user’s profile in our database to complete the verification process. Users have full control over their accounts and data. If a user wishes to remove their account and associated data from our platform, they can follow the instructions provided here: [REDACTED]. This implementation strictly follows Instagram's platform guidelines and privacy principles by minimizing data usage, requiring explicit user authorization, and ensuring transparency and user control. 1. How our business uses Platform Data to enable a product or service for our clients: [REDACTED] uses Instagram Data to show that content on our platform has been provided by an official source. More detailed info: Our platform, [REDACTED], provides a service that allows musicians to authenticate their identity by linking their Instagram accounts. This process utilises the Instagram OAuth flow to obtain the instagram_business_basic permission, specifically retrieving the public Instagram username. The data retrieved is used exclusively to associate an Instagram account with a user's profile on our platform, facilitating identity verification for musicians. This process ensures that the musicians' profiles are authentic and trusted by users engaging with our services. Our role as a Tech Provider is to enable musicians to link their verified Instagram accounts as a form of professional identity on our platform. This helps to ensure authenticity and trust among users. 2. How our clients use our product or service: Our clients are musicians with published music releases that the [REDACTED] service ties to additional content uploaded via our platform, including sleeve art image files, appropriate links and other contextual content. Our clients then share their profile and content with their fan base communities on social media, for users to experience an enhanced music release experience. More detailed info: Our clients are musicians who utilise our platform to manage their professional presence. By linking their verified Instagram accounts, they can: Enhance their profile's credibility and visibility to industry professionals. Provide a verified link to their public Instagram profile, showcasing their work and engagement with their audience.

Move to the top? Note that IG is used by many musicians and so why IG specifically, ie, really develop the last part of the last sentence? That Additional Information is also really key, yet is at the bottom. I'd suggest making it really clear at the top: key info, key reassurances, then get into details.

We'd get random rejections relating to functionality and check access logs to discover they hadn't even opened the app. What ended up working for us was just keeping consistent & simple responses to the usage questions, and whenever we received a rejection with a valid concern, we'd address it at the top of our existing response with something like \"In response to the latest rejection: ...\". Unfortunately it seems unless you get a competent reviewer, you're out of luck, so just keep submitting as soon as rejection comes in and eventually you'll get through. reply",

          "text": "Attendi | Senior Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer | Amsterdam, ON-SITE hybrid | Full-time (80-100%) Healthcare professionals have to spend too much time on administrative tasks when they should be spending that time delivering great care. Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society. Attendi has built a strong user base with its API-first speech-to-text solutions and client SDKs, loved by healthcare professionals via integrations with electronic health record (EHR) vendors. Currently, users interact with our products only within their EHR systems — but why stop there? We want to enable them to benefit from our tools anytime, anywhere. As a Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer, you’ll play a key role in developing our new (greenfield) products to support this ambition: Attendi’s first external full-stack app — which we see as the healthcare sector’s notepad. Our aim is to make it the default write-layer for medical data. But it’s far more than a simple notepad: speech-to-text and machine learning will be deeply integrated. We have a dedicated team with fewer than 25 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We're post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market. Check out https://attendi.recruitee.com/o/senior-frontend-focused-full... for more details on the position. Feel free to send any questions to berend [at] attendi [dot] nl. reply",

Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift!

          "text": "Ascertain | NYC (Hybrid ~3d/week) | Full-time | $180k–$280k + equity | Healthcare AI | Senior Engineers: Backend, Frontend, AI Ascertain is a healthcare AI startup backed by Northwell (New York's largest health system) and Deerfield. We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems. I'm a Principal Engineer here — if anything here resonates, drop me a line at john@ascertain.com or apply at our job board using https://lnkd.in/e5ZnGuqH ! reply",

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

When I left 13 years ago I was younger, more excited at the prospect of career and UK felt like a step ahead. Now I grew up, grew to hate cities, corporate life and found Italy a healthier and happier country for the next chapter.

Wikipedia summarizes it nicely: \"Sophistry\" is today used as a pejorative for a superficially sound but intellectually dishonest argument in support of a foregone conclusion. Loosely related: The 60's scifi novel \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" explored the idea of computers with powerful enough AI that they could construct a logically persuasive argument for any stance by cherry picking and manipulating the facts. In the book I think they called those computers Sophists, which seems particularly relevant today. You can absolutely ask an LLM to construct an argument to support any stance and, just like in the book, they can be used to produce misinformation and propaganda on a scale that makes it difficult for humans to discern the truth. reply",

Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

C# was kinda-sorta for this; as long as you're targeting an environment where GC is acceptable. (IE, as long as you're running in user-mode, as opposed to writing a kernel or a driver.) It does allow for C-style pointers, which might be useful if you need to call a lower-level system API. (Unfortunately, you can't just suck in a header file.) One thing you might miss is how errors, in Rust, are 0-cost. C# encourages exceptions over error codes, and throwing an exception has a much higher overhead than panic, because it captures a stack trace and allocates an object. (I must admit that I like Rust's error handling over C# because it differentiates cleanly \"anticipated\" errors versus exceptional situations.) reply",

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. The next times you find this feeling arising, please feel free to reach out, if you'd like; I would genuinely love to hear about it.

Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim).

One thing that's important to notice, I think, is that low-level languages' combined market share has fallen sharply since the 1970s, and it doesn't seem that the trend is about to sharply reverse direction. To me that suggests that if a low-level language wants to be more popular than C++, it should focus on low-level programming and shouldn't try to also be a good applications programming language (as C++ has tried to do that, but the overall market share of C and C++ is lower now than it was in, say, 1990), but I could be wrong about that. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum. The need for the spectrum arises because we want to sacrifice 100% memory-safety for other things, such as Java's ability to call C code. > The spectrum exist because rather than writing OS in Ada, programmers collectively decided to bury their heads into C. As someone who wrote safety-critical avionics software in Ada in the nineties, I can tell you that we had good reasons to largely abandon Ada. > an example of Nirvana fallacy. But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I am not talking about Rust in particular. I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant. In Rust terms, the compiler takes care of memory safety, but you need to put an effort into expressing memory-safe programs in Rust to fit within Rust's constraints, which are, necessarily more restrictive than memory safety (because they must use an inductive invariant). > And I'm saying it as a programmer field we should monotonically approach the ideal by removing languages that don't support it.

No one is suggesting that, it's just that what you're referring to as seatbelts could sometimes do more harm than good even for safety. We have empirical evidence that real seatbelts increase safety; things are nowhere near as clear for language soundness. Sure, C is so exceptionally weak that we can do better than that, and there's no doubt Rust is better on correctness than C, but that's not the same as saying Rust is better on correctness than any language that makes fewer guarantees than Rust. Why? Because, again, we've seen that the benefits of soundness are not linear -- they help until they start hurting. Knowing where that point is is not easy. reply",

I am not calling for perfect. Quite the opposite. I am saying that software correctness is extremely complicated, and even the biggest researchers in the field have been surprised by outcomes that were counterintuitive to them.

          "text": "UB issues in C is way overblown. Just don't do dumb shit with null pointers and use const where appropriate that eliminates most of it. As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

Since making this decision I've become an expert in a number of hobbies, gotten married, had kids, and am now living a quite pleasant life. The financial freedom people aim for in retirement, the time, I have that already. I'm already living a care-free life, largely doing what I want. I have a family member who is a multi-millionaire and who owns multiple businesses. He has more money now than I'll have in my lifetime. But I have something that he doesn't have - time. In my estimation time is a much more valuable commodity to obtain than money. If you can work your career so you have enough money, but also time, that's a more valuable goal than simply 'being rich'. Money with no free time and boat load of stress is a shit life. reply",

As many have pointed out, he can sell his business and retire, which you don’t have the option to do. Your rejoinder that he can’t do that because then he’d have too much time makes little sense, both because you’ve already setup the axiom that “more time = more freedom”, but also because he could at that point decide to do all kinds of things: start another business, buy one, get a job, work for charity, whatever. He’s quite obviously more free than you, although perhaps not psychologically, who can say. You don’t need to defend your life choices to anyone, but from the outside it looks like you’re making an illogical case because you can’t accept that he actually does have more freedom than you.

My short term needs are met in abundance and my long term needs are being addressed by putting money in investments every pay period. I make good money by any objective measure - but it’s equivalent to slightly less than  what a mid level developer makes in BigTech. I figured out how to make money - go to work for 40 hours a week, get good in my niche and companies with money put some of that money in my account in exchange for labor. reply",

          "text": "As someone who eventually 'got rich' (to a very comfortable FatFIRE level) after decades of high-tech startup entrepreneurship across three startups and over a dozen new products, my primary objective was never \"get rich\". It was to earn a good living, making cool things, in ways I found interesting, in collaboration with people I liked, for customers I liked ( <--- that last part is important ). While I knew making better-than-good money was always a possibility, it was never the deciding factor in choosing what to do, how to do it, who to do it with or for. > trying to come up with multi-million dollar ideas In my experience, starting with that mindset is unlikely to work - and worse, its focusing on the wrong thing. If you can see the multi-million dollar idea - so can other people, including competitors with more money and momentum than a new startup. I approached it differently. The general pattern which had the best success rate for me was applying a new technology (or old tech in a new way) which I found intriguing or cool to solve a real-world problem in a new or different way that was both better and cheaper than existing solutions. One important element was validating very early on that this problem actually existed and was important (ie high-value) to real potential customers. This meant actually meeting these people and sharing a non-functioning demo or conceptual prototype able to get them interested enough to want to test prototypes as the product evolved. If your non-functioning solution demo doesn't get real potential customers almost pleading to get in the beta - then you don't yet have the right problem, solution or customer. Developing solutions to solve real problems for real people whose names, needs and preferences we already knew made development both easier AND a lot more fun. It kept us focused and grounded in ways that were transformative. Note: I didn't say there had to be a million customers with a validated TAM of zillions of dollars. Just a handful of real customers in enough need to want to spend their limited time guiding some startup's non-existent product into existence. They're not doing it because they're nice, they're doing it because they're not happy with what they've got and want to ensure your solution arrives in a form able to solve their problem. I never spent a lot of time validating there was a huge market beyond the first pool of customers. I felt okay as long as there was plausible evidence of some reasonably sizable number of customers beyond our handful of \"new best friend\" customers. Doing it this way ensured we'd make some number of early adopters delighted as well as there being a high probability of at least enough early customers for a two-pizza-sized company to survive for a while. While this was no guarantee of eventual riches, it did help ensure we were making something of real immediate value for at least some real customers who'd pay for our solution - and that alone put us past about >80% of the early issues that kill startups. The \"riches\" possibility is innate because once you're successfully applying an interesting new technology in new ways to solve a real problem that at least some real customers will pay real money for - there's probably at least a 10% - 20% chance you're one pivot (or less) away from an emerging new market you can be on (or close) to the ground floor of. So - once you're nearing first delivery to your \"new best friend\" customers, start keeping your eyes peeled for that emerging opportunity that's somewhere nearby in the same or an adjacent market. If it's not there, you've still got a lifestyle-sized business that's either breaking even or close to it, and that alone provides options. You can decide there's potential and work toward turning that break even into profit and growth or you can pivot to something adjacent with the benefit of some cash flow, real customers and the momentum of a shipping team. And that alone tends to get the attention of all the VCs who previously wouldn't return your calls. > I hate the business side... actually figuring out how to make money... That's the hard part. I doubt you'll be able to make it as a tech startup entrepreneur until you re-frame that. I used to jokingly say \"If you solve a present and painful problem for your customers, it's hard to get them to stop throwing money at you.\" While an exaggeration, there's serious truth there. As for making money, until you find engineering a business model that actually works just as fascinating as engineering any other machine into actually fucking working - you'll suck at doing it and keep hating it. If you don't see a 'business model' as just another interesting, tangible and tractable engineering problem to be instrumented, debugged and solved - you'll probably have a better time working for other people. > I like building stuff with my friends Okay, when you guys are done playing with yourselves, maybe try playing with someone else... or, even better, for someone else. Like real customers. Helping nice people in real need is way more interesting, challenging and emotionally rewarding than playing with yourselves. And having an audience who's invested in the quality of your performance is a wonderful way stay grounded in what matters. I got into this as a 20 year-old introvert who liked nerding around with computers, but on the journey I ended up meeting nice people with interesting problems and discovered I kind of liked using my nerd powers to 'save them' from the shitty, costly or annoying problem making part of their day miserable. Give it a try. Frankly, if solving interesting problems in cool ways for nice people doesn't light up some chunk of neurons in your skull, then maybe entrepreneurship isn't for you. Bottom line, the way I eventually managed to \"get rich\" was by not trying to get rich. Instead, I changed my definition of success to: having fun with my friends solving real problems in technically interesting ways for real customers we liked. I emotionally came to peace with the reality that, if all I managed to do was solve problems for enough people to pay our rent and bills with a few bucks left over - that alone was enough. Not only enough to be worth doing but enough to be morally and ethically \"Good\". Sure, more financial upside would be nice if it happened but, the reality is, some of that will always be out of our control. Your post sounds like you're basically giving up on playing the tech startup game. Before you do, at least consider there may be ways to redefine the game so that it matters to more people than you and your friends, so that money is not the only metric and so that \"winning\" is mostly within your control. reply",

Correct. I'm still open to working for startups, but as far as coming up with my own ideas, I've accepted it's probably not going to happen. I still plan on making some side projects, working on an open source game now, and I've written a script ( probably going to switch it to a short graphical novel I can self fund). I definitely will revisit your comment in the future, I think you've just provided a full semester of Business School in a few paragraphs. What I take from this is I need to find the tools that people want, and actually build those instead of building tools and then telling people how amazing and great they are. I think the next big B2B opportunity would be something like Pivotal Tracker / Jira , but with intelligent LLM generated summaries of what each team member is working on. As well as the option to assign small scale tickets to code agents which would either write the code or at a minimum create a branch with the methods stubbed out. I don't really think I have the capital to do this personally. But hypothetically if I did, I'd build a POC and then offer it to members of my game dev group. Or maybe I should just go down to this one bar where I know a lot of old school business folks hang out. These are men and women with relatively high net worths, and just ask straight up what problems they'd liked solved. Do you have any suggestions for books on your business philosophy ? I might have free time in a few months. reply",

I read it as them being frustrated with the over-use of \"AI-powered X\" -- when everything is AI powered, is anything AI powered? Favorite quote from Garry Tan:  If everything is bold, nothing is bold! \"AI-powered\" as a descriptor is incredibly overused to the point where it no longer elicits the same excitement that it used to 1-2 years ago. I think everyone agrees that AI incorporated into a product can definitely make the product more useful. But let's stop describing our products as \"AI-powered\" and replace it with a descriptor that actually communicates the value the product is providing. Marketing for AI products would be more successful IMO if they stop using the words \"AI-powered\" and \"LLM\" and \"agents\" and \"tokens\", etc... users are overwhelmed with AI overload. Throw away the buzz words and use messaging that communicates the specific value that the AI adds. I think the days of consumers seeking out \"AI\" for the sake of AI is coming to an end. Consumers want to know what the AI will do for them. They don't care that it's AI-powered. reply",

If you’re building a product and it’s not working, pivoting in the direction of AI could definitely be rational—not because of the hype, or at least not only because of that (it doesn’t hurt). But because it could give you a better chance of building a more useful and differentiated product. Implying that any entrepreneur who does this is just following the herd is pretty uncharitable imo. Again, it would be like saying that about people pivoting to web in the early 2000s or mobile in the 2010s. Not every trend is fake. reply",

          "text": "In IT there are three highly generalized routes to consider: * Low barrier of entry jobs, like most web developer jobs. Good luck, it’s a race to the bottom but it’s also where most of the jobs are. The goal here is to pad your resume with nonsense and compete with hundreds of other people that are also padding their resumes. * Jobs that require licenses and/or certifications. These will be jobs like cloud infrastructure support, cyber defense, routing/switching, project management, and operations. These jobs are harder to qualify for and are fewer than the prior bullet point but are a much safer bet and tend to pay more. * High talent jobs, which include the gaming industry and more engineering type jobs. These jobs are the fewest and not as secure as the prior category. They also are the most variable in compensation, but they tend to be the most fulfilling for people with high intelligence or high creativity. Know which way you want to go because the means to achieve these jobs differ radically. reply",

The biggest risk that clients face is not the cost of the project per-se, but missed delivery and/or poor results.  So, in a sense, what you're really selling is not technical acumen, but trust and reliability. Yes, project failure can often be laid at the feet of the client. But, IMO, good professionals contract developers are responsible for pushing back on vague and/or changing requirements.  Part of your job is to look underneath what the client says to discern what he actually needs.  The goal should be to and deliver something that is both useful and fulfills the client's goals.

          "text": "Hi codingclaws, I own my eponymous firm, Andrew McWatters & Co. ( https://www.andrewmcwatters.com ) in Phoenix, Arizona. We have bench engineer staff and I am the only one who does sales. I write the contracts, as well as do the design work and engineering alongside my coworkers. I consider us a software development firm, but there are other companies that call themselves \"agencies\" in the valley. They do a bit more full-service work, while we focus on custom software specifically. The answer is that I work alongside a network of developers who have an established history of contacts here in Arizona, and I've also been in the industry for a number of years and previously worked at a large number of companies doing a mix of professional services work, contract, and full-time employment. That's the long way of saying that I obtain business by word-of-mouth. Separately from local contacts here in the state and abroad based on remote work I and others have done, we publish some notes of design work and software development that others do not which garners some attention from clients who acknowledge us as subject matter experts. This is also partially validated by press publications and industry awards. Additionally, we review requests for proposals where we think we can provide a valuable service, and we work on some internal products by reinvesting earnings into developing technologies from research and development efforts. Fun novel stuff that doesn't really exist in the open source world. In this wing of the business, we focus on competing technologies to proprietary solutions that exist in the wild. So, it takes some exceptional work to gain enough traction to stay in business, and I think by extension, that's why you don't see too many of these businesses stay afloat. We've been in business for maybe, I'm not sure now, 5 or 6 years. Not long. But we do so by doing things others don't, or can't. So in terms of market segmentation, we address solutions from a premium perspective. reply",

For instance, this comment would have fields like \"author\", \"date\", \"language\", and maybe \"ip\" to make it interpretable to the machines. You don't need that because the machines can figure it out without the annotations. A run-of-the-mill computer vision model can tag an image much better and much more accurately than most humans. reply",

          "text": "I squeaked a bunch of Choice (seems to be Ali's managed logistics) products in under the wire. Ten bags of stuff, some arriving just a few days before the de minimis tax exemption went away. All basically meeting or exceeding their delivery estimates - shipping time was about 6-8 days on average. Out of curiosity, I checked on a bunch of those listings a week later. Most were just 2-3x more expensive and said tariffs included. But one or two were unavailable to ship to the US as you saw. The one item I ordered that wasn't Choice but also not expensive enough to justify Fedex seems to have been shipped but got lost. The tracking stalled long enough that I got an automatically-approved refund. Glad I didn't have to play the blame game for a found item trying to clear customs after the exemption went away. I'm not planning on ordering anything else at the moment. But I imagine the longer the high tariff taxes stay in place, the more appealing Aliexpress (and specifically Choice) will become. The selection on Amazon and other US warehouses is going to dwindle as sellers avoid fronting the cost of paying high taxes to import items just to sit around, while taking the risk that the Mad King might have a different whim next week. Whereas direct from China purchases can pay the tariffs with cash in hand. reply",

          "text": "Like anyone new to a leadership role, it seems the director is conducting a kind of audit to both assess the current situation and establish their own footing — even though this is fundamentally a human/relationship-based process. From what you've described, there are a couple of likely possibilities: First, the director may still be gathering information to form an informed opinion about the team's capabilities. Alternatively, they might have already formed an initial impression and are now seeking confirmation through these interviews and interactions. In either case, I don't think there's anything here that should make you feel discouraged or take it personally. I completely understand that it can weigh on your mind — it's a common and often uncomfortable experience in the workplace. But it's not unusual, and it doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on you or your team's work. reply",

          "text": "Your post looked familiar and by looking at your past submissions I can see that the situation has been brewing for some time.  I can understand how you might be feeling at odds with your director's decisions. Since I don't know you, nor your director I can't judge your relative competencies, especially in the area of your specialty (which would be better if it were actually named). All I can go by is this and your prior submissions. It appears that the \"director\" is at least two levels above you in the organization structure. So whether you like it or not, his decisions are going to override yours. That's by virtue of the corporate pecking order. I also get the impression that you harbor some resentment towards this director. Perhaps you are upset that the director who hired you has been fired with no notice. Perhaps that is an indication that further up the management hierarchy things are even less to your liking. It is also possible that your expertise level in your specialty exceeds that of your director. But he is obviously viewed in a better light than you by the top levels of management. In one of your previous submissions you mention that you are trapped by 6x share value increase. So if the vesting is such that leaving in the near future is not an option, then your best option is to stop fighting. Try to understand where your director is coming from and instead of confronting, seek out ways to work together until such time you can afford to quit. You don't need to be right all the time. Just keep your exit horizon in sight and until then smile and be a good little team player . reply",

          "text": "Frankly, what you're describing just sounds normal to me after a decade+ at BigCo, and you just have to lean into it, embrace it. It's completely normal to have a formal interviewing process / loop with feedback forms and debrief sessions and stuff... but for candidates that pass that, they just earn a meeting/interview with the big boss who then singlehandedly makes the decision regardless of all the earlier feedback from lower level folks, and occasionally hires people they've worked with before completely bypassing the formal interview process + everybody else. It's also completely normal for big bosses to be in the weeds of the work and people two or three levels below them, either directly, or by telling managers under them exactly what to do with their reports. Essentially, the interviewing process and org chart / reporting lines are just there for show, and to fool naive folks, but actually it's totally normal for decisions to be made outside of the process, or by higher folks directly driving things several levels under them. I think you just have to embrace it, work directly with the director and everyone else and earn their trust, and don't expect to ever have autonomy/authority over anything in a company that you don't own. reply",

I'm looking for something in Developer Experience (DevEx), Engineering Productivity, or maybe Platform Engineering, depending on how the org's set up, or at a Developer Tooling (DevTools) company. I'm looking for a Senior/Staff role, where I can primarily work on Go (ideally 50% of my time) and hopefully contribute towards upskilling the organisation, and providing insights into how we're using internal/Open Source dependencies. I'm someone who thrives on being able to talk publicly about the work I'm doing, so would very much like to help the company to continue to have a public presence - https://www.jvt.me/archives/ and https://www.jvt.me/salary/ for some examples of my public work.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

Although my formal leadership roles span the past eight years, I've been influencing teams and improving products far longer—because true product evolution demands more than passive participation; it requires initiative, ownership, and vision. My background in development, DevOps, testing, and quality has allowed me to deliver strategic and tactical improvements while keeping my hands on the work. I manage Linux servers and adjust code when needed, staying closely connected to current technologies and practices.

Email: kiranksk0512@gmail.com Hi, I’m Sai Kiran, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo (graduating Dec 2025), currently seeking Summer 2025 internships, Fall co-ops, or full-time software engineering roles. My background includes backend microservices development using Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Docker, along with hands-on frontend experience using React.js, Flutter and Dart. I’ve worked as software developer for scalable systems in a production environment during my 2+ years at Air Arabia (via ISA), and contributed to projects that span cloud deployment, API development, and performance optimization. At UB, I’ve strengthened my understanding of algorithms, networking, system design, machine learning and modern software architecture through coursework and collaborative projects. I’ve also worked on several Python- and SQL-based projects, including a Seam Carving project focused on content-aware image resizing, and a hackathon project where I built an AI-powered code review assistant integrating cloud deployment, vector search, and LLM tooling. These projects helped me apply scripting, data manipulation, AI Agents creation, learning RAG and model integration in practical scenarios. I'm excited to bring my skills to a team building robust, user-impactful technology—whether in backend/frontend systems, cloud services, or AI-enhanced platforms. Happy to connect! reply",

While this was largely accidental, I have code running on the device you're using read to this, a little bit in Earth orbit, and some on science-fiction machines :) I have experience with desktop code, distributed code, backend code, some frontend, protocols, but also with setting up teams, working alongside management, product, marketing, legal. I've been involved in open-source forever, interacting with communities, presenting at conferences, writing technical and non-technical papers and blog entries, mentoring external contributors, ... Looking for a position where I could work on something both challenging and either open-source or useful to society (research, teaching, privacy, environment, etc.) reply",

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby.

My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end. Also, in my free time, I learn and share my knowledge by writing blogs, newsletters, Youtube videos, or speaking at conferences. reply",

          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

          "text": "I hit 40 this year. I have definitely noticed a slowdown even in the last few years. Before 30 I could pull 2-3 all-nighters a week without really feeling any ill effects. Then, maybe early-to-mid 30's I could only handle one per week, assuming I'd slept well otherwise. The sleep debt would be too high still and the next day I'd get headaches, feel extremely tired and unmotivated. Or I could sustain 2-4hrs of sleep a night for like 3-4 days, but again I'd pay for it if I didn't catch up (pretty sure I'm paying for it long-term anyways). Here at the end of my 30's I can't really do a full 40-hours straight without sleep anymore (16hr day, 8hr night, 16hr day, then sleep). If I don't get at least 2hrs overnight then that second day is mostly wasted, maybe I get 4hrs out of the 16. I've always known that sufficient sleep is important for your health, and I've tried to balance times of all-nighters with crashes to catch-up, but the allure of using the night as uninterrupted focus time is so strong when you work in modern corporate \"open-plan\" environments where always-on Slack/Teams presence is expected during business hours. reply",

Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\".

          "text": "Hack the hackathon. My follow-at-your-own-risk pro tip: Find a team not too much into wining and - connect with others. They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice.

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall.

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing. Have to say, both events (and I attended several of each) were exciting. . . they challenged me in a way I was unfortunately not used to (except in high school and college) and showed that others were actually interested and part of the solution.

          "text": "I think there's a natural process similar to gentrification in which as technology matures the hackathons promoting it transition into marketing-led events. I got into hackathons in the early 2010s when IoT was the hot new thing and saw the crowds change from hardcore technologists to mostly students and idea people. The fact is the same thing that what drew me in is what attracted them - opportunity and optimism. Sponsors expect ROI and once a technology is no longer experimental, the same tired projects tend to win because they are tried and true. I've been to a couple of good hackathons lately but they are more focused on vibe coding and tend to only run for 8-12 hours. These let you try out an idea or framework with little commitment but lack the depth of multi-day events. I've been attending an XR hackathon for almost a decade which still embodies the ethos, but it is a labor of love carried out by volunteers. These longer, challenging and intentional events can teach you more about teamwork and product in one weekend than a year of churning through tickets. reply",

Once you graduate, there's a lot fewer of those things lying around. Quote: > We need look no further than the \"hackathon,\" that sad facsimile of the days when we were all learning the basics so fast that the world could be ours with just a day or two of focused effort. Hype up an exciting atmosphere, assemble some folks with so few attachments in life that they have time to spend all weekend at a hackathon, and this ritual will summon up the old gods. The hackathon is the proof that people believe this can work, and it is the proof that it doesn't. reply",

They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

          "text": "First the good news: There is a relatively well beaten path to becoming an independent consultant/contractor who gets to pick and chose their clients and projects. You probably won't work on intellectually challenging or stimulating projects 100% of the time, but you can schedule them so that there's usually an interesting contract running in parallel to the ones that reliably pay the bills. There will be dry spells where you have nothing but boring work but as you get better and have a proven history of delivering, that work improves. Now the bad news: getting there takes a lot of work - most of it unrelated to technology - and requires a certain personality. You need to get out there and network till your ears bleed, get good at sales and marketing, manage the stress of not having a W2 salary and health insurance, learn how to bill clients and convince them to actually pay, maintain relationships with current and past coworkers, and a hundred other yaks you have to shave. It's death by a thousand cuts but if this lifestyle fits your personality, you can achieve a very interesting and varied career. If you spend your college years and summers building out that network, you can even start this process shortly after graduation but it is very risky. Depending on how the job market looks in a couple years, it might even be the optimal thing to do (it's what I did after the 2008 GFC), but this is not a path for the feint of heart. It is hard and much more stressful than collecting a paycheck. I was personally relieved to get a FTE position after years of consulting. reply",

There is a lot more research in other areas. For example, everyone seemed to forget about MuZero, but that was one of the most important breakthroughs in the last decade, because it was a model that could recursively search. So if you think about tasks like driving a car, a model that can predict the evolution of a physical system (much like MuZero can predict the evolution of the game board), and make a decision,  is going to perform much better than any of the vision based transformer models that are in cars today. But there are other areas of research as well, namely in hardware with specific instructions for general compute. reply",

          "text": "Sarama | Canine Language Specialist | On-site (San Francisco, CA) | Full Time | Must have a dog | praful@sarama.ai Company: We’re building smart collars and devices to decode dog communication—using audio, motion, and behavior data. Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift!

Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society. Attendi has built a strong user base with its API-first speech-to-text solutions and client SDKs, loved by healthcare professionals via integrations with electronic health record (EHR) vendors. Currently, users interact with our products only within their EHR systems — but why stop there? We want to enable them to benefit from our tools anytime, anywhere. As a Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer, you’ll play a key role in developing our new (greenfield) products to support this ambition: Attendi’s first external full-stack app — which we see as the healthcare sector’s notepad. Our aim is to make it the default write-layer for medical data. But it’s far more than a simple notepad: speech-to-text and machine learning will be deeply integrated. We have a dedicated team with fewer than 25 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We're post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market. Check out https://attendi.recruitee.com/o/senior-frontend-focused-full... for more details on the position. Feel free to send any questions to berend [at] attendi [dot] nl. reply",

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

Some other areas people use a lot of tools with sequential thinking\nMostly for workflows that I like:\n* start a PR with a summary of what I just did * slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed * pull this issue from sentry and fix it * Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it * pull this linear issue and do a first pass * pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code * Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model development\nEveryone seems to go for the hype but ease of use, practical pragmatic developer workflows, and high quality polished mcp servers are what we’re focused on\nLmk what you think! reply",

I'm obviously open to any suggestions for edits: Our app is used to authenticate users—specifically musicians—via the Instagram OAuth flow. We request access only to the instagram_business_basic permission and retrieve minimal public profile data, specifically the Instagram username. This information is used solely to associate an Instagram account with the corresponding user profile in our platform's database for identity verification purposes. Our role as a Tech Provider is limited to enabling musicians to link their verified Instagram accounts as a form of professional identity on our platform. This helps to ensure authenticity and trust among users, particularly industry professionals engaging with our artist-focused services. We do not collect, store, or process any private Instagram data. We do not publish content, provide analytics, or perform automated actions on behalf of users. The data retrieved is strictly limited to the public username field and is never shared with third parties. The user journey is as follows: 1. The user visits [REDACTED] and clicks the Connect Instagram button. 2. They are redirected to the official Instagram OAuth dialog to authorize access to their public profile. 3. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected back to our app, which then makes a request to the Instagram Graph API endpoint https://graph.instagram.com/me using the access token. 4. We extract the username field from the response and associate it with the user’s profile in our database to complete the verification process. Users have full control over their accounts and data. If a user wishes to remove their account and associated data from our platform, they can follow the instructions provided here: [REDACTED]. This implementation strictly follows Instagram's platform guidelines and privacy principles by minimizing data usage, requiring explicit user authorization, and ensuring transparency and user control. 1.

Move to the top? Note that IG is used by many musicians and so why IG specifically, ie, really develop the last part of the last sentence? That Additional Information is also really key, yet is at the bottom. I'd suggest making it really clear at the top: key info, key reassurances, then get into details.

          "text": "Leaving Britain after 13 years and moving back to Italy. I thought it would be more traumatic than it has proved to be. I missed the sun, the Mediterranean foodstuffs and it is such a change of pace to have moved to a 50k city from the pandemonium that is London. When I left 13 years ago I was younger, more excited at the prospect of career and UK felt like a step ahead. Now I grew up, grew to hate cities, corporate life and found Italy a healthier and happier country for the next chapter. Also, a very underrated thing not many expats talk about, I missed not feeling like a stranger, an immigrant, a fish out of water. That’s a background emotion that never goes away, however integrated and fluent in the local culture you are. reply",

          "text": "In IT there are three highly generalized routes to consider: * Low barrier of entry jobs, like most web developer jobs. Good luck, it’s a race to the bottom but it’s also where most of the jobs are. The goal here is to pad your resume with nonsense and compete with hundreds of other people that are also padding their resumes. * Jobs that require licenses and/or certifications. These will be jobs like cloud infrastructure support, cyber defense, routing/switching, project management, and operations. These jobs are harder to qualify for and are fewer than the prior bullet point but are a much safer bet and tend to pay more. * High talent jobs, which include the gaming industry and more engineering type jobs. These jobs are the fewest and not as secure as the prior category. They also are the most variable in compensation, but they tend to be the most fulfilling for people with high intelligence or high creativity. Know which way you want to go because the means to achieve these jobs differ radically. reply",

The filter/apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster's auto updating window. Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense. Want to buy a generic \"graphing calculator\" for $126 which is definitely not a Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus? Here you go! [1]. Look, you're not fooling anybody here.

All sites as viewed on desktop, on mobile this would likely not work out. I also want to echo the command line tools mention in another comment. GDB's TUI is reasonable for my use, but after some experience this recently posted terminal debugger might be better: https://github.com/al13n321/nnd via https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43905185 Also the hex editor I am currently using, despite some problems: https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex An example of an information dense GUI that might be a bit overwhelming is Ghidra: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidra (page includes a basic screenshot, you can fill your screen(s) with as many sub windows and information panes as you want) As a side note, while trying to find examples I realized just how few websites there are (any more?) that show a lot of information at the same time. Worst recent offender is YouTube's redesign with only 3 video tiles in a row on a 1440p screen, luckily easily fixed via a ublock rule. reply",

I think through common problems with 4o, tough problems with o3, I copy all of Svelte's docs into 4o ( https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ ) to get good Svelte 5-focused feedback, I have 4o code-review what Cursor writes from time to time, I have 4o, sometimes o3, generate \"precise\" prompts that I'll give to Cursor when me talking off-the-cuff to Cursor doesn't get good results after a few attempts. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet so I might be misusing Cursor, or not making enough use of its rules system, or something. I feel like I get good value for my ChatGPT subscription. I don't feel like I get good value for my Cursor subscription, but I also still feel like keeping it because $20 to type a lot less is still pretty nice. I would be upset if I only had a Cursor subscription and no access to ChatGPT. I am pretty hesitant to pay for AI à la carte. I feel much better about working within the limitations of a known subscription cost. reply",

          "text": "I settled on gptel, which is an LLM package for Emacs. It's kind of a mix of both approaches: 1. You have chats right there in the editor, easy to copy/paste and manage context/history without switching to a browser. You can also quickly add files or portions of files to the context or remove them again. 2. You can choose which model you want to use for what, granted you have an API key. 3. You can quickly highlight some code and ask for a change to it, which along with managed context is powerful. I tried auto complete again and again but it doesn't work for me. At first I think \"yeah, that's what I wanted to write\", and then I have to look closer to realise it's not, and that completely breaks my flow and concentration. I can always write some pseudo code and proactively convert it to real code, I like to be in the driver seat. Context management is really central to my workflow, I manage it like a hawk. Models tend to deteriorate as context content increases, in my experience, so I really try to keep it narrow. For that reason, and because our clients didn't sign up for their code to be sent to Anthropic et al, I _mostly_ use models like I would use StackOverflow, not to generate non-trivial code I'd actually use. But having the chats in my editor is really invaluable for me. Powerful text wrangling features make a difference in both speed and motivation. I use it pretty heavily with pretty much only the high-end models and pay about $15 per month. reply",

My take is that most people did not invest the little time necessary to get acustomed to its workflow. My advices for aider are: - familiarize yourself with the chat modes (architect, code, ask) - familiarize yourself with the edit modes (diff, whole, etc) and know which to use for a given model. Indeed not all models handle all modes equally well. - make the code one feature at a time, by small chunks if needed, by limiting the contxt to the relevant files. - practice to learn how to best phrase stuff. - write you coding preferences into aider convention files. Things like \"always use type hints, beartype for type checking, python click for the cli, add many comments\". I'm mainly doing python and with proper comments and type hints it's really easy for models to write code that works with the rest of the repo even with only a few files in its context. reply",

          "text": "I've been trying out Windsurf for the past two weeks with VS Code and I find it (and Copilot) very helpful, but also very annoying. Occasionally, the windsurf command overlays (explain, accept, etc...) will get stuck and make it impossible to see the code until I restart VS Code. But the biggest problem that I have is with automatic auto-complete. With both Windsurf and copilot, I have trouble figuring out when / if an autocompleted function or line of code will be accepted or generated. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to integrate my coding style with the tools, but I'm still trying because the work has been impressive thus far. I'm now also trying the same with with Claude-code, which has been pretty useful too. It managed to figure out and explain a fairly technical code base (a few DNA processing algorithms). I haven't tried with with code I'm unfamiliar with yet. So, my verdict so far: well worth the effort to try it and learn what's available. It's not that expensive to try. If it can help automate somethings (documentation and tests, for example), that's what I'm really hoping to use the AI assistants for. It works for actual coding too, but I still prefer to provide the main foundation. reply",

The \"context-in-the-codebase\" thing for AI-based IDEsis overrated IMO. To extract the most from it, you have to remember to @mention the files. If you don't remember to @mention specific files, the agent simply tries to perform searches (i.e., it has access to that tool) on the files and folders until it gets some results... and will usually keep broadening the search until it does. It works well enough I suppose. But I still find myself beginning new chats (for example, per feature) because the model still loses its place, and with all the code/lint fixes it does, it starts to lose context. Then you're right back having to @mention more files to ensure the model knows how to structure your front end, back end, etc. (Please excuse any misnamed development terms.) :-) reply",

You use slash commands to add whatever you need to the context (single files, directories, highlighted selections, etc) and interact with a conventional chat interface from there. The prompt library also lets you store convenient system prompts if you have a diverse task domain. You can of course use their new agentic features which can automate a lot of the context management via tool use, but I find that to be a waste of time and resources for the majority of tasks I care about. I currently manage my own fork to use a custom FIM completion provider I built, that tends to do most of the heavy lifting for me in terms of anything AI-generated. reply",

I've haven't seen better results switching to paid models. - For generating large swaths of code, I recently went back to copy/pasting into Claude Projects, with my github project hooked up and relevant files added to context. For a moderately complex component, it usually takes 5-15 generated versions to work, though I end up adjusting my specs a bit in the process. This is still faster than using the agent. Claude Code might get similar results, but I already pay for Anthropic so haven't tried it out. - If I'm picking up a new library, concept, or pattern, I usually chat with Claude to level up my knowledge.

Probably better than chat, since it could touch all css, html and JS that are sprinkled around in different files. But that's not my main job. Overall, I think my work is mainly \"deep\" problem solving. I don't necessarily produce much code per day. The chat is a helpful aid for thinking, copilot not as much. Another thing I've noticed is that writing the code myself has often a net longterm benefit. For a while I was generating all kinds of python scripts for converting data between formats etc. I'm not good with python, but LLMs are, so I just used that. Until I ran into a wall too many times. Eventually every \"temporary script\" kept growing until LLMs could no longer provide what I wanted, and then I was stuck. I would have to go through the whole code from start and internalize it fully to be able to get the thing done. I would have saved time doing it myself from the start. So now I mainly use the chat just to ask about available functions, syntax, etc, but rarely use the generated code. IDEs are not great for this kind of approach in my experience. reply",

          "text": "To answer your question directly \"it depends\". There are a lot of different subtasks to coding. Defining requirements, sketching/discussing architecture, coming up with a technical plan, executing it, creating tests, etc. Different interfaces are better at different things. Cursor/Windsurf agentic flows can be great at well defined tasks that are directly actionable within the abstractions of the existing codebase. If you want to build new things, you need to be a little more methodical, and this can mean using chat interfaces to have a dialogue with AI. I use RepoPrompt [0] + Cursor Tab Complete (since it's easily the best on the market), but I don't use the in-IDE cursor/windsurf agentic flows unless I have a small task I need doing where I can describe it perfectly. RepoPrompt is an underhyped context selection tool that includes - A prompt formatter so you can easily dump it + prompts into chat windows - A built-in diff format prompt template that gets auto-inserted so you can auto-apply the resulting changes. - A unique \"Chat\" mode that's an API frontend for multi-turn conversations with dynamic code context, templated prompting, etc. - An incredible \"delegate edit\" feature where the results of your conversation get sent to cheaper/smaller LLMs to actually enact. The cost savings and increase in coherency are unreal. It's not unusual for a single turn to generate something like 50 specific edits across a dozen files that are completely coherent. Right now my main workflow is to discuss architecture with a context dump + prompt to o3, settle on a solution, build a PRD, give that to 2.5 Pro to create a more granular plan, make edits, then send it back to 2.5 Pro to delegate edits to Flash 2.0/DeepSeekV3/o4-mini. Not unusal to see it produce 20-50 edits across a dozen files with perfect coherency. Any fixups or minor things I do in cursor. There are also the CLI agentic code tools. I find claude code to be like a more powerful version of the cursor agent flow. They're great for directed tasks that involve a lot of exploration, like understanding how you need to integrate with some submodule on the other side of the codebase.

To answer why I don't use chat at all for coding anymore, some benefits of IDE / CLI agents: Copy pasting into chat apps don't allow for agentic runs (ie run bash commands, edit code, validate with linting / testing before marking task as 'complete'). I can mostly just write my descriptive task (usually with code references if they aren't already there in clinerules / claude.md, etc.) and come back after a short walk or drinking some tea and check the code or just check at runtime to ask it to fix up the code. This is honestly very similar to \"waiting for code to compile.\" For reference, I've used the following to make production code changes: - Cursor: which when Claude 3.5 was out seemed to be the best AI IDE, but the changes they've made around agent mode and 3.7 haven't really worked super well for me. Migrated to claude code after 3.7 came out. - Claude Code: Very good, I generally just ran it in dangerous mode and it could accomplish tasks fairly well. Wrote a decent Claude.md file as well. Only con is that it got expensive quickly. On the order of $3-5 per session which would accomplish a single task. - Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Moved to it yesterday, it's been doing a good job and is effectively free right now using my own API key for Gemini.

You constantly sitting hitting the escape key try to get their auto-complete suggestion to go away. Most of the time is it guessing where wrong and is mostly useless. The biggest issue is when you try to use a class that has properties. When you press the dot after the class name normally the IDE will list the public properties on the class.

As clever as this AI autocomplete can be, i really hate it because I can no longer rely on that my IDE is telling the truth about what properties and functions there is exist on a class. and if you are the type of programmer that like to put empty lines in your code for readability.

VS Code is very quickly catching up to Cursor as well (added tab-driven completions). Also you don’t have to be right on the edge of things. You can be, or you can wait for the dust to settle. Claude Code / OpenAI Codex and the agent modes are probably the edge now. Also if you’re still using a terminal (who isn’t), try Warp. It’s improved a ton over the last year, support more niche shells like Fish now. It’s actually a really “fluid” AI chat integration, because it smartly figures out when what you’re typing is not a command but a prompt. (It’s probably also on the edge, I haven’t figured out how to tell it “you’re wrong” when it asks for a permission for example, I have to “cancel” the chat). reply",

Getting started is the hardest part, like many are saying, its simpler when you can rely on your network. Everything is about trust, by this, start reaching out to people who already trust you, there is a chance that this will get you either a project or a referral. Once you build a portfolio, you will keep getting these referrals. In my case, I have got most of our contracts by sending cold emails, I have got a few customers through the \"Who's looking for freelancers\" posts + many others by just talking to people. Lately, market is flooded with AI-generated stuff and fake job seekers which is causing people to distrust others, it seems harder to get contracts through cold outreach and the referrals we have got have done wonders. reply",

The biggest risk that clients face is not the cost of the project per-se, but missed delivery and/or poor results.  So, in a sense, what you're really selling is not technical acumen, but trust and reliability. Yes, project failure can often be laid at the feet of the client. But, IMO, good professionals contract developers are responsible for pushing back on vague and/or changing requirements.  Part of your job is to look underneath what the client says to discern what he actually needs.  The goal should be to and deliver something that is both useful and fulfills the client's goals.

Make it easy for visitors to join your mailing list for updates (maybe offer them a free whitepaper for joining). Find out where potential customers hang out (whether online or meatspace) and hang out there with them. Ask questions. Discover their pain points and address them. Look for sites that list contracts (yes, there are a bunch) and comb through them carefully and frequently. Don't try to be all things to all people, i.e. focus on customers and projects that can use your strengths. Create a free product and release it to get customers, then try to upsell them on extra features. Knowing what type of software you specialize in would make it easier to give more specific suggestions. Government contracts are way different from websites for mom-and-pop shops which are themselves way different from embedded systems. Each of those spaces has their own challenges and quirks. reply",

          "text": "Hi codingclaws, I own my eponymous firm, Andrew McWatters & Co. ( https://www.andrewmcwatters.com ) in Phoenix, Arizona. We have bench engineer staff and I am the only one who does sales. I write the contracts, as well as do the design work and engineering alongside my coworkers. I consider us a software development firm, but there are other companies that call themselves \"agencies\" in the valley. They do a bit more full-service work, while we focus on custom software specifically. The answer is that I work alongside a network of developers who have an established history of contacts here in Arizona, and I've also been in the industry for a number of years and previously worked at a large number of companies doing a mix of professional services work, contract, and full-time employment. That's the long way of saying that I obtain business by word-of-mouth. Separately from local contacts here in the state and abroad based on remote work I and others have done, we publish some notes of design work and software development that others do not which garners some attention from clients who acknowledge us as subject matter experts. This is also partially validated by press publications and industry awards. Additionally, we review requests for proposals where we think we can provide a valuable service, and we work on some internal products by reinvesting earnings into developing technologies from research and development efforts. Fun novel stuff that doesn't really exist in the open source world. In this wing of the business, we focus on competing technologies to proprietary solutions that exist in the wild. So, it takes some exceptional work to gain enough traction to stay in business, and I think by extension, that's why you don't see too many of these businesses stay afloat. We've been in business for maybe, I'm not sure now, 5 or 6 years. Not long. But we do so by doing things others don't, or can't. So in terms of market segmentation, we address solutions from a premium perspective. reply",

          "text": "I actually made a game with conversations recently. Originally it was flipped (player to the left). Something felt off so I got curious and realized the same thing you did. The norm for comics is the person you are speaking to is on the right. Because dialogue is read from left to right and you don't want to cross the tails. The brain views the person on the right as being approached and the left as the one entering the room. It's inversed for manga. I actually started with artwork (first person, other character on the right). But I flipped it to match messaging norms on mobile. A more obvious one if you play MOBAs is that your team is always at the bottom and the opponent is top. Yet the game is always able to reverse this for your opponent as well. But most of the time when you open a messaging app, it's to read messages. Then the eye goes top left. There are few instances where the first thing you do is read your own messages. From a utilization perspective it makes sense too. Fun fact though, a lot of UX is adopted from Japanese culture too. Like QRs and emojis. The western style is barcodes and smileys. So it could well be following the manga style. reply",

I've solved quite a few very challenging technical problems, and made products that users loved. However, I've had to come to the unfortunate conclusion that I'm a very good engineer but not a good enough entrepreneur, so I'm looking to join a team and focus on what I excel at. As an example, I recently wrote my own game engine for Flutter in C that was around ~24x as fast as Unity (it wasn't quite a fair fight, but still). I love learning new things, and I'm an exceptionally hard worker. Even if my background doesn't perfectly align with what you have in mind, please reach out; I will be a great addition to your team! reply",

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

My background includes backend microservices development using Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Docker, along with hands-on frontend experience using React.js, Flutter and Dart. I’ve worked as software developer for scalable systems in a production environment during my 2+ years at Air Arabia (via ISA), and contributed to projects that span cloud deployment, API development, and performance optimization. At UB, I’ve strengthened my understanding of algorithms, networking, system design, machine learning and modern software architecture through coursework and collaborative projects. I’ve also worked on several Python- and SQL-based projects, including a Seam Carving project focused on content-aware image resizing, and a hackathon project where I built an AI-powered code review assistant integrating cloud deployment, vector search, and LLM tooling. These projects helped me apply scripting, data manipulation, AI Agents creation, learning RAG and model integration in practical scenarios. I'm excited to bring my skills to a team building robust, user-impactful technology—whether in backend/frontend systems, cloud services, or AI-enhanced platforms. Happy to connect! reply",

Email: kennynguyenx[at]gmail.com I’m Kenny, a full-stack software engineer looking for junior opportunities. I most recently worked in a UX-centric engineering role at a gaming company and have prior experience at an early-stage start-up developing a biotech SaaS. I have a graduate-level education in information science from an R1 university alongside degrees and research experience in the health sciences. To be very transparent, I’ve been unemployed for a while after operations for my previous company moved overseas and it's been tough trying to get back into the industry. I took time off to refine my computer science knowledge and get more confident in my engineering skills. I am really looking to break back into tech in a less design-focused role. Please send me a message if you know of any opportunities! Open to connecting on LinkedIn also. :) Thank you! reply",

I'm open to changing roles to work somewhere that will teach me something I want to learn and give me more freedom, both financially and in where and when I work. More precisely, I'm open to switching to a role where I can work more autonomously and remotely, and with good pay. I also greatly appreciate simplicity, which I feel is a criteria that can sometimes get forgotten at large tech companies. I'm an excellent communicator, that is probably my greatest strength. In particular, I'm a very good writer, and do well in environments with lots of written communication. I'm curious, I'm honest, and I'm kind. My favorite feedback from a manager that I've gotten is that I get along with everyone. I greatly appreciate logical rigor, and make a sincere effort to regularly examine my beliefs, in order to discard useless or false ones. I have a solid mathematical background - my undergrad and master's were both in mathematics, with a specialization in theoratical computer science and discrete math, and I regularly practice maths, often with friends, for the fun of it.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I loved studying classics like SICP, HtDP, EOPL, etc. and using sites like Project Euler. I did not love boring things like \"applying for jobs\" and \"getting good grades in history\". (In one case I failed a class on operating systems because I missed a test while building an actual operating system. The professor agreed to bump it to D+.) So no Stanford->FAANG easy life, but I've since grown up and am an excellent dev, at 1/3 the cost! One of the FAANGs interview feedback was \"that's the best answer I've ever gotten on this question\", where I'd shown a usually linear-time algorithm (for people that memorize them) had a O(1) solution. But they didn't like my C++ brace placement or whatever. Tough world! I look forward to becoming way richer in exchange for writing awesome code. reply",

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end. Also, in my free time, I learn and share my knowledge by writing blogs, newsletters, Youtube videos, or speaking at conferences. reply",

I spent the early part of my career at early stage startups and have spent the past 8 years or so doing mostly greenfield projects on a contract basis. I've done a lot in the dev tools space, and with graphically intensive web applications (e.g. domain-specific CAD tools). I'm working on some LLM infrastructure tooling that I designed and have partly built that I plan to commercialize so I'm looking for something pretty part time. I think I could be very useful on the right project, but I also have a lot of constraints on what I'm looking for (part-time, could be AI-related but won't sign restrictive contracts in that space). For a person/team that can be flexible on this kind of stuff definitely reach out, happy to talk! I'll consult for reasonable rates too if you want advice/second opinion/ideas/approaches for building AI products. reply",

          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

          "text": "I hit 40 this year. I have definitely noticed a slowdown even in the last few years. Before 30 I could pull 2-3 all-nighters a week without really feeling any ill effects. Then, maybe early-to-mid 30's I could only handle one per week, assuming I'd slept well otherwise. The sleep debt would be too high still and the next day I'd get headaches, feel extremely tired and unmotivated. Or I could sustain 2-4hrs of sleep a night for like 3-4 days, but again I'd pay for it if I didn't catch up (pretty sure I'm paying for it long-term anyways). Here at the end of my 30's I can't really do a full 40-hours straight without sleep anymore (16hr day, 8hr night, 16hr day, then sleep). If I don't get at least 2hrs overnight then that second day is mostly wasted, maybe I get 4hrs out of the 16. I've always known that sufficient sleep is important for your health, and I've tried to balance times of all-nighters with crashes to catch-up, but the allure of using the night as uninterrupted focus time is so strong when you work in modern corporate \"open-plan\" environments where always-on Slack/Teams presence is expected during business hours. reply",

Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\".

          "text": "Hack the hackathon. My follow-at-your-own-risk pro tip: Find a team not too much into wining and - connect with others. They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice. I think it has always been like this.

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP).

Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

          "text": "I haven't been to a hackathon in a long time, but the best ones I remember were explicitly about getting designers and developers to build something concrete but simple for a good cause. I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing. Have to say, both events (and I attended several of each) were exciting. . . they challenged me in a way I was unfortunately not used to (except in high school and college) and showed that others were actually interested and part of the solution. The major plus of the budget hackathons was that we got to see students (middle schoolers, IIRC) who were doing whatever it was they were doing and having a blast.

Once you graduate, there's a lot fewer of those things lying around. Quote: > We need look no further than the \"hackathon,\" that sad facsimile of the days when we were all learning the basics so fast that the world could be ours with just a day or two of focused effort. Hype up an exciting atmosphere, assemble some folks with so few attachments in life that they have time to spend all weekend at a hackathon, and this ritual will summon up the old gods. The hackathon is the proof that people believe this can work, and it is the proof that it doesn't. reply",

These are binge-programming days/nights when the engineers finally don't need to work on tickets, and don't have to follow the due processes. Corollary: if your company promises to have a hackathon one day, it's best to get prepared and have a bunch of good ideas well ahead of time. reply",

          "text": "I think there's a natural process similar to gentrification in which as technology matures the hackathons promoting it transition into marketing-led events. I got into hackathons in the early 2010s when IoT was the hot new thing and saw the crowds change from hardcore technologists to mostly students and idea people. The fact is the same thing that what drew me in is what attracted them - opportunity and optimism. Sponsors expect ROI and once a technology is no longer experimental, the same tired projects tend to win because they are tried and true. I've been to a couple of good hackathons lately but they are more focused on vibe coding and tend to only run for 8-12 hours. These let you try out an idea or framework with little commitment but lack the depth of multi-day events. I've been attending an XR hackathon for almost a decade which still embodies the ethos, but it is a labor of love carried out by volunteers. These longer, challenging and intentional events can teach you more about teamwork and product in one weekend than a year of churning through tickets. reply",

          "text": "Seeing some good comments and will add to the pile. IMO it's not a \"now\" thing. There's a natural ad-hoc, close proximity vibe that some gatherings have. They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

The hackathons I remember as a college student were different. They were much more free form. You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box. Getting the prize was fun, but a working artifact was much more satisfying. That’s why we did it. So, yes, it’s too commercial these days. reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

          "text": "Sarama | Canine Language Specialist | On-site (San Francisco, CA) | Full Time | Must have a dog | praful@sarama.ai Company: We’re building smart collars and devices to decode dog communication—using audio, motion, and behavior data. Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift! (we aren't able to give a cash bonus just yet soon though) reply",

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society. Attendi has built a strong user base with its API-first speech-to-text solutions and client SDKs, loved by healthcare professionals via integrations with electronic health record (EHR) vendors. Currently, users interact with our products only within their EHR systems — but why stop there? We want to enable them to benefit from our tools anytime, anywhere. As a Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer, you’ll play a key role in developing our new (greenfield) products to support this ambition: Attendi’s first external full-stack app — which we see as the healthcare sector’s notepad. Our aim is to make it the default write-layer for medical data. But it’s far more than a simple notepad: speech-to-text and machine learning will be deeply integrated. We have a dedicated team with fewer than 25 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We're post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market. Check out https://attendi.recruitee.com/o/senior-frontend-focused-full... for more details on the position. Feel free to send any questions to berend [at] attendi [dot] nl. reply",

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have >500 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

          "text": "I squeaked a bunch of Choice (seems to be Ali's managed logistics) products in under the wire. Ten bags of stuff, some arriving just a few days before the de minimis tax exemption went away. All basically meeting or exceeding their delivery estimates - shipping time was about 6-8 days on average. Out of curiosity, I checked on a bunch of those listings a week later. Most were just 2-3x more expensive and said tariffs included. But one or two were unavailable to ship to the US as you saw. The one item I ordered that wasn't Choice but also not expensive enough to justify Fedex seems to have been shipped but got lost. The tracking stalled long enough that I got an automatically-approved refund. Glad I didn't have to play the blame game for a found item trying to clear customs after the exemption went away. I'm not planning on ordering anything else at the moment. But I imagine the longer the high tariff taxes stay in place, the more appealing Aliexpress (and specifically Choice) will become. The selection on Amazon and other US warehouses is going to dwindle as sellers avoid fronting the cost of paying high taxes to import items just to sit around, while taking the risk that the Mad King might have a different whim next week. Whereas direct from China purchases can pay the tariffs with cash in hand. reply",

I have another script that uses Gemini to create map files, and that helps Claude find the right parts of the codebase quickly. It's able to do quite sophisticated bug fixes in a mature and unusual codebase (it's a deployment tool for desktop apps), and the quality of the produced code is high. One thing I miss from Aider is speech recognition integration. When you're alone at home it's great to be able to speak what you want instead of typing it. I'm pretty happy with it. The next big upgrade would be deep IDE integration, complete with the ability to search the IDE indexes, navigate around using cross-references and the like. reply",

Ask it to run checks + tests before / after every task, and add those commands to the \"no permission needed list\" – this improves quality by a lot 3. Ask it to do TDD, but manually check the actual test is correct 4. Every time it finishes something solid: git commit manually, /compact context (saves hella $$$ + seems to improve focus) Honestly I treat it like a junior programmer I'm pairing with. If you pay attention, you can catch it being stupid early and get it back on track. Best when you know exactly what you want, it's just boring work.

          "text": "If I'm being generous to the director, they've got a lot of experience in this specialty and they are probably familiar with how people bullshit their way into specialty positions when the people interviewing for it don't know different. It's not unreasonable for them to be involved in hiring decisions for people that report into them; right? Maybe try to get them involved in earlier, so it feels more like collaboration and less like second guessing. If they're an up or down vote, it would be better for them to be involved before an offer; and it would be better if they're in the main loop. You may want to put them towards the end of the day and end the loop early if there's a clear consensus no from early interviews. As an unrelated 3rd party, I would say, go ahead and lean in and ask for help with the specialty work that needs doing that your team is missing expertise in.   If they get roped into doing specialty work and they'd rather be directing, then they're more motivated about finding an acceptable candidate. reply",

          "text": "Your post looked familiar and by looking at your past submissions I can see that the situation has been brewing for some time.  I can understand how you might be feeling at odds with your director's decisions. Since I don't know you, nor your director I can't judge your relative competencies, especially in the area of your specialty (which would be better if it were actually named). All I can go by is this and your prior submissions. It appears that the \"director\" is at least two levels above you in the organization structure. So whether you like it or not, his decisions are going to override yours. That's by virtue of the corporate pecking order. I also get the impression that you harbor some resentment towards this director. Perhaps you are upset that the director who hired you has been fired with no notice. Perhaps that is an indication that further up the management hierarchy things are even less to your liking. It is also possible that your expertise level in your specialty exceeds that of your director. But he is obviously viewed in a better light than you by the top levels of management. In one of your previous submissions you mention that you are trapped by 6x share value increase. So if the vesting is such that leaving in the near future is not an option, then your best option is to stop fighting. Try to understand where your director is coming from and instead of confronting, seek out ways to work together until such time you can afford to quit. You don't need to be right all the time. Just keep your exit horizon in sight and until then smile and be a good little team player . reply",

          "text": "Like anyone new to a leadership role, it seems the director is conducting a kind of audit to both assess the current situation and establish their own footing — even though this is fundamentally a human/relationship-based process. From what you've described, there are a couple of likely possibilities: First, the director may still be gathering information to form an informed opinion about the team's capabilities. Alternatively, they might have already formed an initial impression and are now seeking confirmation through these interviews and interactions. In either case, I don't think there's anything here that should make you feel discouraged or take it personally. I completely understand that it can weigh on your mind — it's a common and often uncomfortable experience in the workplace. But it's not unusual, and it doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on you or your team's work. reply",

          "text": "Frankly, what you're describing just sounds normal to me after a decade+ at BigCo, and you just have to lean into it, embrace it. It's completely normal to have a formal interviewing process / loop with feedback forms and debrief sessions and stuff... but for candidates that pass that, they just earn a meeting/interview with the big boss who then singlehandedly makes the decision regardless of all the earlier feedback from lower level folks, and occasionally hires people they've worked with before completely bypassing the formal interview process + everybody else. It's also completely normal for big bosses to be in the weeds of the work and people two or three levels below them, either directly, or by telling managers under them exactly what to do with their reports. Essentially, the interviewing process and org chart / reporting lines are just there for show, and to fool naive folks, but actually it's totally normal for decisions to be made outside of the process, or by higher folks directly driving things several levels under them. I think you just have to embrace it, work directly with the director and everyone else and earn their trust, and don't expect to ever have autonomy/authority over anything in a company that you don't own. reply",
