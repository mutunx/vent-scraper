        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm exploring moving away from work with VC-backed B2B SaaS startups and towards working with B2C businesses on Main Street.<p>For anyone else who's felt inclined to make a similar pivot - any advice? Particularly when it comes to remaining challenged, informed, and translating valuable hype-cycle concepts to people who don't care about hype.<p>While it's interesting to play with shiny toys, helping investors make money by creating products related to the hype-cycle de jour that get used by other B2B SaaS companies just feels soulless.<p>(My background is in GTM systems and data analytics mostly, but I think the question applies to anyone)</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Having worked in both startups funded by VC's (or wishing to be), and for businesses not part of that, the primary difference is in the attitude towards boring technology.  Main Street is not really any better at seeing through hype cycles than anyone else, but they are less up-to-date on what is currently hyped, and they also are more likely to think that they hired the programmer to make technical decisions, rather than wanting to make those technical decisions themselves.  They have other (often equally technical) decisions to concentrate on, in different areas, so they are wanting you to just Make It Work. The downside is they are unimpressed with refactoring, updating to new versions, and the like.  The upside is they are ok with you using boring technology that works, even at times when a VC-backed tech company would insist on something new and overcomplicated. Also, the pay is ok, but honestly it's not going to be as high as in VC-backed employers. reply",

Leaving corporate tech jobs is already a big enough hit to TC. Getting out of VC-funded tech very often means a dramatic change in life style. The VC world might be insane, but so is the comp. It's not just the money. The biggest thing I've notice in my career is that, as a general rule, employers value you (or any resource for that matter) in proportion to how much they pay for you. Often people have the illusion that getting paid $80k a year when you used to make $300k will mean that your employer will recognize that you are a tremendous value. They won't. they'll see you and treat you as a low tier worker that can easily be replaced, has timed breaks and 30 minutes for lunch. reply",

Sounds like the folk wisdom that, by default, employers/clients tend to only value you how much they're paying you. If they had to pay a lot extra for you, the wisdom goes, they will imagine that you must have been worth it, and will take you more seriously. If they paid bargain basement price for you, well, I suppose the same psychology applies. (I was reminded of this folk wisdom last week, by a couple hints in an interview.  It's a bit tricky to filter out startup employers who only want midrange commodity skillsets, when you're willing to take a lower salary in exchange for meaningful equity.  While many of them are thinking of workers as generic commodities (and necessary evils, to the real stars who are the founders), and valuing these hires based on salary they are willing to entertain.) reply",

I’ve worked at only one startup. We IPO’d. I did pretty good and I joined a unicorn at like series B. Enough to go a decade figuring out what I want to work on next. Most of my other friends went to work at other startups. Most of them went bust and they made nothing but their base salary (and a couple of them got screwed on that too). So unless someone’s working at an actual unicorn like I was it’s really no guarantee. FWIW I made 8x on my latest shares, and multiples on that on earliest. Some people I know who had been there a few years more than me walked away with many more Ms which ain’t bad for 6-8 years of work. But that is SUPER lucky. It has sort of ruined my outlook too because I have no interest making 250k base + 200k RSUs, and I have zero interest in most of these current startups that I have a good hunch will not work out. And 400k isn’t that meaningful anymore, I’d rather live off interest or work as a barista if my own startup doesn’t work out. reply",

I see so much opportunity for a small medium business consultation in the analytics and process space but these companies are like really strapped for money and largely set in their ways in my experience. In my experience, people are open to solving their problems. It’s just the money is hard making it financially viable so it’s just the big money is just like an order of magnitude smaller. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I think the general level of sort of like process thinking and data driven decision making in tech is at just like a higher baseline than on Main Street A lot of my discussions are challenging how to sort of like present the problem in a way that somebody that doesn’t have decades of experience and operations understands. Another challenge that I face regularly with Main Street companies is just people seem to be happy like they’re not trying to continuously optimize like I’m used to doing coming for a big tech. Even when it’s easy to present like positive ROI opportunities there’s just like a comfort with the way things are done and a lot of people seem just happy governed by their scaling factors in exchange for that that comfort. TLDR; challenges are financial and mentality. reply",

Normally too early for VC, and often very shiny thing, or polishing things expected to be shiny in the future. I've only once worked on main street when I was managing the app for a pizza chain. One day, sitting in a quarterly planning meeting for the pizza company, they were discussing changes they could make to the app and the comment that stood out in my head was \"we forecast this change could help us sell x% more garlic bread\". In my head I thought, \"I don't care how much garlic bread we sell...this is not why I'm on the planet\". I know not every mains st. business is selling pizza, and lots of B2B companies, VC backed or not, would not excite me. You're right, helping investors make money isn't very compelling, and I think B2B, has that kind of focus, but many ventures aren't B2B SaaS. There is lots going on in health, energy, space, etc. right now.  I do expect many of these bubbles will pop, but is there something there that interests you?

Since they couldn't change it without risking breaking a customer they were migrating one customer at a time to a classic RDBMS. (There were like 200 customers, each of which is a company you've probably heard of). Many will go \"you need a proper ontology\" at which point just use a RDBMS. Ontologies are an absolute tarpit, as the semantic web showed. The graph illusion is similar to that academic delusion \"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.\" which is one of those quips that makes you appreciate just how theoretical some theoreticians really are. reply",

Most of the time all I need is just a csv-like structure of the data I'm working with and I had a very difficult time with just getting something like that. Joining tables tended to be difficult where the pivot points between relationships was rather semantically unbounded, so it was difficult for me to create a reasonably rigid mental model of the data I was working with. That was especially noticeable in some of the API documentation I worked with -- where a simple REST-like API just gives a simple, usually flat, json... graphql api responses were deeply nested and often in implementation-dependent ways[1] of thousands of lines. Which has IME made explorability practically impossible. GraphQL implementations have consistently felt like a hobby project where implementing it in an API becomes a thing to put on a resume rather than making a functionally useful API.

To make the agents better at planning and understanding the context of the page it can search the graph for relevant information and expand through the graph for more context. This works remarkably well. I think our agents (when they have interacted a bit w the page) are some of the best browser agents I have tested.

          "text": "Neo4j has a GraphRAG book that I've found very helpful: https://neo4j.com/essential-graphrag/ It depends on the shape of your data. In my domain (cloud security), there are many many entities and it's very valuable to map out how they relate to each other. For example, we often want to answer a question like: “Which publicly exposed EC2 instances are used by IAM roles that have administrative privileges in my AWS account?” To answer the question, you need to:\n1. Join ec2 instances to security groups to IP rules to IP ranges to find network exposure paths to the open internet.\n2. Join the instances to their instance profiles, to their roles.\n3. Join the IAM roles to their role policies to determine which have admin policies.\n4. Chain all of those joins together, possibly with recursive queries if there are indirect relationships (e.g., role assumption chains). That’s a lot of joins, and the SQL query would get both heavy and hard to maintain. In graph this query looks something like match (i:EC2Instance)--(sg:EC2SecurityGroup)--(r:IPPermissionInbound{action:\"Allow\"})--(rng:IPRange{id:\"0.0.0.0/0\"})\nmatch (i)--(r:AWSRole)--(p:AWSPolicy)--(stmt:AWSPolicyStatement{effect:\"Allow\", resource:\"*\"})\nreturn i.id as instance_id, r.name as role_name To answer this question what internet open compute instances can act as admins in our environment, we needed to traverse multiple objects, but the shape of the answer is pretty simple: just a list of ids and names. Graph databases have quirks and add complexity of their own. If your domain isn't this edge heavy, you're probably better off with Postgres, but for our use-case it's been worth the trade-off imo. reply",

See https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-rag-pipeline/ for more details on the architecture of this AI product. The graph database works very well for this use case. If you are considering the use of a graph database for AI based search and you are not already familiar with graph database technology, then you should be advised that graph databases are not relational databases. If you cognitively model nodes = tables and edges = joins, then you will be in for some nasty surprises. You should consider some learning, and some unlearning, to do before proceeding with that choice. reply",

Maybe they knew something that the team didn't but couldn't articulate it. Maybe it would have been great. Alternately (and this seems to be a common tactic unfortunately), is they don't really know what they are doing but use the strategy of introducing a large / time consuming change and promise incredible things once the change is complete. The longer the change takes, the better in this situation as they can just chill while the change is taking place and polish resume for the next gig if it doesn't work out.

          "text": "1. LLMs excell at extracting facts from the context. Storing them as a subject-predicate-object relationships is \"natural\" for graph databases. Doing it right, so that this knowledge can be utilized more efficiently than any RAG, requires sophisticated context engineering, for example to avoid duplicates and keep consistent vocabulary for relationships, but it is totally achievable and the quality of automatically extracted knowledge can be almost spotless, especially if an LLM can also decide on generating parallel embeddings as a semantic search entry point for graph traversal. 2. Writing cypher queries is a job I would never like to have as a human. But LLMs love it, so that an agent can do an ad hoc data science for every single problem. Especially while being aware which criteria were used for graph construction. It is worth ditching things like MCP in favor of tool graph-like solutions. For this purpose I developed my own DSL which only LLM speaks in internally. The effects are mind-blowing. reply",

          "text": "Graph RAG is great, but misunderstood. As a human user, consider file-system navigation or code search. You navigate to a seed file, and then hop through the children and dependencies until you find what you're looking for. The value is in explicit and direct edges. Perfect search is hard. Landing in the right neighborhood is less so. (It's like golf if you think about it) Agentic systems loop through the following steps - (Plan -> Inquire -> Retrieve -> Observe -> Act -> Repeat). The agent interacts with your search-system during the inquire and retrieve phases. In these phrases, There are 2 semantic problems that a simple embedding based search or a simple db alone can't solve: seeding and completeness. Seeding - How do you ask a good question when you don't know what you don't know ? Completeness -  once you know a little bit, how do you know that you have obtained everything you need to answer a question ? A solid embedding based search allows under-defined free-form inquiry, and puts the user near the data they're looking for. From there, an explicit graph allows the agent to navigate through the edges until it hits gold or gives the agent enough signal to retry with better informed free-form inquiry. Together, they solve the seeding problem. Now, once you have found a few seed nodes to work off of, the agent can keep exploring the neighbors, until they become sufficiently irrelevant. At that threshold, the retrieval system can return the explored nodes with a measurable metric of confidence in completeness. This makes completeness a measure that you can optimize, helping solve the 2nd problem. You'll notice that there is no magic here. The quality of your search will depend on the quality of your edges, entities, exploration strategy and relevance detectors. This requires a ton of hand-engineering and subject specific domain knowledge, neither of which are systems bottlenecks. The data-store itself will do very little to help get you a better answer. Which brings me to your question, the datastore. The datastore only matters at sufficient scale. You CAN implement Graph RAG in a standard database. Get a column to track your edges, a column to track entities and some way to search over embeddings and you're good. You can get it done in an afternoon (until permissions become an issue, but I digress). We know that a spotlight style file-system search works just fine on 100k+ documents, while your mac's fan barely even turns on. If you're asking this question, then your company probably doesn't scale past that point. In fact, I'd argue that few companies will ever cross that threshold for agentic operations. At this scale, your postgres instance won't be the bottleneck. Comparing postgres to graph-rag-startups, the real value of using a native graph-RAG solution is their defaults. The companies know that their user's need is agentic semantic search, and the products come preloaded with defaults that give you embeddings, entities and graph-edges that aren't completely useless. From a practical standpoint, those extras might push you over the edge. But be aware that your performance gains are coming from outsourcing the hand-engineering of features and not the data structure itself. My personal opinion is to keep the data structure as simple as possible. MLEs and Data Scientists are mediocre systems engineers and it is okay to accept that. You want your ML & product team to be able to iterate on the search-logic and quality as fast as possible. That's where the real gains will come from. Speaking from experience, premature optimization in a new field will slow your team down to a crawl. IE. Go with postgres if that's what's simple for everyone to work with. tldr: It's not about the scalability of the datastructure, it's about how you use it. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

Over the years I experimented a bit with leaflet.js and thought of overlaying maps too so you can navigate maps through time, but quickly realized it was super difficult. Kudos for setting this up! If you want to expand to other regions, or chat, or get access to high-res scans, let me know. I think plenty of old maps sellers would love to sell their maps this way. reply",

It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "That is so neat. I built something a little bit like this for a simulator of a 3D portal mill. Trying it on real wood got expensive fast so for debugging runs and trials of designs I would run a simulation where the toolbit would hack out the shape out of a three dimensional array of voxels. This was then displayed using a very simple engine built with PyGame. I got a lot of use out of that and it saved days (and a small forest). Great to see something along those lines but with much better visuals. reply",

Email: bepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I'm a software developer with lots of experience in full stack and backend development. I was most recently a developer at SirusXM Radio until I was laid off recently. The languages I've used the most are Python, Java, C++, Ruby ( Ruby on Rails ), and JavaScript. I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it! reply",

I am looking for my break to get into the contemporary software development scene, after having previously developed software (primarily Windows utilities) on my own and having dabbled in various technologies.  This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team.  An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development.  It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip - Community engagement platform for soccer fans. Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking. On the service-side, I’ve worked with traditional service hosting, containers, and serverless, including (but not limited to) AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Workers, CloudFormation, SAM CLI, nodejs, bunjs, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, grpc, Redis, Docker, nginx, and a few legacy tools best left unnamed (yes, including CodeIgniter and ftp). I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

While my core competency is frontend and the React ecosystem, I can navigate the full stack confidently and contribute to most any codebase.  I've worked on products sitting atop PHP, C#/.NET, Python, Rails and Node. The bulk of my experience is in startups (B2C, B2B & SaaS), though I am open to any organization that provides a strong culture fit.  In my experience, culture and team dynamics far outways what is being built - or the tech that is being used.  I am growth oriented and passionate about working collaboratively, cross-functionally, and making a meaningful impact in people's lives with what is built. I'm also unafraid of legacy code or tech debt. Note: My current role and location is in St Thomas, USVI.  After my last startup role, my family and I decided to try something new and see if life in the Virgin Islands could work for us.  In short, it did not.  My family is already in WA, and I am here finishing up my role as IT Coordinator.  I will be joining my family in WA at the end of November. reply",

That inspiring startup will take new sources of funding and chase new customers and leave you behind, on its own trajectory of eventual oblivion. When I frame things this way, I conclude that it's not that \"software quality\" is collapsing, but the quality of specific programs and companies. Success breeds failure. Apple is almost 50 years old. Seems fair to stipulate that some entropy has entered it. Pressure is increasing for some creative destruction. Whose job is it to figure out what should replace your Apple Calculator or Spotify? I'll put it to you that it's your job, along with everyone else's. If a program doesn't work, go find a better program. Create one. Share what works better. Vote with your attention and your dollars and your actual votes for more accountability for big companies.

The more someone is paying for something, the more bloodsucking mercenaries are attracted to it that have less consideration for the quality of the output than for their own enrichment.

Engineers who spend any time polishing or finding and fixing bugs wind up rated mid, while folks who quickly crank out mediocre or bad code that does something new are on a fast track for promotion. This creates a current in the whole org where PMs, engineers, managers, etc., are all focused on new things all the time. Any quality work has to accompany a new feature proposal for traction, and the quality items in that project will never get cross functional support like the new feature work does. This resource allocation strategy seems rational though. We could consume all available resources endlessly polishing things and never get anything new shipped. Honestly it seems like the another typical example of the “cost center” vs “revenue center” problem. How much should we spend on quality? It’s hard to tell up front. You don’t want to spend any more than the minimum to prevent whatever negative outcomes you think poor quality can cause.

Forms of revenue include: donations, selling support, selling licenses that are less restrictive than the original open source license, ads, and selling addons. Yes, revenue for open source software is generally less than for-profit software, and despite that the open source software is often higher quality.

          "text": "> I would prefer to pay 20% more That's the problem with lemon markets though. They are a feedback loop and usually dependent on asymmetric information. As a simple version think about it this way: if a customer can't tell the difference in quality at time of purchase then the only signal they have is price. I think even here on HN if we're being honest with ourselves it's hard to tell quality prior to purchase. Let alone the average nontechnical person. It's crazy hard to evaluate software even hands on. How much effort you need you put in these days. The difficulty of differentiating sponsored \"reviews\" from legitimate ones. Even all the fake reviews or how Amazon allows changing a product and inheriting the reviews of the old product. No one asks you because all the sellers rely too heavily on their metrics. It's not just AI people treat like black boxes, it's algorithms and metrics in general. But you can't use any of that effectively without context. At engineers I think we should be a bit more grumpy. Our job is to find problems and fix them. Be grumpy to find them. Don't let the little things slip because even though a papercut isn't a big deal, a thousand is. Go in and fix bugs without being asked to. Push back against managers who don't understand. You're the technical expert, not them (even if they were once an engineer, those skills atrophy and you get disconnected from a system when you aren't actively working on it). Don't let them make you make arguments about some made up monetary value for a feature or a fix. It's managements job to worry about money and our job to worry about the product. There needs to be a healthy adversarial process here. When push comes to shove, we should prioritize the product over the profit while they should do the opposite. This contention is a feature, not a bug. Because if we always prioritize profits, well, that's a race to the bottom. It kills innovation. It asks \"what's the shittiest cheapest thing we can sell but people will still buy\". It enables selling hype rather than selling products. So please, be a grumpy engineer. It's in the best interest of the company. Maybe not for the quarter, but it is for the year and the decade. (You don't need to be an asshole or even fight with your boss. Simply raising concerns about foreseeable bugs can be a great place to start. Filling bug reports for errors you find too! Or bugs your friends and family find. Or even help draft them with people like on HN that raise concerns about a product your company works on. Doesn't need to be your specific team, but file the bug report for someone who can't) And as the techies, we should hold high standards. Others rely on us for recommendations. We need to distill the nuances and communicate better with our nontechnical friends and family. These won't solve everything but I believe they are actionable, do not require large asks, and can push some progress. Better something than nothing, otherwise there will be no quality boots to buy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory reply",

All of the above is multiplied 1.3x-1.5x with accelerating ways to get upto speed with iterative indexing of knowledge with llms. I believe we are reliant on those early engineers whose software took a while to build (like a marathon), and not short-sprinted recyclable software we keep shipping on it.

The lure of a well paid career tempts many to the world of software engineering even if they're not very good at it. Look at the construction industry.  Many buildings on this planet were built hundreds, sometimes a thousand or more years ago.  They still stand today as the quality of their build quality was excellent. A house built today of cheap materials (i.e poor quality software engineers) as quickly as possible (i.e urgent business timelines) will fall apart in 30 years while older properties will continue to stand tall long after the \"modern\" house has crumbled. These days software is often about being first to market with quality (and cough security) being a distant second priority. However occasionally software does emerge as high quality and becomes a foundation for further software.  Take Linux, FreeBSD and curl as examples of this.  Their quality control is very high priority and time has proven this to be beneficial - for every user. reply",

The Pareto principle suggests that addressing only the most critical 20% of issues issues yields a disproportionate 80% of the benefits, while the rest of the big bounties yield diminishing marginal returns. We're seeing bugs in bigger slices because technology is, overall, a bigger pie. Full of bugs. The bigger the pie, the easier it is to eat around them. Another principle at play might be \"induced demand,\" most notoriously illustrated by widening highways, but might just as well apply to the widening of RAM. Are we profligate consumers of our rareified, finite computing substrate? Perhaps, but the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem suggests that anything less than 50% waste heat would slow us down. What's the rush? That's above my pay grade. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see any sort of moral, procedural, or ideological decay at fault.

Also, in my own job, it's often tempting to use LLMs where I really shouldn't, by which I mean where I can't easily check the code to ensure that it's fully and subtly correct. For example, if I'm working with an unfamiliar library I might ask an LLM what the incantation is to do something, and then check it by reading the docs of each thing that it references. I regularly find issues when doing so, but a different developer who didn't check these docs may miss this and ship a subtle bug. reply",

It's not the case in traditional engineering fields: when you build a dam, the manager cannot say \"hmm just use half as much concrete here, it will be faster and nobody will realise\". Because people can go to jail for that. The engineers know that they need to make it safe, and the managers know that if the engineers say \"it has to be like that for safety\", then the manager just accepts it. In software it's different: nobody is responsible for bad software. Millions of people need to buy a new smartphone because software needs twice as much RAM for no reason? Who cares? So the engineers will be pushed to make what is more profitable: often that's bad software, because users don't have a clue either. Normal people understand the risks if we talk about a bridge or a dam collapsing. But privacy, security, efficiency, not having to buy a new smartphone every 2 years to load Slack? They have no clue about that. They just want to use what the others use, and they don't want to pay for software. And when it's not that, it's downright enshittification: users don't have a choice anymore. reply",

They get customers, then funding, then \"we'll refactor later\" becomes \"we can't afford downtime to refactor.\" That's how you end up with production systems built on prototypes that were never meant to handle real load. I'm with you: if you're not willing to build it properly, don't build it at all. Technical debt compounds faster than most founders realize.

Apple's revenue, for instance, would make them the 40th largest country in the world by GDP - larger than Portugal, Hungary, Greece, and the overwhelming majority of countries in existence. And it seems to be essentially a rule that as companies reach a certain threshold of size, the quality of what they produce begins to trend downward until they're eventually replaced by an upstart who then starts their trek towards reaching the threshold of fail. But in modern political and economic times where number must always go up, too big to fail is a thing and anti-trust enforcement isn't (to say nothing of the FTC mostly just ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ with regards to basically any merger/acquisition of big tech), the current batch of companies just keeps growing and growing instead of being naturally replaced. To say nothing of the fact that a lot of startup culture now sees being acquired as the endgame, rather than even dreaming of competing against these monstrosities. reply",

I feel that software has become vastly more complex, which increases what I call \"trouble nodes.\" These are places where a branch, API junction, abstraction, etc., give space for bugs. The vast complexity means that software does a lot more, but it also means that it is chock-full of trouble nodes, and that it needs to be tested a lot more rigorously than in the past. Another huge problem is dependence on dependencies. Abstracting trouble nodes does not make them go away. It simply puts them into an area that we can't test properly and fix. reply",

For instance, Steve Jobs Apple era is much more focused on quality and attention to detail. Under Tim Cook, Apple shifted from “it just works” to “ship fast, fix in updates.” The difference isn’t complexity it’s priorities. Jobs-era Apple had smaller teams building fewer products with obsessive quality standards. Cook-era Apple has massive teams shipping constantly with “good enough” as the bar. You’re right that testing helps. But when quality becomes optional, no amount of testing infrastructure fixes the cultural problem. We test for “does it work?” not “is it excellent?” These issues passed all automated tests. They just didn’t pass the “would we be embarrassed to ship this?” test.

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want. We're getting big enough to start splitting into more focused teams and there's a few different areas that we need; our infra needs a lot of work, we have big dreams for some cool AI agent/pipeline work and there's still a lot of more fundamental phone system specific problems we need to solve. We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can! You'll need to visit our London office roughly once a month. Email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring? reply",

          "text": "1. All the changes in AI from the past couple of years have only increased demand for MLEs. The job profile kind of widened too, - MLE has always been a subset of SWE but even more so if you're working with LLMs. So some MLE jobs will still require a lot of theory, some won't, but they all require some understanding of AI/ML. You kind of need to know what you want to work on instead of targeting specific job titles (which can be hard to navigate if you're early in your career and have no experience). 2. Overall market dynamics still apply - the increase from 1. is relative to the market i.e. if the market has been tough for other roles like frontend for example, it has been less tough for MLEs because they work on the thing that's exciting at the moment. 3. Should new grads focus on it? New grads will likely have a difficult time regardless of what they decide to do - maybe in a couple of years there won't be excitement around AI/ML, maybe there will be more, maybe something else will be hot. The overall market almost certainly be different, and that could be for the better or worse. Hard to predict the future. Whatever you decide to do early in your career, know that you're not married to it forever. Develop general skills that can be applied in many areas. reply",

I hear from recruiters occasionally but mostly just dubious startups.  The companies I interact with (mid-sized non-tech) are reluctant to hire anyone for any reason, even though management is full of ideas for new AI products. I don't think I can offer advice on whether new grads should focus on it or not.

          "text": "My understanding is the big difference is REST must have URLs returned in the API responses to access additional data / actions. So in a REST API you'd have a single URL entrypoint that I'll call \"/root\". \"/root\" might then return to you something like: {\n    \"links\": {\n      \"users\": \"/root/users\",\n      \"posts\": \"/root/posts\",\n      \"mail\": \"/root/mail\"\n    }\n  } So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users\" which would return a list of users along with URLs for how to access individual users. So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users/alice\" and the server would return the information on alice along with URLs for actions like sending her a message or deleting her. But all of that interaction is driven from information returned from the server. All the client needed to begin was just the root URL. Most non-REST JSON APIs today communicate their endpoints via an out-of-band API documentation like swagger. Quoting the Fielding: > A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs > [...] > A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypert... reply",

          "text": "One of the big things too is the encoding of type information using the mechanisms the standard interfaces provide. In HTTP, this is accomplished using media types (through the Accept and Content-Type headers as well as a few related ones). These media types can be standard but they can be vendored too[1]. With something like Content-Type: application/json\n\n   {\n       \"name\": \"\",\n       ...\n   } you don't really know much. With something like example/vnd.mycoolapp.user+json, you get typing information (i.e. you know that the representation of /users/me that the server has given you is a JSON variant of a mycoolapp User. (How the types are known is a priori knowledge of the client (but there are standard link relations you can use to reference API documentation, both human-readable and machine-readable)). A good example of this is your web browser: it knows how to display text/html documents of various character sets, probably knows text/plain, might know application/json. The best part is? HTTP has a standard mechanism for defining these link relations even if what you have isn't necessarily amenable to link relations[2] (the Link header). You can use that to navigate through a collection (previous, item, collection, etc), get documentation about the API (service-doc, service-desc), find things that are related (related), get STUN and TURN information (ice-server), etc. I doubt very much of this is used in practice, but there are a very rich set of standardized relationships that could be used here. (A lot of people admittedly assume \"using PUT in a couple of places\" is doing REST or that not calling all of your method endpoints doAction.pl or whatever is \"RESTful\" and I think that definition has become so widespread that talking about something that approaches actually doing something that resembles the architectural style tends to require reduplication.)

          "text": "I can't say I've seen that many examples of APIs that use them richly. You see a little bit of in in specs that require something be done a certain way (WHEP in particular requires you send ICE information in ice-server link relations). Part of it probably stems from the fact that a lot of the tooling was built on top of OpenAPI (which had discriminators built in and so people used that for implementing \"sum types\"), etc, and part of that comes from the fact that a lot of HTTP-based APIs basically only take the content portion of the response, ignoring the headers basically entirely (outside of maybe redirects). Relatively speaking I think there aren't that many people that know that it is even really a possibility, let alone use it. (You even see discussions on even whether the status codes are to be used at all, when they were really purpose-built to be generalizable.) This partially is self-reinforcing: the server libraries don't do anything with media types generally outside of maybe a \"FileResponse\"-ish class or function and the client libraries don't tend to implement it because it's not supported. Part of it too may be that interoperability isn't necessarily an underlying goal. > one other thought, I'm starting to see how the semantic web fits into this vision.

          "text": "SOAP was actually pretty easy to use, once it settled out. For the most part, everyone used some kind of SDK that translated WSDL (Web Services Description Language) specifications to their chosen language. So you could define almost any function - like PostBlog(Blog blog), and then publish it as a WSDL interface to be consumed by a client. We could have a Java server, with a C# client, and it more or less just worked. We used it with things like signatures, so the data in the message wasn't tampered with. Why did it stop getting popular? It probably really started to fall out of favor when Java/C# stopped being some of the more popular programming languages for web development, and PHP and Ruby got a lot more momentum. The idea was that REST/JSON interfaces would be easier to understand, as we would have a hypermedia interface. There was sort of an attempt to make a RESTy interface work with XML, called WebDAV, that Microsoft Office supported for a while, but it was pretty hard to work with.

          "text": "SOAP achieved functional obsolescence. If you go back before 2005 JSON did not exist and nobody except a Microsoft webmail client were making dynamic HTTP calls. XML was young and growing wildly out of control. XML had two problems. Most obviously it is verbose, but people didn’t care because XML was really smart. Amazingly smart. The second problem is that XML technologies were too smart. Most developers aren’t that smart and had absolutely no imagination necessary to implement any of this amazing smartness. JSON kind of, but not really, killed XML. It’s like how people believe Netflix killed Blockbuster. Blockbuster died because of financial failures due to too rapid late stage expansion and format conversion. Netflix would have killed Blockbuster later had Blockbuster not killed itself first. JSON and XML are kind of like that. JSON allowed for nested data structures but JSON tried to be smart. To the contrary JSON tried to be as dumb as possible, not as dumb as CSV, but pretty close. What amazes me in all of this is that people are still using HTTP for so much data interchange like it’s still the late 90s. Yeah, I understand it’s ubiquitous and sessionless but after that it’s all downhill and extremely fragile for any kind of wholesale large data replication or it costs too much at the thread level for massively parallel operations. reply",

          "text": "One thing I would mention is that COM and CORBA have explicit support for object references, which is a concept that disappeared from later protocols. With these technologies, a server can return a reference to, say, a Person. The client can then do \"person.GetName()\" or similar. The method calls are implemented as \"stubs\" that act as proxies that simply send the RPC along with the references to the objects they operate on. The server-side RPC implementation keeps a mapping between references and actual in-memory objects, so that calls to references call the right thing in the server process. The benefit is that you can work with APIs in ways that feel natural. You can do \"persons.GetPerson(\"123\").GetEmployer().GetEmployees()\" or whatever — everything feels like you're working with in-memory objects. This has drawbacks. One is that the cost of method calls is obscured by this \"referential transparency\", as it's never obvious what is remote or local. Another problem is that the server is required to keep an object around until a client releases it or dies. If the client dies without first releasing, the objects will live until a keepalive timer triggers. But because a malformed client can keep objects around, the system is vulnerable to high memory use (and abuse). In the end you'd often end up holding a whole graph of objects, and nothing would be released until all references were released. Leak can be difficult to find. My knowledge of COM/CORBA may be incomplete, but never understood why the server couldn't implement these in terms of \"locators\". For example, if a server has a \"GetPerson(string id) -> Person\" type method, rather than sending an object reference that points to an in-memory person object, it could return a lightweight, opaque string like \"person:123\". Any time the client's internal proxy passed this back to the server, the server could look it up; the glue needed to resolve these identifiers back into real objects would be a little more work on the part of the developer, but it would sidestep the whole need to keep objects around. And they could cached quite easily. Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. However, it does this in a pretty different way with different pros and cons. [1] https://blog.cloudflare.com/capnweb-javascript-rpc-library/ reply",

          "text": "> Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. Cap'n Proto does it too, and has been around since 2013. We use it extensively it the implementation of Cloudflare Workers. Many people have joined the team, initially thought \"what is this weird thing? Why don't we just use gRPC instead?\", and then after a few months of using it decided it's actually a superpower. I'm planning to write more about this on the Cloudflare blog in the next couple months, probably. (Cap'n Proto is itself based on CapTP, the protocol used in the E programming language.) I never actually used COM nor CORBA, but my impression is there's a few reasons they didn't work where Cap'n Proto does: 1. Excessive complexity. CORBA is a monstrously large standard, covering not just protocol but also system architecture (\"Object Resource Brokers\"). 2. Lack of asynchronous programming. CORBA calls would synchronously block the calling thread until the call completed. But when making calls over a network (rather than locally), it's much more important that you be able to do other things while you wait. CORBA added (extremely complex) asynchronous I/O support late in its life but few people ever used it. 3. Lack of promise pipelining. This sort of follows from #2 (at least, I don't know how you'd express promise pipelining if you don't have promises to start with). Without promise pipelining, it's incredibly hard to design composable interfaces, because they cannot be composed without adding a round trip for every call. So instead you end up pushed towards big batch requests, but those don't play well with object-oriented API design. 4. Poor lifecycle management. An object reference in CORBA was (I am told) \"just data\", which could be copied anywhere and then used. The server had no real way of being notified when the object reference was no longer needed, unless clients proactively told it so (but this was up to the app). Cap'n Proto ties object lifetime to connections, so when a connection is lost, all the object references held across it are automatically disposed. Cap'n Proto's client libraries are also designed to carefully track the lifecycle of a reference within the client app, so that as soon as it goes out-of-scope (GC'd, destructor runs, etc.), a message can be sent to the server letting it know. This works pretty well. 5. Bad security model. All objects existed in a global namespace and any client could connect to any object. Access control lists had to be maintained to decide which clients were allowed access to which objects. This is a bolted-on security mechanism that sounds simple but in practice is extremely tedious and error-prone, and often people would avoid it by implementing coarse-grained security models. Cap'n Proto implements an object-capability model, aka capability-based security. There is no global namespace of objects. To access one, you have to first receive an object reference from someone who already has one. Passing someone an object reference implies giving them permission to use it. This may at first sound more complicated, but in practice it turns out to map very cleanly to common object-oriented API design patterns. As a result of all this, in Cap'n Proto (and Cap'n Web), you can pretty much use the exact same API design patterns you'd use in a modern programming language, with lots of composable objects and methods, and it's all safe and efficient.

          "text": "I'm one of the thankfully few people in the world who worked on an implementation of DCOM (in my case, for Wine, although by coincidence I had a university lecturer who did the same for QNX). They're very similar systems. I think some of that is true and mattered, some of it is true and didn't matter much, and there's some aspects missing. Neither DCOM nor CORBA worked well over the internet. DCOM was designed in an era when Bill Gates was publicly shitting on the internet and saying the future was closed BBS networks like CompuServe, AOL and MSN. Microsoft didn't have a reasonable internet strategy back then, even TCP/IP support was kinda ropey. So DCOM assumed an entirely flat network in which every machine had a unique network address,  was up all the time, there were no firewalls anywhere and encryption wasn't needed. As a consequence passing a callback to an object - a very OOP and idiomatic thing to do - meant the server would try to connect back to the client. Every RPC system back then made this mistake, also in the UNIX world with Java's RPC system (RMI), Sun RPC etc. Thus every client in these architectures was also a server. This idea was just about tenable up until the DSL rollout and teenagers started noticing that every Windows XP box on the internet was also a server with a bunch of exposed RPC interfaces, all of which was connected to piles of crappy old C++ riddled with memory safety bugs. After a few megaworms Microsoft pushed updates that added a firewall and closed the entire RPC port by default, instead of providing any kind of finer grained support for firewalling at the object exporter level, and that was the end of any chance of using this 90s generation of RPC. HTTP, on the other hand, had a very clear notion of what was a server and what was a client. It also had SSL/TLS, developed by Netscape for the web, which was one of the first cryptographic protocols. We take it for granted now but stuff like DCOM had no equivalent and no effort to develop any. After all, objects are exported over wired ethernet ports at your office, right? Why would you need any encryption? The need for it on the web was driven by eCommerce but nobdy used DCOM or CORBA for exporting shops over the network. Systems like DCOM did have object capabilities and lifecycle handling, but that wasn't terribly useful because the default timeout on pings was absurdly high, like 20 minutes or something, and so in practice the ability to hold references to stateful objects could cause memory leaks accidentally and of course the moment anyone wanted to DoS attack you it was all over. reply",

Since these were early days of the web, there were no openidconnect, no jwt, no encryption standards.

A decade of legitimate participation and community contribution was wiped out instantly with no recourse.<p>Has anyone experienced similar incidents? What are the options when legitimate account recovery appeals are automatically denied despite evidence of compromise?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Also every 1-2 years I would delete my account(s), and start brand-new with new accounts (to avoid doxxing). 2. I had 3 alt accounts, one for professional reasons (AI, coding, etc), one for local interests (NYC), and one for fun/shitposting. All three linked to the same email address. 3. I did not violate any rules (except for running a script), I did not upvoted/downvoted each other's posts or upvoted/downvoted the same post from different accounts, each accounts followed different subs. IMO Reddit is cleaning up house and surely didn't like my deleting my history. C'est la vie! reply",

The bad publicity got the attention of top executives, who pressured the accounts team to resolve the situation. - One user actually just made contact with a well-placed executive and explained the situation.  (In your case, that might even be a moderator.) Also, you're not the only person I've heard who's had trouble with Reddit's account policy.  If you could find others like yourself, it'd be a more interesting story for the media, or more likely to get an executive's attention. I wondered if it could be an \"inside job\".  (Someone disabling 2FA just long enough to log in?)   Reddit ticked off its moderators earlier this month, though I'm not sure they'd have have the power to do this. reply",

I’ve tried just letting tables scroll horizontally but it feels clunky. I’ve seen some apps convert tables to card-style layouts, others use expandable rows, and some just hide columns.\nWhat patterns have you found actually work well in production? Any libraries or examples you’d recommend checking out? Bonus points if you’ve done user testing on this and have data on what users actually prefer.</div>",

E.g. short or hidden id, short but readable name, useful next column (e.g. sales or views or whatever is the most useful data). 2. Put columns that need to be evaluated together close to each other. On desktop it's easy to see 2 numbers even if there's a column in the middle, on mobile it may require scrolling horizontally. In summary, just focus on what people want to see at a glance and make it easier for them. I'm just a user suffering the pain, this is an example of a table I need/want to monitor and it's very poorly done, I need total revenue = sum of column 5 + 7, on mobile it's a very bad experience due to column 6 in the middle, unnecessary width of some columns with repeated text, etc. https://app.vx.tools/income/BfgMdL4FaNHp5zZpD7WMYG5sZUrCWQPE... reply",

There is something about Rails' convention over configuration that plays really well with LLMs, and I love not having to fiddle with _too_ much javascript (it's still tbd whether hotwire and stimulus is actually better than react from my POV). I've recently started also exploring Hotwire Native to get mobile apps launched and so far have been really impressed that it \"mostly just works\". If I'm successful, I'm sure I will get to a scale where I'm wishing for static typing, but so far I've been able to accomplish way more with Rails in the same amount of time than I have in any other stack. To answer your question, I'm very open to paying for features that I think will save me time (such as JumpStart). From what I've read, however, I think that's a hard road to go down to be frank.

Recovering my GitHub has proven to be more painful than Google's treatment regarding my Google Workspace.<p>I have the original phone number associated with my account, and can verify a bunch of private repos that are associated with my account—even the number of commits on one of them (almost 6900). I can't, however, provide any 2FA codes or backup codes because they are printed on paper that has, I assume, been destroyed.<p>I maintain two relatively popular Ruby packages that have gone stale since I've been gone, and there are projects my GitHub there that I was working on prior to my incarceration—including a SaaS I had hoped to launch post-prison and two books I was ready to publish. Having said, just opening another account isn't exactly the option I want to take.<p>I've opened a ticket, but I'm getting the \"shit out of luck because we don't know you are you\" treatment. I understand that security is important, but if one can prove they are them, what's the point?<p>Are there other avenues I have that I haven't explored yet?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I would be very perturbed to find out that GitHub would grant access to my account given identity documents.

Like my data center (not US based) has a process where if you lose all of the documentation proving that a server is yours, you can go on site physically with ID, and the police and/or national identity service will verify on the spot that your finger prints match what is on file for the ID.

Scuff marks and specific document numbers included. I think that probably even scales. If I lose access to my main identity document, one advantage of government ID is that I’ll urgently have it reissued. In most of the places I’ve lived, that’s the kind of thing you can validate against either the underlying authority or a sleazy-but-reasonably-accurate data broker. But in either case it’s out-of-band from my relationship with the tech company, in a way they can validate by semi- or fully-automated means, and with reference to an independent authority.

          "text": "I’m not sure that blaming tech support for not understanding context is the best approach here. The other sides of that context, which are  understandable from their point of view, is that you were charged with some serious crimes. There’s a large delta between the charges and the conviction, but you’ve got some scary words written about you online. Secondarily, GitHub has policy so whereas you’re coming at it from a position of being correct, they’re in a position where they have to break policy. That’s a big risk. Your best bet would likely be legal. US Federal law imposes some strict rules on lawyers for identity verification to combat money laundering so attorneys have a legally recognized toolkit to verify identity. Having a third party who works for you in the mix could help. Though again, it would involve breaking their policy so this would be a decision made several layers above Zendesk access. Otherwise, I think this is doing precisely what 2FA is meant to do. It’s not okay for you and you’ve clearly lost a lot because of this, but with the current threat environment, GitHub has to be very careful especially with 2FA. From their point of view, there likely isn’t that big of a gap between your interactions and interactions with people who are trying to take over accounts. A lawyer may not work, but it sure changes that equation. reply",

I had set-up my business Slack workspace in college; 4 years after graduation my university changed policies (they used to forward name@edu => name@alumni.edu). I tried the normal means (support tickets etc) to no avail. The third or fourth time I got someone in account recovery. There was a very formal process for verifying my identity (I'm sure based on the process this happens all the time). Eventually I they helped me recover my account. It probably took a few months on the whole, but once I got the right support rep it was only a week or so. So my advice would be to submit more tickets. Because they might have a process that not all support agents know about, and some are more helpful than others. reply",

Lawyers or notarized ID may be needed...possibly expensive, but sometimes the only way GH support is extremely strict on account recovery once 2FA/backup codes are gone. I wish you luck! reply",

I'll replace my website as soon as this issue is solved.)

In your  reply to this, please acknowledge your receipt of my email, and if you can, print it out as well, as it can become inaccessible later. Of course, there are a lot of NSA-affiliated people who could come out of the woodworks to support parent's slander that I \"sound paranoid and schizophrenic\". The reason they don't? They're witnesses in the FBI case and don't want to go to prison themselves. The FBI has already handwritten over 10,000 affidavits in this case. (They are writing by hand to avoid electronic tampering with evidence.) I am not making a media story about it yet, which would be the next step, so there are no articles about this yet. My reason for not doing so is not to bring extra attention to the case, but simply to solve it in a straightforward and expedient manner. reply",

I even created detailed plans for easy to build features that users requested.<p><i>YET, every time I sit down in front of my computer, I freeze up.</i><p>I know exactly what to build and how to build it, but I spend two or three hours trying to maintain focus for more than 30 minutes in a row. (And, no, Pomodoro didn't work either.)<p>I feel like a spring that can't wait to jump somewhere else.<p>I've tried working on it after my day job and before work. I quit social media and try to spend my free time consuming long-form media to avoid ruining my attention span because I keep thinking that's the cause of my strife. But the result is the same: zero energy for execution.<p>Worse yet, I can't even enjoy my time away from it. The guilt of not being in front of my computer working on the project completely ruins my evenings, weekends, and social time. Stepping away feels impossible because the guilt makes relaxing more stressful than trying (and failing) to work.<p>How can I escape this cycle?<p>(And, yes, I wrote this while <i>trying</i> to do some work on the project.)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "A couple things that help me when I hit this exact wall: shrink the surface area and make the loop tiny. Pick one ridiculously small, end‑to‑end deliverable (e.g., “add X toggle with a minimal UI, ship a changelog”) and set a 15‑minute “opening ritual” where the only goal is to open the editor and write a stub or one failing test. Energy often follows action, not the other way around. If solo inertia is heavy, swap in co‑working or lightweight pairing; or open a small, well‑scoped issue to invite contributions so you’re reviewing instead of starting cold. Also worth reframing: is this a business or a craft project? If it’s not pulling its weight commercially, put it in maintenance mode with a clear cadence and let yourself step away guilt‑free for a month. Sunlight, movement, new inputs—your brain will reset its reward signals. When you come back, protect the fun: fewer plans, more shipping, tighter feedback loops. reply",

          "text": "Jennifer Senior wrote a great piece back in 2006 about burnout [1] titled \"Can’t Get No Satisfaction\". It's worth reading the whole thing. Here are some fragments that stuck with me: > we think of burnout as the gap between expectations and rewards > happiness equals reality divided by expectations > level of caring couldn’t be sustained in the absence of results How have you been framing your side project? Is your side project intended to be a business? If so, what outputs is the business achieving (revenue, profit, your effective hourly wage as the owner operator)?  Dispassionately, is it doing well enough commercially that it makes sense to continue to pursue this business? In the case where this side project has not been achieving sufficient commercial results, and has been falling short of your expectations and the goals you set yourself, is it possible that your resistance to continuing working on the side project is because subconsciously your body has decided it is not a good use of additional time and energy? It could be beneficial and healthy if you could give yourself a long break from thinking and focusing on your side project, to get your brain out of this habit of focusing on the side project and give it the opportunity to think and focus on some new things, or just to rest. From my experience (not with side projects but with job related burnout)  consider taking a holiday from it, get lots of sunlight and exercise, spend time with friends and family, pick up a new hobby or resume an old hobby that gives you some immediate enjoyment in the moment.  It may take months for your habitual thinking patterns to adjust, but once your thinking patterns change you may have a very different perspective on the situation.

It felt like writing Java while I was actually writing Python. There is also a big element of wanting a lot more control on how my agent works compared to what a framework could provide us (around context management, compacting histories if the chat gets too big etc). Having said that I am curious<p>1. Do you use frameworks, if so which one?<p>2. If you used a framework but churned, which one did you churn from and why?<p>3.

Main Street is not really any better at seeing through hype cycles than anyone else, but they are less up-to-date on what is currently hyped, and they also are more likely to think that they hired the programmer to make technical decisions, rather than wanting to make those technical decisions themselves.  They have other (often equally technical) decisions to concentrate on, in different areas, so they are wanting you to just Make It Work. The downside is they are unimpressed with refactoring, updating to new versions, and the like.  The upside is they are ok with you using boring technology that works, even at times when a VC-backed tech company would insist on something new and overcomplicated. Also, the pay is ok, but honestly it's not going to be as high as in VC-backed employers. reply",

Leaving corporate tech jobs is already a big enough hit to TC. Getting out of VC-funded tech very often means a dramatic change in life style. The VC world might be insane, but so is the comp. It's not just the money. The biggest thing I've notice in my career is that, as a general rule, employers value you (or any resource for that matter) in proportion to how much they pay for you. Often people have the illusion that getting paid $80k a year when you used to make $300k will mean that your employer will recognize that you are a tremendous value. They won't. they'll see you and treat you as a low tier worker that can easily be replaced, has timed breaks and 30 minutes for lunch. reply",

Sounds like the folk wisdom that, by default, employers/clients tend to only value you how much they're paying you. If they had to pay a lot extra for you, the wisdom goes, they will imagine that you must have been worth it, and will take you more seriously. If they paid bargain basement price for you, well, I suppose the same psychology applies. (I was reminded of this folk wisdom last week, by a couple hints in an interview.  It's a bit tricky to filter out startup employers who only want midrange commodity skillsets, when you're willing to take a lower salary in exchange for meaningful equity.  While many of them are thinking of workers as generic commodities (and necessary evils, to the real stars who are the founders), and valuing these hires based on salary they are willing to entertain.) reply",

Most of my other friends went to work at other startups. Most of them went bust and they made nothing but their base salary (and a couple of them got screwed on that too). So unless someone’s working at an actual unicorn like I was it’s really no guarantee. FWIW I made 8x on my latest shares, and multiples on that on earliest. Some people I know who had been there a few years more than me walked away with many more Ms which ain’t bad for 6-8 years of work. But that is SUPER lucky. It has sort of ruined my outlook too because I have no interest making 250k base + 200k RSUs, and I have zero interest in most of these current startups that I have a good hunch will not work out. And 400k isn’t that meaningful anymore, I’d rather live off interest or work as a barista if my own startup doesn’t work out. reply",

          "text": "How are you defining “B2C businesses on Main Street.” The reason I’m wondering is because it’s striking how much more financially challenged my Main Street is compared to Vc texh. I see so much opportunity for a small medium business consultation in the analytics and process space but these companies are like really strapped for money and largely set in their ways in my experience. In my experience, people are open to solving their problems. It’s just the money is hard making it financially viable so it’s just the big money is just like an order of magnitude smaller. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I think the general level of sort of like process thinking and data driven decision making in tech is at just like a higher baseline than on Main Street A lot of my discussions are challenging how to sort of like present the problem in a way that somebody that doesn’t have decades of experience and operations understands. Another challenge that I face regularly with Main Street companies is just people seem to be happy like they’re not trying to continuously optimize like I’m used to doing coming for a big tech. Even when it’s easy to present like positive ROI opportunities there’s just like a comfort with the way things are done and a lot of people seem just happy governed by their scaling factors in exchange for that that comfort. TLDR; challenges are financial and mentality. reply",

Normally too early for VC, and often very shiny thing, or polishing things expected to be shiny in the future. I've only once worked on main street when I was managing the app for a pizza chain. One day, sitting in a quarterly planning meeting for the pizza company, they were discussing changes they could make to the app and the comment that stood out in my head was \"we forecast this change could help us sell x% more garlic bread\". In my head I thought, \"I don't care how much garlic bread we sell...this is not why I'm on the planet\". I know not every mains st. business is selling pizza, and lots of B2B companies, VC backed or not, would not excite me. You're right, helping investors make money isn't very compelling, and I think B2B, has that kind of focus, but many ventures aren't B2B SaaS. There is lots going on in health, energy, space, etc. right now.  I do expect many of these bubbles will pop, but is there something there that interests you?

Since they couldn't change it without risking breaking a customer they were migrating one customer at a time to a classic RDBMS. (There were like 200 customers, each of which is a company you've probably heard of). Many will go \"you need a proper ontology\" at which point just use a RDBMS. Ontologies are an absolute tarpit, as the semantic web showed. The graph illusion is similar to that academic delusion \"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.\" which is one of those quips that makes you appreciate just how theoretical some theoreticians really are. reply",

Most of the time all I need is just a csv-like structure of the data I'm working with and I had a very difficult time with just getting something like that. Joining tables tended to be difficult where the pivot points between relationships was rather semantically unbounded, so it was difficult for me to create a reasonably rigid mental model of the data I was working with. That was especially noticeable in some of the API documentation I worked with -- where a simple REST-like API just gives a simple, usually flat, json... graphql api responses were deeply nested and often in implementation-dependent ways[1] of thousands of lines. Which has IME made explorability practically impossible. GraphQL implementations have consistently felt like a hobby project where implementing it in an API becomes a thing to put on a resume rather than making a functionally useful API.

          "text": "Neo4j has a GraphRAG book that I've found very helpful: https://neo4j.com/essential-graphrag/ It depends on the shape of your data. In my domain (cloud security), there are many many entities and it's very valuable to map out how they relate to each other. For example, we often want to answer a question like: “Which publicly exposed EC2 instances are used by IAM roles that have administrative privileges in my AWS account?” To answer the question, you need to:\n1. Join ec2 instances to security groups to IP rules to IP ranges to find network exposure paths to the open internet.\n2. Join the instances to their instance profiles, to their roles.\n3. Join the IAM roles to their role policies to determine which have admin policies.\n4. Chain all of those joins together, possibly with recursive queries if there are indirect relationships (e.g., role assumption chains). That’s a lot of joins, and the SQL query would get both heavy and hard to maintain. In graph this query looks something like match (i:EC2Instance)--(sg:EC2SecurityGroup)--(r:IPPermissionInbound{action:\"Allow\"})--(rng:IPRange{id:\"0.0.0.0/0\"})\nmatch (i)--(r:AWSRole)--(p:AWSPolicy)--(stmt:AWSPolicyStatement{effect:\"Allow\", resource:\"*\"})\nreturn i.id as instance_id, r.name as role_name To answer this question what internet open compute instances can act as admins in our environment, we needed to traverse multiple objects, but the shape of the answer is pretty simple: just a list of ids and names. Graph databases have quirks and add complexity of their own. If your domain isn't this edge heavy, you're probably better off with Postgres, but for our use-case it's been worth the trade-off imo. reply",

Maybe they knew something that the team didn't but couldn't articulate it. Maybe it would have been great. Alternately (and this seems to be a common tactic unfortunately), is they don't really know what they are doing but use the strategy of introducing a large / time consuming change and promise incredible things once the change is complete. The longer the change takes, the better in this situation as they can just chill while the change is taking place and polish resume for the next gig if it doesn't work out. If they jump to a new job before failure is obvious they can claim that they affected some large change at previous company and repeat the process. The other strategy is to performtatively claim success in the face of failure and move on to the next big thing. reply",

Writing cypher queries is a job I would never like to have as a human. But LLMs love it, so that an agent can do an ad hoc data science for every single problem. Especially while being aware which criteria were used for graph construction. It is worth ditching things like MCP in favor of tool graph-like solutions.

          "text": "Graph RAG is great, but misunderstood. As a human user, consider file-system navigation or code search. You navigate to a seed file, and then hop through the children and dependencies until you find what you're looking for. The value is in explicit and direct edges. Perfect search is hard. Landing in the right neighborhood is less so. (It's like golf if you think about it) Agentic systems loop through the following steps - (Plan -> Inquire -> Retrieve -> Observe -> Act -> Repeat). The agent interacts with your search-system during the inquire and retrieve phases. In these phrases, There are 2 semantic problems that a simple embedding based search or a simple db alone can't solve: seeding and completeness. Seeding - How do you ask a good question when you don't know what you don't know ? Completeness -  once you know a little bit, how do you know that you have obtained everything you need to answer a question ? A solid embedding based search allows under-defined free-form inquiry, and puts the user near the data they're looking for. From there, an explicit graph allows the agent to navigate through the edges until it hits gold or gives the agent enough signal to retry with better informed free-form inquiry. Together, they solve the seeding problem. Now, once you have found a few seed nodes to work off of, the agent can keep exploring the neighbors, until they become sufficiently irrelevant. At that threshold, the retrieval system can return the explored nodes with a measurable metric of confidence in completeness. This makes completeness a measure that you can optimize, helping solve the 2nd problem. You'll notice that there is no magic here. The quality of your search will depend on the quality of your edges, entities, exploration strategy and relevance detectors. This requires a ton of hand-engineering and subject specific domain knowledge, neither of which are systems bottlenecks. The data-store itself will do very little to help get you a better answer. Which brings me to your question, the datastore. The datastore only matters at sufficient scale. You CAN implement Graph RAG in a standard database. Get a column to track your edges, a column to track entities and some way to search over embeddings and you're good. You can get it done in an afternoon (until permissions become an issue, but I digress). We know that a spotlight style file-system search works just fine on 100k+ documents, while your mac's fan barely even turns on. If you're asking this question, then your company probably doesn't scale past that point. In fact, I'd argue that few companies will ever cross that threshold for agentic operations. At this scale, your postgres instance won't be the bottleneck. Comparing postgres to graph-rag-startups, the real value of using a native graph-RAG solution is their defaults. The companies know that their user's need is agentic semantic search, and the products come preloaded with defaults that give you embeddings, entities and graph-edges that aren't completely useless. From a practical standpoint, those extras might push you over the edge. But be aware that your performance gains are coming from outsourcing the hand-engineering of features and not the data structure itself. My personal opinion is to keep the data structure as simple as possible. MLEs and Data Scientists are mediocre systems engineers and it is okay to accept that. You want your ML & product team to be able to iterate on the search-logic and quality as fast as possible. That's where the real gains will come from. Speaking from experience, premature optimization in a new field will slow your team down to a crawl. IE. Go with postgres if that's what's simple for everyone to work with. tldr: It's not about the scalability of the datastructure, it's about how you use it. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.

I've been in many different ORs and I've found that the rep's knowledge and level of participation varies a lot.  Some of these reps have been working with the same products for years, the doc fully trusts them, and could probably perform the procedure themselves.  Others not so much. reply",

          "text": "I’m working on an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

I am helping my friend by working at his stealth AI startup company. Previously, I worked at Amazon. I started software engineering to solve real-world problems with software, and that is what keeps me on my way. I define what the problem is, understand why to solve it, design how to solve it with code, write code to do that, evaluate the result after writing code, and repeat the cycle. I am a result-driven developer. Writing code itself does not give me dopamine, meaning that I don’t add features that the end-users do not care about. I am looking for where there is a lot to do, solving real-world problems, a hunger to learn exists, and everyone is collaborative and fun to work with. reply",

I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it! reply",

I am looking for my break to get into the contemporary software development scene, after having previously developed software (primarily Windows utilities) on my own and having dabbled in various technologies.  This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team.  An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development.  It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking. On the service-side, I’ve worked with traditional service hosting, containers, and serverless, including (but not limited to) AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Workers, CloudFormation, SAM CLI, nodejs, bunjs, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, grpc, Redis, Docker, nginx, and a few legacy tools best left unnamed (yes, including CodeIgniter and ftp). I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

While my core competency is frontend and the React ecosystem, I can navigate the full stack confidently and contribute to most any codebase.  I've worked on products sitting atop PHP, C#/.NET, Python, Rails and Node. The bulk of my experience is in startups (B2C, B2B & SaaS), though I am open to any organization that provides a strong culture fit.  In my experience, culture and team dynamics far outways what is being built - or the tech that is being used.  I am growth oriented and passionate about working collaboratively, cross-functionally, and making a meaningful impact in people's lives with what is built. I'm also unafraid of legacy code or tech debt. Note: My current role and location is in St Thomas, USVI.  After my last startup role, my family and I decided to try something new and see if life in the Virgin Islands could work for us.  In short, it did not.  My family is already in WA, and I am here finishing up my role as IT Coordinator.  I will be joining my family in WA at the end of November. reply",

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and are already rolling out across some of the largest care chains across Europe, including most of the NHS. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We’re especially keen to talk to Staff Engineers (backend) and Senior AI Engineers (e.g. LLMs and the scaffolding around, computer-use agents) Even if we don’t have a role out  your specific skill set, we’d love to talk!

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want. We're getting big enough to start splitting into more focused teams and there's a few different areas that we need; our infra needs a lot of work, we have big dreams for some cool AI agent/pipeline work and there's still a lot of more fundamental phone system specific problems we need to solve. We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can! You'll need to visit our London office roughly once a month. Email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring? reply",

That inspiring startup will take new sources of funding and chase new customers and leave you behind, on its own trajectory of eventual oblivion. When I frame things this way, I conclude that it's not that \"software quality\" is collapsing, but the quality of specific programs and companies. Success breeds failure. Apple is almost 50 years old. Seems fair to stipulate that some entropy has entered it. Pressure is increasing for some creative destruction. Whose job is it to figure out what should replace your Apple Calculator or Spotify? I'll put it to you that it's your job, along with everyone else's. If a program doesn't work, go find a better program. Create one. Share what works better. Vote with your attention and your dollars and your actual votes for more accountability for big companies.

Of course, there is a lot of context required to make actual conclusions. At many large companies, there is an incentive to create systems that are as complicated as possible. A side effect of that is gaps in what’s actually observable. This manifests itself in shitty user experiences with partially loading pages and widgets or widgets that take multiple times longer to load than other parts of the page. All this is a direct result of large company barriers in communication, crossing between stacks with no single vertical observability solution. At medium sized companies (<9000), it begins to fall apart. A single user request has dozens  of internal hops to arrive at the final API and product managers wonder why a response takes several seconds. reply",

          "text": "I think there’s often a misalignment of incentives when annual perf reviews are judged on feature work delivered not quality. Engineers who spend any time polishing or finding and fixing bugs wind up rated mid, while folks who quickly crank out mediocre or bad code that does something new are on a fast track for promotion. This creates a current in the whole org where PMs, engineers, managers, etc., are all focused on new things all the time. Any quality work has to accompany a new feature proposal for traction, and the quality items in that project will never get cross functional support like the new feature work does. This resource allocation strategy seems rational though. We could consume all available resources endlessly polishing things and never get anything new shipped. Honestly it seems like the another typical example of the “cost center” vs “revenue center” problem. How much should we spend on quality? It’s hard to tell up front. You don’t want to spend any more than the minimum to prevent whatever negative outcomes you think poor quality can cause. Is there any actual $ increase from building higher quality software than “acceptable”? reply",

          "text": "> I would prefer to pay 20% more That's the problem with lemon markets though. They are a feedback loop and usually dependent on asymmetric information. As a simple version think about it this way: if a customer can't tell the difference in quality at time of purchase then the only signal they have is price. I think even here on HN if we're being honest with ourselves it's hard to tell quality prior to purchase. Let alone the average nontechnical person. It's crazy hard to evaluate software even hands on. How much effort you need you put in these days. The difficulty of differentiating sponsored \"reviews\" from legitimate ones. Even all the fake reviews or how Amazon allows changing a product and inheriting the reviews of the old product. No one asks you because all the sellers rely too heavily on their metrics. It's not just AI people treat like black boxes, it's algorithms and metrics in general. But you can't use any of that effectively without context. At engineers I think we should be a bit more grumpy. Our job is to find problems and fix them. Be grumpy to find them. Don't let the little things slip because even though a papercut isn't a big deal, a thousand is. Go in and fix bugs without being asked to. Push back against managers who don't understand. You're the technical expert, not them (even if they were once an engineer, those skills atrophy and you get disconnected from a system when you aren't actively working on it). Don't let them make you make arguments about some made up monetary value for a feature or a fix. It's managements job to worry about money and our job to worry about the product. There needs to be a healthy adversarial process here. When push comes to shove, we should prioritize the product over the profit while they should do the opposite. This contention is a feature, not a bug. Because if we always prioritize profits, well, that's a race to the bottom. It kills innovation. It asks \"what's the shittiest cheapest thing we can sell but people will still buy\". It enables selling hype rather than selling products. So please, be a grumpy engineer. It's in the best interest of the company. Maybe not for the quarter, but it is for the year and the decade. (You don't need to be an asshole or even fight with your boss. Simply raising concerns about foreseeable bugs can be a great place to start. Filling bug reports for errors you find too! Or bugs your friends and family find. Or even help draft them with people like on HN that raise concerns about a product your company works on. Doesn't need to be your specific team, but file the bug report for someone who can't) And as the techies, we should hold high standards. Others rely on us for recommendations. We need to distill the nuances and communicate better with our nontechnical friends and family. These won't solve everything but I believe they are actionable, do not require large asks, and can push some progress. Better something than nothing, otherwise there will be no quality boots to buy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory reply",

The Pareto principle suggests that addressing only the most critical 20% of issues issues yields a disproportionate 80% of the benefits, while the rest of the big bounties yield diminishing marginal returns. We're seeing bugs in bigger slices because technology is, overall, a bigger pie. Full of bugs. The bigger the pie, the easier it is to eat around them. Another principle at play might be \"induced demand,\" most notoriously illustrated by widening highways, but might just as well apply to the widening of RAM. Are we profligate consumers of our rareified, finite computing substrate? Perhaps, but the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem suggests that anything less than 50% waste heat would slow us down. What's the rush? That's above my pay grade. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see any sort of moral, procedural, or ideological decay at fault.

The lure of a well paid career tempts many to the world of software engineering even if they're not very good at it. Look at the construction industry.  Many buildings on this planet were built hundreds, sometimes a thousand or more years ago.  They still stand today as the quality of their build quality was excellent. A house built today of cheap materials (i.e poor quality software engineers) as quickly as possible (i.e urgent business timelines) will fall apart in 30 years while older properties will continue to stand tall long after the \"modern\" house has crumbled. These days software is often about being first to market with quality (and cough security) being a distant second priority. However occasionally software does emerge as high quality and becomes a foundation for further software.  Take Linux, FreeBSD and curl as examples of this.  Their quality control is very high priority and time has proven this to be beneficial - for every user. reply",

For example, if I'm working with an unfamiliar library I might ask an LLM what the incantation is to do something, and then check it by reading the docs of each thing that it references.

          "text": "To me, a big reason is that people who don't understand how it works have a say in how it should be done. It's not the case in traditional engineering fields: when you build a dam, the manager cannot say \"hmm just use half as much concrete here, it will be faster and nobody will realise\". Because people can go to jail for that. The engineers know that they need to make it safe, and the managers know that if the engineers say \"it has to be like that for safety\", then the manager just accepts it. In software it's different: nobody is responsible for bad software. Millions of people need to buy a new smartphone because software needs twice as much RAM for no reason? Who cares? So the engineers will be pushed to make what is more profitable: often that's bad software, because users don't have a clue either. Normal people understand the risks if we talk about a bridge or a dam collapsing. But privacy, security, efficiency, not having to buy a new smartphone every 2 years to load Slack? They have no clue about that. They just want to use what the others use, and they don't want to pay for software. And when it's not that, it's downright enshittification: users don't have a choice anymore. reply",

          "text": "This is the core philosophical divide in modern software development. The \"vibe coding MVP\" crowd treats code as disposable—ship fast, validate the idea, and discard it if it doesn't work. The problem: most MVPs never get thrown away. They get customers, then funding, then \"we'll refactor later\" becomes \"we can't afford downtime to refactor.\" That's how you end up with production systems built on prototypes that were never meant to handle real load. I'm with you: if you're not willing to build it properly, don't build it at all. Technical debt compounds faster than most founders realize. The Twitter mob defends vibe coding because it worked once for someone. However, for every success story, there are thousands of companies struggling with unfixable codebases. Do it right or don't do it. There's no \"we'll fix it later\" in production. reply",

And it seems to be essentially a rule that as companies reach a certain threshold of size, the quality of what they produce begins to trend downward until they're eventually replaced by an upstart who then starts their trek towards reaching the threshold of fail. But in modern political and economic times where number must always go up, too big to fail is a thing and anti-trust enforcement isn't (to say nothing of the FTC mostly just ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ with regards to basically any merger/acquisition of big tech), the current batch of companies just keeps growing and growing instead of being naturally replaced. To say nothing of the fact that a lot of startup culture now sees being acquired as the endgame, rather than even dreaming of competing against these monstrosities. reply",

The government bailed them out with billions because they're \"too important to fail.\"\nApple is even bigger. When they start truly failing, governments won't let them collapse—too much infrastructure depends on them.\nBut \"not allowed to fail\" doesn't mean \"allowed to thrive.\" Intel is a zombie now—alive but not really competing. Apple will eventually become the same: massive, declining, propped up by governments, but no longer innovating.\nYou're right—nobody falls anymore. They simply become permanently mediocre monopolies that extract rent while quality continues to degrade. reply",

I feel that software has become vastly more complex, which increases what I call \"trouble nodes.\" These are places where a branch, API junction, abstraction, etc., give space for bugs. The vast complexity means that software does a lot more, but it also means that it is chock-full of trouble nodes, and that it needs to be tested a lot more rigorously than in the past. Another huge problem is dependence on dependencies. Abstracting trouble nodes does not make them go away. It simply puts them into an area that we can't test properly and fix. reply",

For instance, Steve Jobs Apple era is much more focused on quality and attention to detail. Under Tim Cook, Apple shifted from “it just works” to “ship fast, fix in updates.” The difference isn’t complexity it’s priorities. Jobs-era Apple had smaller teams building fewer products with obsessive quality standards. Cook-era Apple has massive teams shipping constantly with “good enough” as the bar. You’re right that testing helps. But when quality becomes optional, no amount of testing infrastructure fixes the cultural problem. We test for “does it work?” not “is it excellent?” These issues passed all automated tests. They just didn’t pass the “would we be embarrassed to ship this?” test. That test doesn’t exist anymore at scale. reply",

A decade of legitimate participation and community contribution was wiped out instantly with no recourse.<p>Has anyone experienced similar incidents? What are the options when legitimate account recovery appeals are automatically denied despite evidence of compromise?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

If an attacker stole a valid cookie (phishing page, malicious extension, or compromised machine), they can ride your session without hitting the 2FA gate. The US IPs plus sudden content spam fits that pattern. The pragmatic checklist I’d run: log out all devices, rotate password and 2FA, switch to a hardware key/WebAuthn, audit browser extensions (disable anything non‑essential), scan the box, and revoke any third‑party app access tied to Reddit. On the policy side, keep a clear timeline of IPs and actions; in my experience, a concise paper trail sometimes gets a human review even when the first appeal doesn’t. Glad the account is back—hopefully it sticks. reply",

          "text": "My understanding is the big difference is REST must have URLs returned in the API responses to access additional data / actions. So in a REST API you'd have a single URL entrypoint that I'll call \"/root\". \"/root\" might then return to you something like: {\n    \"links\": {\n      \"users\": \"/root/users\",\n      \"posts\": \"/root/posts\",\n      \"mail\": \"/root/mail\"\n    }\n  } So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users\" which would return a list of users along with URLs for how to access individual users. So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users/alice\" and the server would return the information on alice along with URLs for actions like sending her a message or deleting her. But all of that interaction is driven from information returned from the server. All the client needed to begin was just the root URL. Most non-REST JSON APIs today communicate their endpoints via an out-of-band API documentation like swagger. Quoting the Fielding: > A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs > [...] > A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypert... reply",

          "text": "One of the big things too is the encoding of type information using the mechanisms the standard interfaces provide. In HTTP, this is accomplished using media types (through the Accept and Content-Type headers as well as a few related ones). These media types can be standard but they can be vendored too[1]. With something like Content-Type: application/json\n\n   {\n       \"name\": \"\",\n       ...\n   } you don't really know much. With something like example/vnd.mycoolapp.user+json, you get typing information (i.e. you know that the representation of /users/me that the server has given you is a JSON variant of a mycoolapp User. (How the types are known is a priori knowledge of the client (but there are standard link relations you can use to reference API documentation, both human-readable and machine-readable)). A good example of this is your web browser: it knows how to display text/html documents of various character sets, probably knows text/plain, might know application/json. The best part is? HTTP has a standard mechanism for defining these link relations even if what you have isn't necessarily amenable to link relations[2] (the Link header). You can use that to navigate through a collection (previous, item, collection, etc), get documentation about the API (service-doc, service-desc), find things that are related (related), get STUN and TURN information (ice-server), etc. I doubt very much of this is used in practice, but there are a very rich set of standardized relationships that could be used here. (A lot of people admittedly assume \"using PUT in a couple of places\" is doing REST or that not calling all of your method endpoints doAction.pl or whatever is \"RESTful\" and I think that definition has become so widespread that talking about something that approaches actually doing something that resembles the architectural style tends to require reduplication.)

You see a little bit of in in specs that require something be done a certain way (WHEP in particular requires you send ICE information in ice-server link relations). Part of it probably stems from the fact that a lot of the tooling was built on top of OpenAPI (which had discriminators built in and so people used that for implementing \"sum types\"), etc, and part of that comes from the fact that a lot of HTTP-based APIs basically only take the content portion of the response, ignoring the headers basically entirely (outside of maybe redirects). Relatively speaking I think there aren't that many people that know that it is even really a possibility, let alone use it. (You even see discussions on even whether the status codes are to be used at all, when they were really purpose-built to be generalizable.) This partially is self-reinforcing: the server libraries don't do anything with media types generally outside of maybe a \"FileResponse\"-ish class or function and the client libraries don't tend to implement it because it's not supported. Part of it too may be that interoperability isn't necessarily an underlying goal. > one other thought, I'm starting to see how the semantic web fits into this vision.

          "text": "SOAP was actually pretty easy to use, once it settled out. For the most part, everyone used some kind of SDK that translated WSDL (Web Services Description Language) specifications to their chosen language. So you could define almost any function - like PostBlog(Blog blog), and then publish it as a WSDL interface to be consumed by a client. We could have a Java server, with a C# client, and it more or less just worked. We used it with things like signatures, so the data in the message wasn't tampered with. Why did it stop getting popular? It probably really started to fall out of favor when Java/C# stopped being some of the more popular programming languages for web development, and PHP and Ruby got a lot more momentum. The idea was that REST/JSON interfaces would be easier to understand, as we would have a hypermedia interface. There was sort of an attempt to make a RESTy interface work with XML, called WebDAV, that Microsoft Office supported for a while, but it was pretty hard to work with.

The second problem is that XML technologies were too smart. Most developers aren’t that smart and had absolutely no imagination necessary to implement any of this amazing smartness. JSON kind of, but not really, killed XML. It’s like how people believe Netflix killed Blockbuster. Blockbuster died because of financial failures due to too rapid late stage expansion and format conversion. Netflix would have killed Blockbuster later had Blockbuster not killed itself first. JSON and XML are kind of like that. JSON allowed for nested data structures but JSON tried to be smart. To the contrary JSON tried to be as dumb as possible, not as dumb as CSV, but pretty close. What amazes me in all of this is that people are still using HTTP for so much data interchange like it’s still the late 90s. Yeah, I understand it’s ubiquitous and sessionless but after that it’s all downhill and extremely fragile for any kind of wholesale large data replication or it costs too much at the thread level for massively parallel operations. reply",

          "text": "One thing I would mention is that COM and CORBA have explicit support for object references, which is a concept that disappeared from later protocols. With these technologies, a server can return a reference to, say, a Person. The client can then do \"person.GetName()\" or similar. The method calls are implemented as \"stubs\" that act as proxies that simply send the RPC along with the references to the objects they operate on. The server-side RPC implementation keeps a mapping between references and actual in-memory objects, so that calls to references call the right thing in the server process. The benefit is that you can work with APIs in ways that feel natural. You can do \"persons.GetPerson(\"123\").GetEmployer().GetEmployees()\" or whatever — everything feels like you're working with in-memory objects. This has drawbacks. One is that the cost of method calls is obscured by this \"referential transparency\", as it's never obvious what is remote or local. Another problem is that the server is required to keep an object around until a client releases it or dies. If the client dies without first releasing, the objects will live until a keepalive timer triggers. But because a malformed client can keep objects around, the system is vulnerable to high memory use (and abuse). In the end you'd often end up holding a whole graph of objects, and nothing would be released until all references were released. Leak can be difficult to find. My knowledge of COM/CORBA may be incomplete, but never understood why the server couldn't implement these in terms of \"locators\". For example, if a server has a \"GetPerson(string id) -> Person\" type method, rather than sending an object reference that points to an in-memory person object, it could return a lightweight, opaque string like \"person:123\". Any time the client's internal proxy passed this back to the server, the server could look it up; the glue needed to resolve these identifiers back into real objects would be a little more work on the part of the developer, but it would sidestep the whole need to keep objects around. And they could cached quite easily. Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. However, it does this in a pretty different way with different pros and cons. [1] https://blog.cloudflare.com/capnweb-javascript-rpc-library/ reply",

          "text": "> Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. Cap'n Proto does it too, and has been around since 2013. We use it extensively it the implementation of Cloudflare Workers. Many people have joined the team, initially thought \"what is this weird thing? Why don't we just use gRPC instead?\", and then after a few months of using it decided it's actually a superpower. I'm planning to write more about this on the Cloudflare blog in the next couple months, probably. (Cap'n Proto is itself based on CapTP, the protocol used in the E programming language.) I never actually used COM nor CORBA, but my impression is there's a few reasons they didn't work where Cap'n Proto does: 1. Excessive complexity. CORBA is a monstrously large standard, covering not just protocol but also system architecture (\"Object Resource Brokers\"). 2. Lack of asynchronous programming. CORBA calls would synchronously block the calling thread until the call completed. But when making calls over a network (rather than locally), it's much more important that you be able to do other things while you wait. CORBA added (extremely complex) asynchronous I/O support late in its life but few people ever used it. 3. Lack of promise pipelining. This sort of follows from #2 (at least, I don't know how you'd express promise pipelining if you don't have promises to start with). Without promise pipelining, it's incredibly hard to design composable interfaces, because they cannot be composed without adding a round trip for every call. So instead you end up pushed towards big batch requests, but those don't play well with object-oriented API design. 4. Poor lifecycle management. An object reference in CORBA was (I am told) \"just data\", which could be copied anywhere and then used. The server had no real way of being notified when the object reference was no longer needed, unless clients proactively told it so (but this was up to the app). Cap'n Proto ties object lifetime to connections, so when a connection is lost, all the object references held across it are automatically disposed. Cap'n Proto's client libraries are also designed to carefully track the lifecycle of a reference within the client app, so that as soon as it goes out-of-scope (GC'd, destructor runs, etc.), a message can be sent to the server letting it know. This works pretty well. 5. Bad security model. All objects existed in a global namespace and any client could connect to any object. Access control lists had to be maintained to decide which clients were allowed access to which objects. This is a bolted-on security mechanism that sounds simple but in practice is extremely tedious and error-prone, and often people would avoid it by implementing coarse-grained security models. Cap'n Proto implements an object-capability model, aka capability-based security. There is no global namespace of objects. To access one, you have to first receive an object reference from someone who already has one. Passing someone an object reference implies giving them permission to use it. This may at first sound more complicated, but in practice it turns out to map very cleanly to common object-oriented API design patterns. As a result of all this, in Cap'n Proto (and Cap'n Web), you can pretty much use the exact same API design patterns you'd use in a modern programming language, with lots of composable objects and methods, and it's all safe and efficient.

          "text": "I'm one of the thankfully few people in the world who worked on an implementation of DCOM (in my case, for Wine, although by coincidence I had a university lecturer who did the same for QNX). They're very similar systems. I think some of that is true and mattered, some of it is true and didn't matter much, and there's some aspects missing. Neither DCOM nor CORBA worked well over the internet. DCOM was designed in an era when Bill Gates was publicly shitting on the internet and saying the future was closed BBS networks like CompuServe, AOL and MSN. Microsoft didn't have a reasonable internet strategy back then, even TCP/IP support was kinda ropey. So DCOM assumed an entirely flat network in which every machine had a unique network address,  was up all the time, there were no firewalls anywhere and encryption wasn't needed. As a consequence passing a callback to an object - a very OOP and idiomatic thing to do - meant the server would try to connect back to the client. Every RPC system back then made this mistake, also in the UNIX world with Java's RPC system (RMI), Sun RPC etc. Thus every client in these architectures was also a server. This idea was just about tenable up until the DSL rollout and teenagers started noticing that every Windows XP box on the internet was also a server with a bunch of exposed RPC interfaces, all of which was connected to piles of crappy old C++ riddled with memory safety bugs. After a few megaworms Microsoft pushed updates that added a firewall and closed the entire RPC port by default, instead of providing any kind of finer grained support for firewalling at the object exporter level, and that was the end of any chance of using this 90s generation of RPC. HTTP, on the other hand, had a very clear notion of what was a server and what was a client. It also had SSL/TLS, developed by Netscape for the web, which was one of the first cryptographic protocols. We take it for granted now but stuff like DCOM had no equivalent and no effort to develop any. After all, objects are exported over wired ethernet ports at your office, right? Why would you need any encryption? The need for it on the web was driven by eCommerce but nobdy used DCOM or CORBA for exporting shops over the network. Systems like DCOM did have object capabilities and lifecycle handling, but that wasn't terribly useful because the default timeout on pings was absurdly high, like 20 minutes or something, and so in practice the ability to hold references to stateful objects could cause memory leaks accidentally and of course the moment anyone wanted to DoS attack you it was all over. reply",

So, the real answer to your question is dependent on what companies are actually \"building\" something versus which are simply slapping together a bunch of things (I am not against either, if my phrasing suggested otherwise!). A lot of companies and research groups are emerging where you do need ML theory and hence ML engineers. Take for example PPFL (Privacy Preserving Federated Learning) or similar fields. reply",

          "text": "1. All the changes in AI from the past couple of years have only increased demand for MLEs. The job profile kind of widened too, - MLE has always been a subset of SWE but even more so if you're working with LLMs. So some MLE jobs will still require a lot of theory, some won't, but they all require some understanding of AI/ML. You kind of need to know what you want to work on instead of targeting specific job titles (which can be hard to navigate if you're early in your career and have no experience). 2. Overall market dynamics still apply - the increase from 1. is relative to the market i.e. if the market has been tough for other roles like frontend for example, it has been less tough for MLEs because they work on the thing that's exciting at the moment. 3. Should new grads focus on it? New grads will likely have a difficult time regardless of what they decide to do - maybe in a couple of years there won't be excitement around AI/ML, maybe there will be more, maybe something else will be hot. The overall market almost certainly be different, and that could be for the better or worse. Hard to predict the future. Whatever you decide to do early in your career, know that you're not married to it forever. Develop general skills that can be applied in many areas. reply",

I don't think I can offer advice on whether new grads should focus on it or not.

          "text": "As a mostly java dev, I choose Rails 8 w/ Jumpstart Pro [1] for my latest startup and it's been a joy to work with. There is something about Rails' convention over configuration that plays really well with LLMs, and I love not having to fiddle with _too_ much javascript (it's still tbd whether hotwire and stimulus is actually better than react from my POV). I've recently started also exploring Hotwire Native to get mobile apps launched and so far have been really impressed that it \"mostly just works\". If I'm successful, I'm sure I will get to a scale where I'm wishing for static typing, but so far I've been able to accomplish way more with Rails in the same amount of time than I have in any other stack. To answer your question, I'm very open to paying for features that I think will save me time (such as JumpStart). From what I've read, however, I think that's a hard road to go down to be frank.
