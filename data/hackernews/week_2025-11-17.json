        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Before we sat around screens we sat around campfires telling stories. We’re hardwired to be storytellers, and that’s how we fundamentally connect with other people and understand the world.<p>I’ve been thinking about how KISS a small team could go and still stay productive and aligned. This is my take:<p>1) The story unfolds. Repeating meetings where team hash out the next steps to be done before the next meeting<p>2) The plot. A plain text document in the repo showing what has been done, what needs doing, and any related notes or comments<p>Here is an example of the plain text story/narrative of the project:<p>```<p># Project: Cloud Cost Dashboard<p>Enable easy access to cloud cost data for the team.<p>## Integration<p>DONE Cloud cost API integrated with billing system @bob<p>## Dash board<p>Dashboard must pull data from AWS, Azure, and GCP for comparison.<p>TODO Set up a cloud cost reporting dashboard @alice  \nTODO Train team on how to use the dashboard @alice<p>```<p>The following rules apply:<p>- A task is either in status TODO or DONE and it fits exactly on one line<p>- Add @name to assign tasks<p>- New TODOs are added at the bottom (so look there for tasks to pick)<p>- Feel free to add any free text/notes etc to the file to provide context and insight<p>As the project progresses the story unfolds and self documents.<p>BONUS: Use the task line for the commit message<p>Some questions:<p>- Does this approach seem like enough to keep a small team productive and focused?<p>- What essentials are missing (given a small team context)?<p>Would love to hear your thoughts!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Extreme Programming is about the lightest \"methodology\".  I've seen it used on a team of 30 (20 devs, 10 QA).  It scaled that far, but we had a couple of exceptional \"XP masters\" on our team (just as devs, but they kind of owned the methodology as well). That eventually fell apart, because upper management couldn't understand agile development, and so they killed it.  Never mind that it delivered on time. But on a small team (4-5 people), I have seen even less process.  There was a manager who coded half-time.  There was an overall direction, and discussions as needed.  Each person had their area of specialty within the code.  There were code reviews before checkin, but the code reviews were over-the-shoulder in someone's cube.  There was a bug database, but there was no JIRA or other \"ticket\" system.  (There eventually was, after the team grew.  And there eventually was a quarterly planning meeting.) There was a weekly standup for the larger team (20 people).  But within the smaller team, each person kept their own to-do list.  When your code needed to interface with someone else's, the two of you would hammer out what the interface was. That won't scale too far.  And it risks the mismatch with upper management that the XP team ran into.  But for a small team, it can work. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Lately, I’ve noticed a new trend on X: Devs (and indie hackers in particular) are ditching cloud providers and jumping straight to bare-metal servers like Hetzner.<p>Honestly, I think the big cloud companies just haven’t kept up. Their services feel clunky compared to the standalone alternatives. Just try comparing Vercel’s dev experience to Amplify’s, and you’ll see what I mean. On top of that, AWS has gotten way stingier with startup credits.<p>Put those two together, and it’s no surprise fewer people are hosting their MVPs on AWS. It’s tough to stay under $150/month with a database and a server, while on bare metal you can grab 16 GB RAM for around $20/month.<p>- Do you think the cloud is actually losing ground?\n- And for those using bare-metal: how do you handle DB backups, CI/CD, and pulling logs?\n- Would you scale something using bare-metal servers?<p>[Carlos](https://github.com/clostao)</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Cloud is not losing ground but also Cloud computing is also not suitable for every business problem. Its killer feature for businesses with fluctuating usage profiles and \"busy\" seasons.  Think like a tax related application for businesses, in the US, they have to file quarterly and annual. There are probably busy seasons where there would likely be more activity so a cloud compute environment where you can scale up to handle the load with a couple commands is ideal and then scale it down (and lower your costs) during slow times. Indie hackers and small < 10 people startups don't need cloud. However its easier to get moving and scale up and you can just tie in all sorts of other services to make your life easier. If you're on-prem or managing VMs you need to figure out a lot of infrastructure things, networking, security, logging, failover, etc. Then there is transferring risk. If you host your own infrastructure and you have an outage unrelated to HW or data center, that is entirely on you and to be honest will probably happen more frequently than using cloud. When your cloud provider is down, if its a household name, everyone already knows because everything else they use is probably having issues too. Much easier explanation to customers, they likely won't leave over a cloud outage. reply",

          "text": "> Hetzner offers options in all those dimensions, but not in the price the question mentions. Again, incorrect (sorry) . $30/m as opposed to $20. Their mistake, I suppose. /s Call it a typo and move on. Rhetorical: how that confuses the question for you, confuses me. Before we bemoan 'a 50% cost increase', consider: this does quadruple the memory. An additional 48GB on the dedicated non-virtualized box. See: https://www.hetzner.com/sb/ IMO, the $10 on top of $20 is a pittance. Beyond the memory, bonus points: a spare SSD. A small price to reduce administrivia and gain redundancy! Anyway, pedantry aside, all of this is the question: what does your value judgement look like? You're clearly somewhat familiar with the offerings. Hopefully more-so, now. While I'm rambling/have the floor, some tangents: 1. it hasn't made a lot of sense/cents to offer a dedicated *physical* machine with 16GB of memory in quite some time. Now, Cloud? Absolutely. Simplifies Tetris. Physical, though? A knock-off Tamagotchi might make more money after considering power, IPs, and module density for the DDR generation/platform.\n\n    2. I can see reason for hesitation with Hetzner. While I'm a happy customer, they're well-known for being *very* thorough with identification during on-boarding. To the degree that many are uncomfortable. reply",

          "text": "When someone says “bare metal” to me, it implies that virtualization is a problem for their workloads. I’d be very surprised if there was a mass increase in workloads that was the case for. I’d be surprised if most of Hetzners existing non-virtualization customers even care. When someone says “on premise” I assume they mean they are running some part of the premise. Whether they are leasing rack space in a broader data center or not, I agree that it’s a continuum, but I’d expect on premise to include negotiating energy and network as part. To me, the more interesting question for this conversation is a)how are you paying for compute, are you doing long term lease/purchase of servers or are you getting short term provisioning of a standard sku and b) are you using “value added” services. Are you provisioning your own data warehouses, specialized database clusters etc, or are you using a managed service? The distinction between a vm on a hyper scalar and per hour provisioning of hetzner compute (virtualized or not) seems pretty straightforward and I’d be shocked if there was some mass migration of those workloads away from the big clouds. I have done workloads where virtualization very much matters and the physical locality of the servers makes a big difference and we are seeing the opposite happen, the cloud providers are dipping their toe in that market which has been closed to them. reply",

I do a lot of NYT puzzle stuff every day and some other random puzzle sites before I get out of bed. That said, I'm over 40, love puzzles, love complicated board games, went through your brief explainer, and could not get a sensible handle on how to even start this thing. A new player has to really care about how to even try to begin to figure out whatever this is. I gave it about 20 seconds after the \"how does it work?\" Honestly, I gave up. I'm really not trying to rain on your parade. You might find a niche audience, and it'll be what you're going for, but I think you need a much, much better rules explainer if you want to be even remotely in the vicinity of a Wordle-level banger. This thing might be really awesome, but not being able to figure out how to use it is a hard out for me. reply",

Did you try the Practice Puzzle or jump right into the daily? Practice puzzle: https://tiledwords.com/puzzles/practice It sounds like you read the instructions but they weren’t enough. Maybe a video explainer would be better? Does the gameplay recording on this Reddit post help at all? https://www.reddit.com/r/DestroyMyGame/comments/1osxb2q/i_re... People really seem to like it once it clicks (Over 1100 people have finished the daily puzzle so far today) but there is a steep learning curve and I’d love to learn how to help people get past that initial hump. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the note! This part needs work and I really appreciate the call out. I'll try to explain here to share, and maybe clarify my own thinking. Getting any of the guesses right counts as a win, and you get different guessing slabs for each guess (this latter part isn't made at all clear upfront). If you have a rule in your head like \"no red\", but the true rule is \"no red or orange\", it's possible that on the guessing slabs those two rules evaluate to the same things (e.g. there weren't any oranges present in the guessing slabs). You could then try the rest of the guessing slabs, which might have an example where you get it wrong, giving more gameplay. I wanted to give a victory on any subset of 5 slabs guessed successfully since trying to get all the guesses is very hard (especially the first guess on many puzzles), and you can get new information from guesses which fail, which offers some progression. Hence getting \"you won\" and the ability to reveal the rule (I've also thought about keeping the reveal unavailable until you do all guesses) and the invitation to keep playing. If you have a minute I'd love to hear from you if that makes sense and if you have thoughts about what might make more sense. I've also tried to consider ways of restructuring the gameplay, e.g. automatically progressing to the next set of guessing slabs, such that the flow here is less confusing. Thanks for playing, and for sharing! reply",

I think it is also important to realize/point out that we do a lot of projecting and our child may have very different interests. Not saying that applies to you evolve2k , just wanted to make the general point. I set up a Linux machine with our daughter and while it was initially ok, she did not have much interest in the power/freedom and it only became a nuisance for her. Her school/friends use PowerPoint - there is a lot of friction trying work with them in LibreOffice. She wanted to do DTP-like things several times and the Linux options are not exactly... user-friendly. Etc. In the end we got her a Mac Mini. She can still open a terminal, use Homebrew, etc. if she ever develops an interest. Heck, she can use most free software. However, she can also do the stuff she is currently interested in much more easily. E.g., she uses Swift Publisher, which is a very simple/user-friendly DTP program, can collaborate on PowerPoint presentations when needed, etc. First and foremost listen to what your child is interested in. reply",

Multiplayer is a special category of risk in my opinion because I was an ever quest player and I built a feeling of responsibility toward the players that were relying on me and this led me away from schoolwork. I'm trying to avoid that same pitfall by still allowing them to game, even in a multiplayer setting, just only to a limited degree.

          "text": "I'm proud of my decisions and I'm not here to defend them. I'm here for the conversation because I'm interested in the topic. I vetoed Minecraft and replaced it with MineTest because Minecraft has the  hypixel community, which is essentially an MMO that's built inside of the world of Minecraft and dominates the Minecraft playerbase. I was worried that my 11-year-old would be too young to deal with a massively multiplayer game like that, so I prohibited Minecraft for him. The original joy of Minecraft when I first bought it off of Notch's site in 2009 was that you could build things and exercise creativity. I found that in the MMO versions of Minecraft, this is less of a focus. So instead I host a docker container with a minetest instance that we can all build in together. I also vetoed Roblox because I feel that the entire economy in that game is going to be a net negative, particularly the aspect where kids beg their parents to use real money to buy them Robux. But to your point, the list of things I veto is pretty small: I'm socially very liberal, and so the main thing I'm trying to filter for is games that are exploitative of their playerbase in some way. In the case of Battlefield and Fortnite, since I used those examples earlier, these are both games that my kids have independently decided they are not interested in; I think some folks read my original comment that I had removed Battlefield and Fortnite from my household. But if you look at my phrasing, I used the passive voice because it was basically a group decision to never really pick them up. I'm using weasel language because they sometimes go over their neighbor's house and have experience with those games, so I don't want to make it out like they've never played them at all. reply",

          "text": "When I think about enduring titles, I think about whether the kind of game that you'd pick up 20 years later and still consider to be a good game. I raised them on a curriculum of games starting with 80s titles and as they got older I progressed them all the way up into the 2020s so they would have a perspective on where particular gameplay mechanics came from. I see your point about the longevity of the Battlefield series and Fortnite, but my impression is people don't go back and play earlier Battlefield titles: I have always viewed them a little bit like the FIFA titles where there is a constant treadmill of needing to buy the latest version of the game. This is not true for Dark Souls, for example -- it's a sort of game you could play in decades and it would be as much of a masterpiece then it is today. I didn't really mean to compare the titles, but rather to use them as examples of titles that I would approve or disapprove of. My kids choose the games they play, but I exercise judgment in vetoing certain decisions. My example of the From Software titles were not games that I bought for them, or even played (in the case of Elden Ring), but rather titles that my boys were into because of their friend group playing it. They've been playing Night Reign lately and enjoying it. I think people read into my dismissal of Battlefield and Fortnite as indicative of some much larger pattern that they've had a really bad experience with, but I'm not sure that conclusion is warranted. reply",

There are tons, it really just depends on what you want to play. Looking at my steam library (installed only, so I can verify there's a LAN option) gives me: Misery, Necesse, Voyagers of Nera, Infinite Rails, Windward Horizon, 7 Days to Die, HumanitZ, Barotrauma, Avorion Keep in mind that those are just from the MP games I have currently installed, that are from 2020 onwards. I have 131 mp games from that release period, and only 33 of those are installed, and I only checked games that I figured would be likely candidates (i.e. I excluded Sniper Elite 5, Remnant 2, MechWarrior 5, etc). So yeah, LAN/ direct IP connect options are still really common, it's just something to check beforehand. Also, the genre really changes the likelihood of having it. reply",

Do not get me wrong - I run Linux on all of my personal machines today, I play games on them, I know what's the state of gaming on Linux. I also know that every now and then I will get to at the very least read some logs to figure out what's going wrong, e.g. the native port of Civ VI was looking for a version of openssl whose time had passed. Further, relying on Wine/Proton inherently means you will always lag behind the bleeding edge in terms of DX APIs, as  wine/mesa people need to catch up to implement them. Even worse if it is not related to graphics,e.g. as the spatial audio APIs don't have an open source analogue that is ferociously trying to keep up with feature parity. And of course we also have kernel level anti-cheat. I have immense respect for everyone who is involved in making games (and windows software in general) work on Linux. But there will always be stumbling blocks when you are playing 2nd fiddle, and you've not been given the sheets. And nobody told you where the gig is happening. reply",

          "text": "> If you're doing things blindly in Linux, there's no point I digress. Everyone has to start somewhere and not everything has to have a point in the start When I started using linux, I got so fascinated by open source software that I would just search for software/software types and searched open source alternative to X and go to alternativeto or others and try it out etc. I used to copy paste dnf commands in the start and I still remember that phase. I think I learnt linux from myself and have given challenges along the way and I feel like there are things that I have still done blindly along the way (building linux isos) But the fact was that I still felt proud that I was atleast able to replicate the commands and able to have some familiarity with the process. I feel like if I wanted to able to know more about xorriso and cpio to a deeper degree to understand what wizard magic commands I was running to building custom linux iso s etc. Now I don't know about fortnite etc., I am a kid but surprisingly games don't interest me that much, I am way more in my movies / tv shows (just ended dexter s8) right now. There is some alienated feelings when people online my age mention the games they play but I think that games on linux are genuinely great support from what I know and my pc doesn't have anything beyond integrated gpu so yeah my cousins didn't want me to play much games and so they didn't buy a good gpu during the pc and I think they did succeed in this. Its complicated to how I feel the situation or even let alone think how I would even try to approach this situation if or when I become a parent myself. Honestly, parenting can be a bit hard but I still don't know if you should shun something that you think is faddish or low quality partially because I think that the best thing you could do (imo) is educate them on the positives on linux and how they might outweigh the benefits of fortnite in the short to long term in a fun manner. Its um complicated and there is definitely a feeling inside me on that i do some incredibly niche things which would be so complicated to explain to someone my age in my proximity. I think there is only one or two of my friends who actually know even 1% of the stuff that I do in linux (one of them had installed hyprland because of me haha) reply",

          "text": "As someone actually a teen. It is very interesting to share how I started my linux journey I had only got a computer in 6th grade but I was always fascinated by computers in the sense that I was trying to run blindly termux scripts from youtube etc. to run windows programs or linux etc. and I had even successfully done these things earlier But after 6th grade getting a pc, I was trying to learn some python in covid and uh, lets just say that vscode wasn't happy with a 500 mb ram win 7 pc I even installed droidcam/womic etc. and it was a real treat on using your phone as a camera for sometime during online classes Then uh my cousins and brothers bought me a new pc (technically my mum gave the money, so shoutout to you mom, i love you) and I am still rocking that pc That pc has a very nice specs and they are so good except for one thing which is the gpu. it has just gotten an integrated intel 580 graphics card and barely any high power or mid power games can work on it So I was having some games like valorant,portal etc. but mostly it became minecraft and I wasn't enjoying the other games I was watching a lot of privacy content on youtube at the same time and how invasive microsoft is and how linux is just better in that sense. Now I used to play valorant. It used to work on 60 fps but idk what triggered it to become extremely unplayable for me to the point that it was a godsend if it worked on 20fps Tried doing everything but I realized that I am not playing a game at 20 fps and neither do I want to. It has kernel level access and its created by a game which has some chinese influence and Its not even about politics but I would actually not play american games with kernel level access either That being said, First I thought of just reinstalling windows but then realized that if I am actually going through the hassle of re-installing system then might as well use linux (I thought backups were meh and I didn't have any important stuff [i think] anyways, although I wish I would've backuped my fathers occasional folders but eh its 2-3 years now) Instaled nobara after watching linux experiment. To get the best linux gaming. It is so funny but I thought that nobara/glorious eggroll had built all of this from scratch in start, like It was gnome and I was like wow did he make this and that and that oh my god, so cooool Copy pasting dnf commands :sob: (I guess I am on cachy but old habits die hard regarding copy pasting, I still do it sometimes) Then I went to raw archlinux, it was a mess in the start trying to experiment. I had arch kde and the experience was definitely something Personally I used to play minecraft (with prism launcher) and not many games. And I genuinely wanted to play with arch more than gaming. I then was on arch kde and I think I downloaded some games and tried to run it and lets just say that sailing the seas on linux was a very hacky solution but i was able to do that Lets just say that your boy out here was installing a lot of software bloating disks and wanted minimalism and re-installing systems again and again (and always not making backups,  I think I barely make backups even now :sob:) I went from arch kde -> voidlinux iirc -> artix (realized that non systemd systems can't run vscode etc. a bit of a mess) -> arch hyprland iirc for a very long time and it was here where I tried to genuinely install proton and make games work and it had a very high learning curve (1-2 years flexing my neofetch) -> cachy hyprland (just 1-2 months ago) -> cachyos niri right now Personally I would say that Linux is a W in everything but personally I just didn't have a graphics card at all to play modern games From retrospect, regarding gaming, why not just buy older versions of playstation or xbox, are they not specifically designed for gaming itself. It can be a good physical level of seperation as well I don't know what I do with linux honestly, I just do whatever my heart wants, so if someone asks me my hobbies, I genuinely don't know what to say, tinkering with linux/open source is the answer that I give (building custom linux isos, doing random open source cool stuff etc.) I then go see on normal discord servers, the amount of games people play and I am like damn The number of games I have completed/enjoyed can be counted on both my hands or maybe even just one reply",

Linux is a ton of fun, because it's a toolbox you can, as you say, \"do whatever your heart wants\".  Much of computing has lost that ethos, and I think it's a real step backwards. One of my favorite computer scientists, Alan Perlis, wrote the dedication for a very famous computer science textbook that used to be used to teach students at MIT. The book is sometimes called \"The Wizard Book\", but it's real name is \"The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\".  The dedication said this: > This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the computer. > I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more. I think your journey is a great example of that spirit! reply",

I guess my hobby is computing :p Also feel free to take the comments other people have created regarding you being strict etc. or their opinions etc. in a positive manner. I am sure you want the best for your children and parenting can be complicated and there is no fit one approach and its glad that your children like linux/computing as well Singleplayer support on linux is absolutely top notch imo and its only some very anti kernel leavel  multiplayer cheats supports which get troubled and honestly i am not sure what is the best way to counter against that in linux But there are some good games I can suggest but you might know them as well: Minecraft,Counter strike etc. Although they don't share the open source, they share a similar spirit of modding etc. and its gotten almost mainstream enough. Open source games are mixed story with the only good I know being tuxkart haha I think there is a point in trying to teach children something for their own benefit, since if you might not teach them about open source, I wonder who might teach them (I technically figured things by my own but trying to one up my brother was my motivation, read my other comments to know more) Its a mixed bag and one of the advices I can give with my supremely limited knowledge but maybe you can try to take more advices from similar people etc. whether its on HN etc. and actually try to get more advice from everything to try to find if that was the best equilibria etc. But I mean if your children have no objection (like as an example, I am teen and I also don't have much objections with not playing valorant in fact it was the reason technically I installed linux) SO I guess everything is subjective and we are all just yolo'ing it in this sense but I do think its so crazy that we can comment on this platform and not know each other but have a weird sense of faith that we are talking to a human with similar-ish hobbies/interests living probably hundreds of miles away in an instant.

But yes, I'm a big fan of both Minecraft and Counter-Strike. You have good taste. =)  I understand that MineCraft is taking steps to deobfuscate its source a bit, to embrace modding a bit more.  I was excited to hear that!  The early days with Bucket were a real hack based on decompiled sources, IIRC. Agree with you about discussing things online with others being kind of  crazy; I first ran into the internet in the late 90s, and the ability to find others based on interest was amazing. But as you said, always a measure of faith involved (that they are humans somewhere that are like us and have similar interests). As a guy that makes a lot of choices that put me in a minority, I find that online is often the only place I can actually meet someone with my interests, though I've gotten quite used to this. I would say I run into someone IRL with my interests once every 10 years or so. My kids and I have tons of discussions about all this, and I've been chatting with them about this entire thread for a couple of days now, getting their thoughts and explaining the counter-points that people are offering (I try to steelman opposing views if I'm really passionate about the topic). It's been a fun exercise, both in putting my ego aside a bit, and also stepping into others perspectives. I'm not sure I know anywhere else online I could have conversations quite this way. Again, thanks for reply. Hope to chat again in future threads. =) reply",

          "text": "Personally I always loved computers more than smartphones and really loved the freedom even windows could provide over something like android (in the sense of its interface etc.) I feel that a lot of people my age spend a lot more time on their phones as compared to computers and maybe even using the computer just for gaming or discord or something else (just click open, the games are there in steam, play run, it runs) I feel like it is partially tech's fault as well. Tech really wants us to not interact with things or to create a superapp to abstract everything to get a bigger portion of the cake I personally wouldn't be surprised if with things like AI browsers, we might be coming to the point where they genuinely just convert the whole internet into just a chatbot and would interact with the computer and everything on your behalf in the same interface (most likely) I am pretty sure that if this interface or something similar comes true then most people might not even know about things like www. or internet links in general, and we might be shocked in the same way we are right now to them not knowing what files are. reply",

LibreOffice is way easier to understand as a child, since all the functionality is available and discoverable as a menu/tree structure, as opposed to the toolbar mess of MSOffice.  That might be useful for professionals, but when you are a child, the unpredictability of these ribbons is just confusing.   I just want to format this thing.  Click on it.  Search the ribbon for the thing.  It's not there.  Click slightly differently.  Now the ribbon header changed.  Click that back.  Where is it?  Still not there.  Shit, how do I do that?  Describe it in the browser.  I have no clue, how anything is called.  When I happen to find something, everything is in some foreign language where I can only say \"apple\" and \"house\" in.  Also there are tons of advertisements and useless whitespace everywhere. Screw it, I am just opening Notepad (because Notepad++ is not installed and I will only figure out how to use portable programs from an USB stick in 2.5years)  do some drafts and finish it at home with a sane office program.  In LibreOffice at home, I can find the functionality I need independent of finding out how I need to click on the item to apply it.  Also when I click on something, on the left there is a property window open, which lists all the basic properties I can change. MSOffice has moat for professionals who already know how to use it.  It is not friendly for children who have never used a word processor. Converting MSOffice documents to LibreOffice is not that hard, especially as a child, since my mates also have not used a word processor for decades, and have not used fancy formatting.  And then you come around the corner with a poster designed in Scribus.  They are all like: what you can do that?

There are a huge number of these kinds of people but they don't really generate money as a market segment so MSOffice has completely abandoned them.

The primary reason kids would use office tools is for classwork, which is not dissimilar from job work.

However, once you get into group projects (which are very common, in my experience) being the odd one out who can't work with others is really not good.

And now I am facing the harsh reality of trying to crack leetcode medium/hard problems (something I never managed to do routinely while I was working at this company). Is anyone here in a similar situation or has been in one? If so, how do you keep yourself motivated to solve multiple problems a day, especially knowing you are actually never going to work on such problems as part of an actual job?<p>Edit: I need to practice leetcode because the interview process for almost every software engineering role (especially in the Bay Area) seems to require going through at least one round of coding challenge based on leetcode medium/hard problem. I did not call it out earlier because I thought this is a very obvious point. Perhaps, I should have clarified that I am mostly targeting software engg roles.</p></div>",

Even if you don't want to/are not able to have a daily routine and such, detaching as many activities as possible from volatile things like motivation,mood,etc is extremely useful. That is the most important part. Early on in life it is easy, since you have a clear set of objectively great things to do - do great in school, do great in exams, do great in college, get a great first job, don't screw up health in growing years. So you can force yourself to do those no matter what. Later on in life (post college) it gets harder, since you have to ensure you're not forcing yourself to do something counterproductive, especially in new fields like SWE, where there's no clear industry standard career path yet, or an industry standard anything really. Academia in contrast you can apply this strategy until a lot later. reply",

It is an issue simply because leetcode grinding makes me feel like all my 10+ years of commitment to my previous employer (often foolishly at the expense of my personal well-being) and all the things I have contributed and picked up on the way mean nothing / nada / zilch to my future prospective employers. The whole prep process makes me feel like I need to start from scratch and nothing that I did in the past matters at all. I find this extremely frustrating. reply",

In a world with both Google and AI, why does anyone expect you to memorize the solutions to problems, especially to problems that won't actually be the ones you need to solve on the job? But I wonder if, in order to get a job with the \"just say no\" approach, you need to leave the Bay Area.  I wonder if most places there are so into the \"that's the way it's done\" that they can't see the absurdity of it.  Other places in the country don't seem to be as infatuated with leetcode.  But if you're determined to stay there, then it may be a search to find someone who doesn't use that standard for interviewing. So you have a choice.  Would you rather grind leetcode, or would you rather grind the job search for a place that doesn't interview that way? (I had decent success with Robert Half.  They're a recruiter that actually has a clue about tech people.  They can work with more senior people, which 10 years qualifies you as.  I forget whether they were the ones that led to my most recent role, but I remember being impressed with them as headhunters.  They may be worth a shot in your situation.) reply",

More senior roles typically have very different requirements. I don't need a staff or principal engineer to pass a leetcode test as it typically isn't relevant  to that role.

I hope to revisit it. It's a nice space to be in, a blissful stroll through pedagogy, little history lessons, easy stuff. As I progressed through the readings I worked a healthy number of problems.

If you're wondering why people ghost at the technical when they seemed like great candidates: sometimes, at least, they like engineering because it's a discipline where they can get things \"right\" within some defined band / acceptable tolerance. In interview context, where there's somebody watching and judging, the degree of tolerance is unknown, and you know you won't be given time to choose the most correct approach regardless, and that solving the technical problem is just an indirect proxy for solving the \"is this person a good social fit\" problem (because you know you have the technical ability), all acts as anti-motivator for practicing for leetcode style interviews. Its easier to say \"I just didn't study and that's why I didn't get the job\" than it is to say \"even though I spent a bunch of time optimizing for this interview scenario and know I absolutely aced the technical interview, they still didn't like me.\" Heck, I've been in interviews where I found the technical aspect a relatively easy bar to pass, and I blurted out something strange just to sabotage myself. If they can look past that and still see that I know what I'm doing and bring a lot to the table, I know they are people that I can do my best work with without needing to be constantly second guessing myself in conversation. Some companies seem to forget that interviews go both ways, and that job candidates are screening for something different than what companies are screening for. reply",

So you might want to take the approach that you don't need to get a job that requires a huge amount of of leetcode study; focus on networking or whatever. If you feel you have no choice, though, I wonder if you could try to gather together a group of people who are in a similar situation, in order to do practice sessions. Each person could take turns explaining a leetcode problem on a whiteboard. It would give you interview practice, help you make networking connections, and hopefully make the task less boring and introduce an aspect of accountability. I think you'd have to be careful to make sure that the people involved were friendly and helpful, not make it about one-upmanship. Anyway, that is what I'd do today, if I had the problem that I needed to pass leetcode tests. reply",

          "text": "Personally I don't think \"grinding\" is the right way. The key thing is to truly understand the data structures and algorithms you're working with. Just grinding away is kind of like solving hundreds of difficult integrals and partial differential equations, without really understanding the math 100%, but hoping that you'll meet on a similar problem one day. So first step is to really understand the theory, if you're not completely confident, or feel that there are obvious blind spots / gaps. Next up I find it easier to classy the problems by type. Truth is that most leetcode problems are variations of more general subclasses. You'll have the knapsack problems, and other types. Learn to identify these, and study the more generalized versions of these problems, before you start solving the more specific versions. I'm not saying that grinding is useless, because it can help you on speed and increasing your chances in stumbling on a problem you've solved before. The truth is that there's also an element of speed / efficiency to the LC-style interviews. But I think any sort of grinding should come after all the other things I've mentioned. reply",

Your motivation lies in the answer if you have any. Money alone is not a motivating answer unfortunately, because our subconscious (soul if you will) truly does not care about money and wealth itself. But unfortunately again it is the only real sustainable source of our motivation. There are companies that do not do this shit or at least do very basic just to make sure you’re not a fake programmer. Why do you need motivation to learn leetcode simple? It’s mostly a very basic CS and something you should know already as a developer. reply",

There is an element of denial amongst the HN crowd, commonly saying stuff like \"Well I tried Claude code and it produced garbage\".  Any task with a tight \"write->test->repeat\" loop is going to get AI-trained into oblivion, and we've only 4 years into this LLM disruption. Personally, I'm training up on: infrastructure, systems administration, security and software-architecture - because these are harder to train on given a longer \"write->test->repeat\" cycle, although I'm not in denial that they too will be disrupted. Writing code for any problem - especially Leet-code style problems - is going to be solved by AI eventually.  Don't be left behind. reply",

Private jobs are already low paying. Remote jobs do not come generally to Nepal.I see remote jobs love India and south east asia. I do not get the point of remote job if they are hiring from specific country.\nThe only thing I can do in nepal is public service commission (civil services) and crack computer engineer. But the pay is meagre there as well, unless I am lucky enough to enter central bank of Nepal(NRB).<p>Honestly, it feels like I am pushing not just a wall but universe itself in Nepal. Because nothing is going to happen irrespective of my abilities. I am currently preparing for PSC and I do not believe I will be happy as a PSC engineer even if I end up at NRB(central bank).<p>Something feels missing inside me. I have took countless therapies and what not. They helped me a lot to be where I am at now. I feel scared to try opportunities out of my comfort zone (kathmandu is my comfort zone).<p>As an adult, nobody pushes you, you have to push yourself. I am in a serious deadlock internally. I can decrease the effect using yoga and meditation but that does not troubleshoot the cause. Personally, I want to pursue something academic away from nepal. I believe that would provide me the much needed confidence in my life.</p></p></p></p></div>",

All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role. Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn. Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform. Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas. To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Is anybody still using TUI applications for business?<p>My family company is a wholesale distribution firm (with lightweight manufacturing) and has been using the same TUI application (on prem unix box) since 1993. We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.<p>I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.<p>I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.<p>This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.<p>I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.<p>P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).<p>P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Many (most?) older retail businesses still use TUIs. They're reliable, consistent, and orders of magnitude faster than GUI systems. When I worked ar Sherwin Williams, I got good enough with the TUI that customers could rattle off their orders while I punch it into the computer in real time. It's absolutely crazy that a well designed TUI is so much faster. It turns out that if you never change the UI and every menu item always has the same hotkey, navigating the software becomes muscle memory and your speed is only limited by how fast you can physically push the buttons. The program had many menu options added and removed over the decades, but the crucial part is that the hotkeys and menu indexes never, ever changed. Once you learn that you can pop into a quick order menu with this specific sequence of five keys, you just automatically open the right menu the moment a customer walks up. No thought, just pure reflex. UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. No graphical interface I've ever seen comes even close to the raw utility and speed of these finely tuned TUIs. There is a very, very good reason that the oldest and wealthiest retail businesses still use this ancient software. It works, and it's staggeringly effective, and any conceivable replacement will only be worse. There simply is no effective way to improve it. Edit: I will say that these systems take time and effort to learn. You have to commit these UI paths to memory, which isn't too hard, but in order to be maximally effective, you also have to memorize a lot of product metadata. But the key is that it really doesn't take longer than your ordinary training period to become minimally effective. After that, you just pick up the muscle memory as you go. It's pretty analogous to learning touch typing without trying. Your hands just learn where the keys are and after enough time your brain translates words into keystrokes without active thought. It's a beautiful way to design maximally effective software. We've really lost something very important with the shift to GUI and the shunning of text mode. reply",

          "text": "> UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. I'm going to push back a little on that. For several years, MacOS followed a strong UX convention with consistent keyboard shortcuts, menus, layout order, and more. Similarly, Microsoft started with the same, but with everything reversed. At the time, most major cross-platform apps followed these conventions. Two periods broke these rules: the expansion of web apps and Apple's pivot towards the consolidation of everything into iOS. First was the dawn of web apps. Faced with two opposing standards, web apps didn't know which model to follow. Business sites stuck with MS standards, while design-centric sites followed Mac standards. As those broke consistency, cross-platform apps gave up and defined their own standards. Mobile platforms tried to establish new standards. iOS was mostly successful, but started slipping around iOS 7. Material Design was supposed to standardize Android, but Google used it for all Google products, making it more of a standard for the Google brand than Android. The second started around WWDC 2019. At that point, Apple deprioritized UX standards to focus on architecture updates. The following year, Catalyst was literally a UX catalyst, introducing two competing UX standards for MacOS. From that point forward, Apple really hasn't had a singular UX standard to follow anymore, but they seem to be marching towards iOS standards for all devices. reply",

While in many ways it was better than the GUIs we have now , using the mouse was an absolute must , which prevented it from ever getting as efficient as a TUI.

Its principles combined TUI (then known as CUI) and GUI as well as DSL (domain specific language). A fully architected program having a DSL (domain specific language) had a console much like a macro recorder:  as you used the menus and icons, the console  would show the  commands you could otherwise type in to get the same effect. You could edit the console line and re-execute it. In the 1990s, DSL was a buzzword but if you got it right, your GUI was a power tool. reply",

Mac OS has kept the menus, and added a really useful menu search thing in \"help\", and this is huge. I think sublime text was one of the first to bring the TUI style super-powers into the modern desktop UK, where you press some random keyboard shortcut (e.g. cmd-p in sublime) and you can instantly start typing a command. Another thought I have had for a long time is that when GUIs like Mac and Windows were taking off, they were often described as more \"user friendly\" than TUIs. I always thought this depended on the kind of user. A lot of effort went into prioritising making it possible for an untrained user to use a system, but making it fast for someone with experience was no longer important. reply",

Anything you can do on a Mac (except for entering text) was to be done with, and designed around, the mouse. Keyboard \"shortcuts\", so called as a quicker way to issue (some, but not all) menu commands, were a sop to power users but really were an addition, not essential to use of the program.

I’ve seen the same thing where parts shelves were sorted by manufacturer (to make re-ordering by manufacturer simple). When they moved to automatic inventory, shelves didn’t matter anymore and if a part was made by manu1 but now manu2, they’d keep putting it with manu1 because “that’s where everyone’s gone to look for it for the part 20 years”. All you had to know was who made that part in 2003 when auto-inventory stopped forcing them to be consistent by manufacturer to know which shelf to pick from. Easy!

Almost every function is two or three single letter key-presses away, and after using the application for a while you will have memorized more and more of those. Some frequently used functions have their own special single-key shortcuts as well, so instead of having to press C-P (to open the Clip menu and then select Paste) you can just press the ' key, saving the user a key-press every time they  do that. reply",

You can write a webapp that performs in the same way (modulo the resources needed of course), but it takes extra time and once it works with a mouse there little reasons to put more work for keyboard user (it is not a selling point in most cases).

Often these kinds of systems do run faster than the input, but when they don't, it still works. It's hard to do that with a GUI, you usually can't click (or tap) the button before it shows up and expect it to work... and when it does work like that, it's often undesirable. reply",

          "text": "I remember using a TUI for a Bank in the UK, and them switching to a web-based javascript system. Because the TUI forced keyboard interaction everyone was quick, and we could all fly through the screens finding what we wanted. One benefit was each screen was a fixed size and there was no scroll, so when you pressed the right incantation the answer you wanted appeared in the same portion of the screen every time. You didn't have to hunt for the right place to look. You pressed the keys, which were buffered, looked to the appropriate part of the screen and more often than not the information you required appeared as you looked. Moving to a web based system meant we all had to use mice and spend our days moving them to the correct button on the page all the time. It added hours and hours to the processing. Bring back the TUI! reply",

          "text": "That was not what I tried to say. Brogue, like other similar games, can be played in a TUI mode, in the terminal, or with a GUI. Same game, just different UI implementations, and both tend to be about equally laggy, or usually the GUI version is probably less laggy, since you can just blit glyphs without the overhead of terminal escape codes etc to draw the same symbols in the TUI. And Brogue just uses SDL, not a game engine, so that is not relevant at all. But your snarky reply is probably also wrong anyway, since I would be surprised if there is no business software made using game engines. Tesla is known to have used (but not anymore?) Godot for making GUIs for their in-car displays for instance. I have bought applications (not games) made using both Godot and Unity. Not saying it would be a great idea, in general, to use those engines for business applications, but people are not known for always using the best possible tools, are they, and it certainly would work in theory? Not very familiar with Unity, but Godot has very nice GUI widgets. Same style of WYSIWYG editor like old Visual Basic or Delphi really. You drag widgets to place them on the screen, set properties, add scripts to react to different events. The entire Godot IDE itself, a very non-trivial application, is implemented using Godot's own GUI framework. https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/index.ht... reply",

I am also pursuing a CS degree and I asked the same question here 6 months ago. Since then, this is what I've learned: * Its likely that the slowing of the tech job market wasn't caused by AI, but by a change in the tax code (Section 174) and higher interest rates (companies over-hired during the pandemic when funding was abundant). * LLMs may or may not increase developer productivity [1], and they definitely cannot replace software engineers entirely (and I don't think they ever will - but it depends who you ask) * Anecdotally, finding a summer internship wasn't easy for me, but it also wasn't any harder than it was for my peers in other programs (engineering, finance, etc.). Job hunting is a skill that I think many people in CS don't have because it used to be easy. * I used an agentic IDE extensively to code for my on-campus research job. I still enjoyed the job a lot, and even as an rookie developer, I still felt I played a very valuable role in my job that LLMs could not replace.

So even though things look 'down' now, that does not mean that the down cycle will last forever.  However, surviving through a down period as a new graduate will also not be easy in any regards. As to AI, the current crop of AI (which is bubbling very well, and I believe is running itself quickly towards yet another AI winter [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_winter ]), it may be useful for replacing some percentage of \"head count\" programmers, it is not likely to be replacing the actual creative, good, programmers (i.e., the one's often referred to as 10x).  So the best advice I can give is to strive to really learn your craft such that you can function more towards the 10x side of the spectrum than the \"head count\" side.  That will give you the best assurance of success at present. reply",

          "text": "\"Good choice\" for what? If you're not naturally curious about math, engineering, software and/or hardware, then probably not, otherwise maybe. Tech carpetbaggers out for a steady paycheck detracted from the industry more than AI ever has or will.. these people don't like mastery, learning, or excellence. Self taught but I had my doubts after transferring from CS to EE/CS, but I also took the 10 year route to minimize debt and maximize business work. Ideally, I'd first try out or explore the intended field of work one wants to be a part of before fully committing time, money, and energy on credentials for it. This might take the form of one or more internships, reverse interviews of people in that field, and/or finding interviews about a particular person in that role or company. For anyone already enrolled, I'd still check out internships and such but only change majors if multiple internships were decidedly terrible. Follow fun for you that others find tedious or uninteresting where there is great value requiring human-in-the-loop expertise or effort, e.g., find a defensible niche not exposed to 100% automation. That might be a STEM or financial specialty or sub-specialty that you find more interesting like biomedical informatics, data science, statistics, accounting, or actuary because becoming a generic software engineer is as risky now as becoming a generic systems administrator. Ultimately, it's a personal decision that cannot be offloaded to others requiring some experimental research/trial and error in the real world™. Plus, it needs some luck and finding a mostly positive working environment which tend to be in short supply. Good luck. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a software engineer with about 20 years of experience, and lately I have felt a bit lost about what to do going forward.<p>For the context, I have always been passionate about software engineering, I started very young and have worked in it non stop every since. I mostly worked broadly in web development and have pretty-much mastered all areas and layers of the stack (infra and cloud, databases, backend, network, front-end and even a bit of mobile...). I've also been an indie game dev on my free time ever since.<p>For the last 5~10 years I have not been evolving or learning anymore in my daily job, and feel that I've basically seen everything. It only feels repetitive, and as I've lived through many tech bubbles, I don't get much interested in the major trends because the fundamentals are the same and everything old gets new again.<p>Over the years, I've worked in many companies, from big ones to fresh startups, B2B and B2C, in direct and as a contractor as well as web dev agencies. I've also found out that while I like tech leading and the various design and spec phases of software, I don't like managing people. I do not want to evolve as a CTO either because of those reasons and the endless meetings. But the industry seems to think that the normal path forward is to quit being a developer and manage people instead, which is a totally alien idea to me because it involves completely different skills and knowledge.<p>I am now at a step in my career where I find it impossible to find a company where my knowledge and experience is really valued and useful. I'm often the most senior, more than even the managers and CTOs, but have less power or influence and am just another cog in the machine. I see the mistakes being made and know what it will cost (because I've been there and done that many times), I do my best to explain that and recommend alternatives, but more often than not it still happens anyway.<p>I've long considered switching to game dev professionally since I find that it has a lot more fun and interesting challenge, and I yet have lots of things to learn there. But as a husband and a dad, the reputation of the industry (low salary and crunch time) makes it difficult to seriously consider. I'm now thinking that freelancing my be my best bet going forward, and then explore and build things from here.<p>I know that there are more senior (30, 40+ years...) people around here, so I'm curious to hear your experiences. Did you ever feel the same way, what did you do and how did you finally find a satisfying daily job?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Start by understanding both what you want to do and what you really don't want to do and understand that over time, both of these will probably change. In most organizations, in order to make the most impact, you have to be at Management level. I think this is causing you some conflict, because you want to be impactful, but yet don't want a CTO-type position. As an Individual Contributor, even as a tech lead, people \"above\" you really just want you to keep your head down and keep cranking out product. Like it or not, titles have meaning. If you want to make changes, your position in the company needs to be one where they expect change to come from, or you need to get really good at pushing your ideas to others and you have to know those people well. It's going to be difficult to be an upper-level tech employee at a smaller company and not manage people. The separation between technology lead and manager/supervisor tends to only happen at larger companies that can afford that specialization. It may sound trite, but the reality is that you have to understand just what kind of job you want and then devote your energy towards finding that job. reply",

          "text": "I'm nowhere near as senior as you (12 years). But I've reflected on this a lot recently. I love the technology and feeling like I'm building things, but staying hands on will always limit your scope. Taking the management path improves your scope but the work is - well - just less fun than programming. My answer right now is to try and build more things myself. Small apps, CLIs, retro games. Not libraries or much OSS stuff so much as actual \"products\" that give me creative control and concrete outputs. It's hard to make the time though. Outside of my career I'm also trying to cultivate other works, like my YouTube channel and my writing. Creating a video that 250k people enjoy is at least as meaningful to me as crushing my OKRs We are all mortal beings: there will inevitably be more things to do than time to do it, and it's easier to ruminate on options than commit to something that feels \"suboptimal\". To give an example of that. I spent a lot of time wondering if I should have gone into academia / literary criticism rather than tech, because of a vague sense that because I was very good at something, that's where I should put my efforts. Is that sound reasoning though? I probably achieved more \"value\" for society working as a programmer, than writing about Chaucer. So to summarise it may be a choice of making peace with the lower scope / autonomy of hands on work, and finding that satisfaction outside work. If that suggestion makes your soul revolt, though, it may be you have to compromise and take the managerial path reply",

It's like it was a dirty word and I thought it would be turning my back on what I was good at and enjoyed.  But the truth is, you are no longer enjoying what you previously did and have not grown for 5 to 10 years. Being a leader is not being a line manager.  Managing some people may be part of being a leader, but it's not the main focus.  I manage about 3 people and mostly I just delegate stuff to them.  It's not that hard and isn't what I spend most time on. What I really enjoy is that I get to set direction, come up with the strategy and use my years of experience to build things the right way. So I would advise trying to get into a leadership role and give it a try.  It has to be something where you can really set direction.  You do not want to be a middle manager just doing people management, and there are plenty of roles like that.  Worst case - you get a break from what's driving you mad right now and some fresh perspective.  Best case is you actually find some new passion. reply",

As time went by, I started getting more and more frustrated about the lack of influence I could have on formulating plans and direction, and the number of mistakes I was seeing, as you mentioned as well, and decided to, reluctantly,  accept a formal leadership role, so I've now been a small team lead for a few years.

I would've failed in this new role without it, and more seriously I would've failed the people/teams I manage. Since becoming a manager, I've learned that my 20+ experience as a software engineer is quite valuable and useful for the people I manage. It's different kind of rewarding compared to software engineering work, but rewarding nevertheless. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I don't know if that's helpful for you, but if you do end up considering taking up a managerial leadership role, make sure your employer doesn't just throw you into it and ask you to learn on the job without any support.

Really I have just worked on web-related problems for the last 10 years (first 2 were LinuxRT USB drivers, which I think more and more fondly of these days) and have hit the same crossroads as OP.  The main difference for me I'd say is that I'm actually very serious about moving into management; being an IC these days feels like I am on a never-ending treadmill of boring work.  Add AI to the mix and I have never been less motivated than I am now to continue writing code. So I guess the answer to the question of how I evolved is that I evolved rapidly until my ceiling, which was probably ~6-8 years into my career.  I haven't learned much since, nor have I had to.  Only now do I feel a stronger urge to look where the puck is going and skate towards it, so to speak. reply",

I'm five and a half years already with my current employer and would really appreciate to continue with them further despite obviously like the OP says \"my knowledge is not really valued and useful\" there. The thing is, using my accumulated versatile tech experience and good understanding of how any large enterprise works, and working in IC position, I can really bent my workload/agenda in a way that work becomes more or less fun! Not counting the Teams meetings, an unavoidable evil. :) But even them, I turn them into fun activity too, by generating nice useful minutes using transcripts \"anchored\" either in code or in Confluence pages (with a tool-enabled LLM). Being an individual contributor is important for this, otherwise if you even a level higher, in example, a line manager, you can't really bent your agenda much because you must care for other people and invest your time in helping them to achieve common goals.

I'm mid-40s (I can't believe it) and I made a slightly different move a few years ago into more senior leadership, where I get more say in how things are done. This is precisely for this reason: I felt the larger problems to solve were in how to protect the team both from unnecessary external influences and from (potentially) overly-loud but not sensible people suggesting architectures that would be a lot of time and not a lot of value. I then moved to another company and retained a similar level of seniority. I have different challenges now in having more influence (one sees the problems elsewhere that would be fixed if one were in charge of that as well, but one can become blind to issues within one's purview) but I quite like it overall. The alternative probably is freelancing. Find a niche and occupy it, without charging the earth, and you'll probably do well emotionally and in providing for your family. reply",

I have two children who are in the middle of their studies now and I had the same concerns suggesting a path. I will try to expand a bit. There are manual jobs that are very interesting and work well until 40-50 years old. An example is physiotherapy, where you can concentrate on more dynamic activities when you are young, and move to softer ones later. With the demographics in Western Europe, you are good. Another one is electrician: it is constantly evolving, with major shifts such as home automation and it is reasonably physical (the added value is that you do not keep a static position for the whole day). Importantly, none of the above is at risk with AI or shifts in the market. You always need people to help you physically and you always need electricity. On top of that these jobs are regulated so you can't be short-cut. One of my kids is going this way and it is great. The other one is in Finance, in the best and most competitive school in the world. I see his future as bleak, something I would not have even thought 30 years ago. He will live in slavery for 5-10 years, doing insane hours and without a social life at the moment when it counts the most. He will make heaps of money, without real opportunities to spend it. And he realizes that. As I said, 30 years ago it was unthinkable, at least in my country. A diploma from that elite school was the real way to everything. Your year mates where the future ministers, president, head of national or international institutions. And the weird few who would go for NGOs. All this means that any advice a 50yo will give is heavily impregnated with their past and that past (which was their future when they were young) is fundamentally different from the future of current youngsters. We do not live in an era of fundamental changes as we did in the 90s. reply",

          "text": "I'm about 12 years in myself and can provide some thoughts on this, though I'm not 20+ years senior. My first few roles were in startups, where I got to be very hands on, learn a bunch, and mostly focus on the craft of software development and systems. I similarly felt I had a lack of higher-level understanding of business, management, product, etc. I then went to Amazon for 7 years and this is where I felt I developed a stronger sense of the \"business\" side of things: politics, understanding what your customers really need, influence, delivering massive things across multiples teams and years of effort. > I do my best to explain that and recommend alternatives, but more often than not it still happens anyway. This is difficult to overcome, particularly on a short timescale. I felt this early in my time at Amazon at times, where I felt \"right\" but couldn't get others to see things my way. The path there for me was first developing relationships with my peers generally, then establishing trust for my judgement. This came in the form of chasing ambulances, jumping into technical and non-technical problems unrelated to my direct team (eg: incidents), mentoring others. These activities are generally trust-building, and non-controversial/political. This also build some social capital, such that when I would speak up in a meeting or point out some flaw/gap (with data), people would listen more. I've found it incredibly hard to influence without first establishing solid credibility, and vice-versa, if someone is new to an org, I will certainly listen, but I also don't yet know them/their background/or why I should outright accept their opinion as the truth. Conversely, I have also seen people more senior than myself struggle with this concept. They show up in an org and repeatedly tout their resume, and expect acceptance \"Yeah at X we did things this way\", \"I built x, y, and z\". This has not worked well for them in my opinion. The most influential engineers I've worked with had strong trust based on their actions and history of delivering, helping others, providing opinions backed in data, and being level headed. If they spoke about a problem it was something to listen to, not just a weekly complaint about something else. Lastly, make sure whatever it is you work on truly matters to the business, and understand how it ties back to the business and your customers. It can be fun (or necessary at times) to be off in the weeds on something that is technically interesting, but really unimportant to the bottom line and ultimately to advancing your career. reply",

          "text": "The last thing you want to do is game dev.  They overwork you and underpay you.  You pay the “passion tax”. There is a huge difference between “staff augmentation” where you are just another more disposable cog in the wheel and strategic consulting where they hire you for your specialized experience and you are in the room with people who contribute budgets.  Staff augmentation is a shit show. I have most of the prerequisites at this point to do alright at independent consulting - skillset, network, credentials, customer facing experience, a little sales experience, etc and I wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole.  I like having benefits, a steady paycheck, and the backing of an entire organization. As a husband and a dad, do you really want the hustle, inconsistency and lack of benefits of freelancing? What special skillset do you have that would make companies want to hire you? As far as my history - currently 51. - 1986 - started coding as a hobby in the sixth grade in AppleSoft Basic and assembly - 1996 - 2002 - first job out of college and changed jobs once in 1999 doing C but twiddling across multiple architectures - 2002 - 2008 - career stagnated and became an “expert beginner” at my second job - 2008 - 2016 - changed jobs three times and became a competent enterprise developer.  Regardless of title, I was pulling well defined tickets off the board.  I was a “mid level developer”.  I stuck mostly in the .Net ecosystem. - 2016 - led my first major initiative at my sixth job as the first technical hire by a then new CTO and led the integration of various acquisitions as the PE firm was trying to do the whole rollup small businesses and IPO. I belated discovered AWS. My first job with what I would consider “senior level responsibility” and dealing with strategy - 2018 - I was the second technical hire of a then new CTO of a startup.  Two non technical brothers founded the company and used an external consulting company.  They found PMF and wanted to bring development in house and be “cloud native”.  I became the de facto cloud architect + development and got all of my practical experience with AWS. 2020 - hired at AWS Professional Services - their consulting arm (full time) and pivoted to specializing in “cloud native development” consulting half strategy/half hands on in a mid level (L5) role. 2024 - staff consultant working at a third party cloud consulting firm (full time).  Some pre-sales support, some doing everything myself from leading the project and doing the work (small projects), to leading larger projects and a little managing style consulting. reply",

To balance CPU cycles that run in my head which processes information out of monitor in the physical world. Theory is that, our field is an imaginative field and path we take to reach finishing a task does not remember the path we took. This inturn affects next steps as the judgement or self judgement get weakened. Attacking this challenge from its fundamental is to mimic the work outside computer. Example writing, reading codebase after printing out in paper. This builds a strong memory of size of space of imaginary work in physical space. While paper printing solve reader writer challenge.

          "text": "\" Satisfying daily job \" To answer your question .. Lets make it  \"Satisfying daily job till your last breath\". I have a few more years of experience than you. My response to this was to scale back to hometown and spend more quality time with family. (Aging parents and generation handover) This required some basic inner engineering. (the points are random and not chronologically arranged ) 1. I worked on things which did not require any permission from anyone. There were a lot of pending IT projects for myself which were done half assed. Finally i had time to finish them to my satisfaction. 2. Joined Govt job as a contractor and worked in different department to enable their e-Governance initiatives. I expected it to be long term but soon (4 years) got bored. (IgnoreThis: ADHAAR id , Toll Roads, Social Justice for women and kids , Department of Economics and Statistics, State Planning commission. This coincided with the external factors of Narendra Modi becoming the PM in 2014-till date. Whatever I have worked on is still working and it is some solace but the rot has happened and its not trustworthy anymore since data massaging for beautiful reports is one of painful realities of Govt Work ) 3. Convinced wife to let me take a 6 month break from job and See the action on ground of all these govt projects.  Did that and decided to join startups. 4. Did a lot of pro-bono work in different domains.From WildLife Tiger Reserves to App building for Real estate to working for NGOs and travelling to remote Tier 3 cities and villages and giving seminars on technology and the upcoming changes. ( this was in 2018-19 pre covid). 5. By now yr2020+ tech was changing so furiously, it was hard to keep up. Number of services in AWS just made no sense... Kept working with startups who were NOT using the latest and greatest. They just wanted something to keep them floating on the web. 6. Enabled other revenue sources (no relation to IT) 7. Since then I have connected to the tech ecosystem in a way that suites me. Solidified my credentials as a teacher by giving some govt exams (UGC NET and MPSET as called in this part of world). I love teaching and people have validated it over time. (Engaged in-person 4000 People crowd for 4-5hrs). When you  try something new u get to know your superpowers. ( Failures teach you more, do keep  a log of new things you try. We stop trying after we get few years into a job) 8. Made a lot of friends elder as well as junior with whom I want to spend rest of my life. I love to work with them and its wonderful. I prefer to meet my colleagues and classmates in person.(At least once in few months). 9. I had to let go of the urge to earn as much as I was earning. Getting used to this is pretty difficult choice. I found that saving 1 equates to earning 6 ... so reduced my expenses and this leverage helped a lot. 10. Supported wife to get back on her career. This required a lot of managing as well. (Learning to cook was trial through fire. Today I feel everyone should know how to cook their favorite recipes. It is sheer joy to cook/bake for your friends and family) To summarise, It was a mid-life retirement to find about the world. We stay in our little pond and think this is the whole world. When we explore we end up finding our own  \"self\". What I like and what I do not. What pisses me off and how to manage that without doing a lot of damage to relations and quality of life and that prepares you to do \"Satisfying daily job till your last breath\". PS1: Surprisingly it is easier than ever to do WFH.You need to find the work that you can do better than anyone else using AI as a tool. AI is not a worker .. AI is a tool just like a Mixer/Grinder/Juicer. This is the future of work as I found it to be. PS2: Being a house husband has a lot of social stigma. Remember to keep your spouse happy as this causes emotional roller coaster which is not good for kids. PS3: Experiment with your daily routine. Find your circadian rythm.Keep it for life. reply",

          "text": "Yes I did feel the same, and it boiled down to accepting I had to try something new that I thought I didn’t want or be happy with what I already had . You have several options I guess. - it’s very likely you haven’t mastered all layers of the stack - you maybe have mastered the parts you’ve come across though. Would you include Linux kernel development, program proofs, HPC , math-oriented software, compilers, firmwares, fpgas, database internals ( I mean, writing a full database engine ), big iron infrastructure , actual research etc in the list of things you’ve mastered? That’s what I did for many years ( not necessarily these topics ) - keep exploring , the field is massive. In my experience, the more you look around the more you realize that you haven’t seen it all, and even less mastered it. - now, in my case, after doing just that ( trying new technical things) I realized I was getting increasingly interested in the overall technical strategy and interplay with people more so than the purely technical side of things. I had vowed I would never get into the higher spheres … but  I am now essentially a principal engineer ( or whatever you call that but basically I lead some technical stuff ) for a very large org. This is not management , and I really like it. I keep learning about people and business, about how changing something big is hard and human , and balancing technical problems with human ones . It’s fascinating, and above all grounded in technical knowledge so I don’t feel like I’ve thrown away a significant chunk of my career. In particular, if you feel that you’re not being listened to but would like to, maybe you’d be interested in that kind of job. If you’re saying you’re not always succeeding at persuading people , it probably also means there’s growth for you here, and satisfaction down the line. - actually get into management , which like most topics is actually interesting once you get into it. It’s just different. I thought I didn’t like it - I actually do and that was a colossal surprise to me. Whether it’s technical leadership or management, these skills can be learned, and they make the bits that you don’t like much more palatable, and the bits that are ok very enjoyable. I was lucky enough to meet very good people who taught me properly. I think this is very important. I can cook at home, but if I get proper training my food will be better and I will enjoy the process a lot more ( try chopping vegetables with no training - you’re slow as hell and it ruins everything) - do something unrelated ( cooking etc ). To be honest, at some point I did my job but the more fulfilling exploration part of my life was at home and revolved around food. I did consider changing career completely but decided it was too risky. To a large extent, there is limited value to your extensive knowledge if you remain at the bottom because it will always have limited impact. You seem to want the power and influence ( for good reasons !), but don’t seem to want to learn the skills that are required . ( at least management, you seem interested in technical leadership). I guess you have to choose. It’s very hard, but liberating. You mentioned family - I also made sure I was in a good place at home when I switched. I found it hard but support from my wife helped tremendously. Best of luck ! reply",

Definitely not (except partially a database engine), but I'd definitely like to move down the stack. I like systems programming, low level stuff and optimization problems, so that's maybe the main area that I should explore (and also one of the reasons I like game dev).

          "text": "Becoming a developer. I was an experienced visual web designer. A few months after joining Travelocity I was involuntarily reassigned to a UI developer position. If I wanted to stay employed I had to learn to program. That first year I was shitty at it, occasionally broke stuff, and received a negative annual evaluation. This was 2008. Shortly after that the economy collapsed. There were massive layoffs and a lot of good people were fired. I was not one of the good people and I was not fired. Before jQuery became an obsessive religious cult UI developers were tough to hire. The world was full of UI developers that were so much worse than me. Super incompetent was the industry performance average. Learning to program for real. In 2009 I was picked up for my second military deployment. I am a soldier in the Army Reserves and spent the next year in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan I learned to program for real by writing original applications. After a year of grinding I was still shitty as far as being an actual application developer, but I was orders of magnitude superior compared to the average corporate JavaScript developer. My first career mistake. I managed to pick up the CISSP certification at the end of that deployment. I should have done the work to transition my career to cybersecurity, but lacked the confidence to figure that out. I had a guaranteed job waiting for me Travelocity so I went back to the childish career of web developer. I received 3 raises and a promotion the year I returned to Travelocity. I became a senior when I became the company experimentation engineer for A/B testing. My second career mistake. In 2014 I came back to Travelocity after another year in Afghanistan. At this point Travelocity began to internally implode so I left to explore other opportunities. I should have stayed at Travelocity. Instead I bounced around the market getting small raises at joining each new employer. As the years went by I continued to become more experienced almost entirely due to challenging side projects. The career became progressively more shitty as my average peers seemed progressively more child-like and progressively more fearful of writing code. After 5 years at Bank of America I left there for a work from job for a small company with complete garbage for internal code. I didn’t even make it a year before I was laid off. I made a promise to myself to never go back to the toddler daycare of JavaScript employment. I was picked up by a defense contractor to do work on enterprise API management. Within a year the promoted me into management involuntarily. This is my current job and it’s been amazing. The people are so much more mature that the comparison is beyond words. I wouldn’t go back to JavaScript stupidly unless it’s vanilla JavaScript work to guarantee I would be working with decent people or $500,000 to compensate for working with arrogant children. reply",
