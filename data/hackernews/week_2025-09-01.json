          "text": "I think I know what you are asking but it is complicated. For safety, regulator, historical and frankly common sense reasons, a car is not one system.  It is a system of system that communicate via a CAN BUS, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus .  This is still true for electric cars.  Can this be hacked?  Like everything else, yes. Can you side load a new ROM like an android device?  Not that know of and hope that never becomes a reality because your phone crashing is different than you car crashing (figuratively and literally).  Can you enable/disable features?  Yes, usually through ECU hacking.  On my P3 Volvo, I bought a cheap stripped down Chinese clone of Volvo's diagnostic tool called DiCE.  Once the ECU is decrypted, which is done through brute force, you can use something like https://d5t5.com/article/vdash-volvo-diagnostic or P3Tool to change level settings like the theme of LED dash or engine tuning.

Finally, you can connect a computer to the CAN bus [2], which allows you to capture and replay commands, as well as craft your own commands.

My current setup is whatever is available on Colab Pro+, so I can probably use the 7b-12b range of models?<p>My main question is, which base model would be best for this task?

          "text": "Yeah... I'm far from an expert on state-of-the-art ML, but it feels like a new embedding would invalidate any of the layers you keep. Taking off a late layer makes sense to me, like in cases where you want to use an LLM with a different kind of output head for scoring or something like that, because the basic \"understanding\" layers are still happening in the same numerical space - they're still producing the same \"concepts\", that are just used in a different way, like applying a different algorithm to the same data structure. But if you have a brand new embedding, then you're taking the bottom layer off. Everything else is based on those dimensions. I suppose it's possible that this \"just works\", in that there's enough language-agnostic structure in the intermediate layers that the model can sort of self-heal over the initial embeddings... but that intuitively seems kind of incredible to me. A transformation over vectors from a completely different basis space feels vanishingly unlikely to do anything useful. And doubly so given that we're talking about a low-resource language, which might be more likely to have unusual grammatical or linguistic quirks which self-attention may not know how to handle. reply",

          "text": "Don't fuck with the architecture for no reason. Just fucking don't. If you really, really want to, ALWAYS have a baseline of \"the architecture was not fucked with\" with otherwise similar training at hand, so you can compare. You'll see why. The purpose of using a base model in the first place is to be able to reuse existing learned representations so the model only has to learn the specific task. You propose starting the run off by kicking the base model in the balls and forcing it to relearn a lot of the things that lie at its foundation. While not even doing a full fine tune. And with a dataset that's VERY small for a heavy duty tuning run. I'm not saying it can't work - but I am saying that you'll suffer trying to make it work. Anything fancy you try during the training? Less of a minefield, but, again: keep a baseline to compare things to. 9 out of 10 fancy training ideas fail to outperform the baseline. And quite a few of those 9 underperform the baseline noticeably. For my first run, I'd maybe implement known-good basics like curriculum learning if possible but nothing fancier than that. \"Softened targets\" with semantic similarity off a dictionary might work to improve sample efficiency early into the run, but it's the kind of thing that might hobble your performance further into the run because your dictionary assumptions are worse than what the model could learn on its own, so taper this off at least? POS-tagging might improve things, in a similar way, but only if you find a decent way to feed the known-good tags into the model, which may be as simple as \"put the tags in the square bracket after the words with a \"this is a POS-tagged text\" next to the text, then mask\". The \"extra POS head\" may work but it might be harder to make that work than to rotate the tags into the corpus naively? Keep in mind that those are suggestions I make based on VIBES ONLY, and the only way to know if those vibes are on point or wildly off base is to actually try those runs, because that's how applied ML is. So if you want to get fancy, start off with a small model that's cheap and fast to tune, make sure you can validate performance at least somewhat, and be ready to experiment with your runs a lot. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s). - First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship. - Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer. Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups. Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator ( https://github.com/OperatorFoundation ). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case. In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols. - The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term. I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space). reply",

Even if you can't broadcast from inside a territory you can broadcast from outside. It can be jammed but it is a tough cat and mouse game and jamming isn't precise. So when you jam there are causalities. Not to mention that jamming can be quite expensive. I'm not saying that makes the problem easy, but I'll say that jamming isn't a very strong defense. Though the bigger issue here is probably bandwith. It's hard to be both long range and data dense. There's probably easier ways to distribute this. Hell, both Koreas are known to transport different things via balloons. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia [1] It is also why projects like Tor and Signal get funding from RFA. Maybe the US doesn't want encrypted services here, but if anything, it's for the same reason they do want encrypted services in other countries. reply",

          "text": "Hi, posting from my main account (I'm also the poster of the GP comment). \"Nothing special\" in this case was meant to describe the fact that it's random data with no identifiable patterns inherent to the data; you're absolutely right that that's what obfs4 does. I understand the confusion though, this phrasing could be better. > your government can decide to block unknown protocols This does happen, though when I worked in the industry it wasn't common. Blocking of specific protocols was much more of an obstacle. > you should trick DPI into thinking it sees HTTPS. Unless your government decides to block HTTPS HTTPS blocking (typically based on either the presence of a specific SNI field value, or based on the use of the ESNI/ECH TLS extension) was prolific. I won't comment on whether this was effective or not in impeding efforts to get people in these places connected. I will say though, Operator's Replicant does something similar to what you're describing in that it can mimic unrelated protocols. It's a clever approach, unfortunately it was a bit immature when I was working in that area so the team didn't adopt it while I was around. reply",

DPI might pick up on proxy headers.\nalternatively, idk how far one would get just slapping wireguard or openvpn on a VPS somewhere on port 443. that used to work fairly well but i suppose my experience there is like 10+ years out of date by now. i know a US based tech firm i worked for around 2020 had a simple HTTPS proxy for chinese clients to download content updates. worked really well. it was hosted on some cloud provider and accessible via DNS name. so its not like it wasn't easy to block it. they just didn't bother or it was lost in a sea of other similar activities. that all being said, regarding oppressive regimes and political turmoil situations: \nif your health or freedom is at risk, don't rely on internet people's 'guesswork' (hard to tell where ppl get their info from, and what its based on etc.). be careful. if you are not confident, don't go forward with it. Try to get advice from local experts instead, who are familiar in the specific context you are dealing with. reply",

It's more like the Great Firewalls -- there's regional fragmentation with different vendors, operators, implementations and rules between different parts of the country. Predictably this means there's no one-size-fits-all solution to circumventing censorship on the Chinese internet, and research into this area's difficult since China has both the technical means to identify violations very efficiently as well as the bureaucratic infrastructure to carry out enforcement actions against a considerable portion of those people who violate the GFW rules (with enforcement action being anything from a \"cooldown period\" on your internet connection where you can't make any connections for some amount of time between minutes and days, fines, or imprisonment depending on the type of content you were trying to access). So, the ethics of digging into this get very muddy, very fast. reply",

That was to use Holafly (an international eSIM provider) and use its built-in VPN. China largely doesn’t care if foreigners get around the GFW, I guess. Another method that usually worked was ProtonVPN with protocol set to Wireguard. Not sure why this worked, it’s definitely a lot more detectable than other methods I tried. But as long as I rotated which US server I used every few days, this worked fine. No luck with shadowsocks, ProtonVPN “stealth” mode, Outline+Digital Ocean, or even Jump / Remote Desktop. Jump worked the longest at several hours before it became unbearably slow, I’m still not sure if I was actually throttled or my home computer started misbehaving. I didn’t get around to setting up a pure TLS proxy, or proxying traffic through a domain that serves “legitimate” traffic, so no idea if that still works. reply",

          "text": "DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized). It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself. A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now. In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry. reply",

You might feel trapped, so you pass the time with stuff like YouTube because that is the most compelling thing available to you.  A man will walk on broken glass with a smile if he truly believes in what it will accomplish. When I was younger, I was into video games because they gave me a sense of accomplishment and progress compared to high school, which I found relatively meaningless.  I called it progress quest. When there is a rare game or youtube topic that really obsessively catches your attention, like Factorio, pay attention to it!  It helps show you what drives you, and you can try to leverage that into things you find healthier. Also, it might be worth it to look into ADHD testing if this has been a persistent pattern your entire life. reply",

          "text": "When I was doing a similar schedule, it was a failure of introspection, and a mounting number of unprocessed emotional issues, and unconfronted personal problems. The way I got over it is that I have started realizing, confronting, communicating these issues. I \"sat down with myself\" daily just to think for 15 minutes, without any distraction like youtube. Communicated what I though were my problems to my partner, friends, parents, therapist, forums, LLM. Over time, patterns emerged, either by others pointing them out to me, or them occurring to myself. The patterns became higher and higher level, and I had more and more power and agency to fill in my gaps, and those in turn made my problems smaller, manageable. Challenges, even. I also picked up hobbies that nurture the specific parts that I was lacking. For example, I had a very hard time to persistently care about living things. But after a leap of faith I successfully kept a plant alive, and I slowly build a hobby around this. Funnily enough, youtube helped in this, because I also shaped that so that the helpful videos remained. While doing chores, self-care and other such things, I listened to a lot of mental health, lifestyle, introspective, hobby content, and these were wonderful sources of inspiration. In a way, having a bluetooth headphone also helped a lot. It helped to bridge the gap between the digital world, which was my only comfort zone, and the \"irl\", which was like the cold, hard, overwhelming rest of the world that I didn't really want to deal with. reply",

I am aware of a below-the-radar societal battle over way of life, and proper conduct, and the battleground is haunted by specters of ideas like sin and saintliness. It's these fraught issues that cause \"media addictions\". The nature of the \"addiction\" is doubt and unhappiness over the thing you want to do, where the saintly walking-over-broken-glass things you imagine you ought to want are set against a reactionary avoidance of them, and the meaning of \"want\" is lost in the turmoil. I haven't watched Youtube for ten years, but I will do other unproductive things \"endlessly\".

That's mostly what I did over the last two weeks.) I would like to be so firm in my convictions that I can say \"and I don't care\", but sadly I keep coming back to the idea that I should make some games, or write, or do art. Those are prestigious, pious things to do. It might turn out that my feelings are correct, and I might return to a project and complete it. But I might also be wrong about these self-aggrandizing ideas. I might keep coming back to appearing to be creative only as a kind of defense against appearing unworthy. I might actually idle my days away in a farty, unproductive manner unto death, and that might be what I should do. Whose moral standard is it here?

Then I feel bad about it, go to bed, have terrible sleep, wake up with barely any energy to even get out of bed, and the cycle begins anew. How I manage to actually get enough work done to keep my job is some kind of a miracle, I guess. I've long given up on personal projects or even anime and games. Everything requires too much energy that I don't seem to be able to find, so the comfort zone of YouTube or similar time wasters it is (browsing HN is my latest one, with all due respect to some of the really useful content on this website). All I can say is, try not to be me if you can help it. Vicious cycle, this. Some find therapy or medication helpful, could be worth considering. reply",

Also, once you get some momentum on a better activity, it's easier to stay doing it.  You might have to lock away all your distractions for a few days before you can get immersed in that coding side project (or writing that novella, or that new workout routine).

This makes it easier for me to get into the reading state (sometimes speaking the words is a way to let my inner self really “see” them).

The single most effective thing I did was during my week off when I put my phone in a drawer and mostly stuck to my apple watch for notifications and a keycard for my car. Obviously I need my phone for work, so I've been trying other things to reduce its importance in my life. I moved the TV from the room with the sofas to the room with chairs.  I wind up spending more time in conversation with my wife or my friends on those sofas, rather than \"Hey check out this video I saw..\". I've also replaced my phone with my watch for stuff involving unlocking car, and using a mostly-offline Linux handheld device with custom apps to replace stuff on my phone.  You'd be surprised how many things don't require internet access; books and videos can be cached, and other things (paying credit cards, etc..) can be done on a desktop. reply",

(Just in case you're looking at a second screen instead of them? idunno folks, but it's unbearable to me). So I made a script that downloads all the content on the selected channels beyond a certain date (all of it was too much to store), and I serve it on a Jellyfin server. No algorithm, no unlimited content to browse, just a large but finite selection of content from a selected list of channels (only 2 in our case!) which only updates when I run the script. reply",

I'm not sure if you only have to disable history or some other options as well, but basically you want a blank screen when you reach yt.

Extremely locked down screen time rules are necessary - break the exciting loop of picking up your phone, eventually you'll re-associate the phone when each time you pick it up you're met with disappointment that nothing exciting is allowed. Life just slows down in a way that allows you to appreciate little things, make better decisions and treat people with more empathy, read more, reflect on life, get better sleep. ADHD is easier to manage. Less decision fatigue and general mental fatigue (I personally feel that scrolling/youtube are not mentally refreshing and leave me just as if not more drained after). The danger is in letting yourself slip. It's a very quick slope and brain chemicals are usually stronger than our willpower. Even knowing how much better life is during these periods, I'm still currently in a down cycle because I'm struggling to find the energy to make the right choices. Work can also be draining which takes away good choice energy later in the evening. reply",

It's very customizeable, so you can choose what to hide. Create a list of what you want to be doing and consider attaching it to your monitor or putting it just to the side so that you can easily look at it. When you feel stuck, look at this list and do something on the list. Ensure the list includes some easy to do things on it like maybe \"go for a walk\", \"read a book\", \"play instrument\" etc. When trying to change habits, start off small and simple. For example, if you want to start running each day you might start by putting on your running shoes and walking to the end of the driveway and back. Start off so small that your brain can't talk you out of it. I create daily todo lists and feel satisfaction from checking them off. Try some ideas and see what works for you. Good luck! reply",

I combined this with the Distraction Free YouTube browser extension that worked really well — no recommendations would display on the home page or on an individual video page. So I'd only look at the videos that came through my RSS reader, and I'd see no other recommendations on YouTube — in and out. There are trade offs. I'd miss out on content that I'd probably be interested in. I trusted that if there was something interesting enough, a friend would tell me. The extension broke when YouTube started cracking down on ad blockers. I still get alerted to new videos in my RSS reader. Except now, I get sucked into recommended content sometimes when I watch a video. I think I just realized in typing this that I need to find another extension like DF YouTube. reply",

At a certain point you need to accept that you will not be able to willpower your way out of it. You need systems and strategies in place that cut you off from your addiction. That can look like a lot of things that I'm not going to try to stuff into an HN comment but here's what works for me: - Leaving the house with a dumb phone. I recommend using an old smartphone that is meticulously stripped away from bad things over purchasing a flip phone. You're eventually going to need to call up an uber, scan a QR code, and other such smartphoney things you need a dumb phone to do. Leaving your environment is also key. If you must, bring your actual phone with you, but fully powered off. - Using a feature on your phone to cut yourself off from YouTube on a scheduled basis. Most phones have something like this by default, but there are also some third party apps that take it a step further. - Have something you enjoy to take the place of YouTube. Entertainment is healthy to an extent. Taken too far, it becomes a distraction from cognitive processes you need to be regularly engaging in, to say the least. reply",

This will make the main page less of a candy store. uBlock origin can help hide Shorts and other annoyances.

This makes the video content you’ve subscribed for the main content.

It made you do a lot of things and achieve where you are, but it has too many CPU cycles in your brain for you to lead a (mental) healthy life. I know the feeling. It isn't about Youtube per-se, but the fact you do this and regret later, so yes, it is an addiction and bad for you. You likely have a lot of entangled thoughts about yourself, some which are indeed, yours and more of your nature, and also others that are not your own desires. If you didn't regret it and as you lead a normal life, it's alright. Why do you regret, is it because you ultimately would like to achieve something big or certain goal, or is it because you envy others sending rockets to space? Only a professional, a psychologist can help you to find this out. They can also help you to find ways of breaking apart those habits that take you in front of Youtube, and find new ideas or things you'd really like to do instead, even if they don't lead to immediate dopamine shots. reply",

I've experimented with having a non-logged in browser with recommendations but occasionally it manages to find my poison, so after I nuke the cookies it is back to intentional usage of YouTube there too. Because the worst part of the YouTube, it gives you useful stuff that improves your life, but it also just sucks you into a black hole of content. Also it is true that these things with procrastination and addictive behaviors are very much emotional issues and so on... and in my case whenever I notice that I'm avoiding dealing with my emotions and the hard stuff with YouTube content black holes I do the resets.

          "text": "$10/month for GitHub copilot, which apparently allows me to access ChatGPT5 when I'm in visual studio code on my windows pc. The agent way of doing code generation is light years ahead of the old way of trying to convey error messages back to the LLM manually. You tell ChatGPT5 what you want, it writes code and answers questions, then gives you command lines to try, and watches the output for errors, then fixes them, and has you try again, until it works. Awesome stuff, affordably priced, even for a retired dude like me. You do have to watch out, though... ChatGPT5 is a way better Python programmer than I am, it spit out code in a few minutes that I'm still trying to figure out.[1] (line 245, decompile_lut_to_expr(lut: int) -> str) It's going to take me another day or two to fully grok the Quine–McCluskey algorithm, and the Möbius transform it uses to take a compiled expression of 4 variables, and regenerate the minimum expression necessary to create it.

When I need real horsepower (usually advanced math stuff) I use DeepSeek, which is both free and unparalleled in my opinion. I did some experiments with OpenRouter but my total usage is still below $10. More and more I've been experimenting with local thinking models and while it's quite slow (on my non-Apple, CPU-heavy hardware, at least), for some use cases it's an acceptable trade-off and the results have been satisfactory. I care a lot about data privacy and I'm just not gonna upload clients' proprietary codebases under NDA to some AI company. I've been considering buying or renting proper hardware for local inference but the TCO (particularly with regards to depreciation) is not intuitive. reply",

I was under the impression that most devs were disappointed in the result of bootcamps. And there are bootcamps that are simply scams. We do like open source, but the number of people working nights and weekends on it is quite small. You are just seeing the natural progression of knowledge. Standing on the shoulders of giants, etc. Back in the 90s, you could have a 7 figure ARR startup just by doing one basic CRUD app and putting it online. Now, people can do that as a learning exercise within a few days of starting learning how to code, and that was even before AI. The tools are better, libraries exist for most common needs, coding and DevOps practices have evolved, access to documentation and tutorials is incredible, and we are working at higher and higher levels of abstraction. It is not because we are glorifying mediocrity. On the contrary, we have spent decades striving quite hard to increase everyone's skills and communicate better ways of doing things. And we succeeded. If you can find any, go look at code and practices from the early 2000s and you will see just how much the general quality of work has increased. As a result of all the support from each other, more people can do the work now. Yes, it decreases salaries, but we've been living in an insane compensation bubble for a long time. reply",

The group with the highest rates of underperforming people I have encountered have been from contracting companies based in India. Even then, it's not super high in general but more how the company tended to switch from their A team players from initial on-boarding to their B team players for ongoing project work. The value/pay decline hasn't really happened yet. I think it might really happen in the nenxt few years. We are seeing higher unemployment but we are still seeing high pay for the remaining positions.

This means less qualified, skilled, experienced, or competent people can participate with near equivalent performance. The cost is a form of vendor lock-in and generally shitty output that costs more to build and maintain. In theory this also makes developers easier to replace because they are a cheap common commodity. In reality firing people requires legal safety, so it’s also more expensive than cheap conventions can allow. This is weird because wages are not declining. Businesses accept the rising wages in exchange for not having to pay for continuing education, licensing recertification, training, or other career maintenance. reply",

          "text": "> I have done math classes What classes? It's a bit hard to suggest what is appropriate without understanding where you currently are. > to brush up. But I think this might be the wrong approach. Especially for these topics. Instead of learning the minimum you need to just understand a specific algorithm, you should understand what the symbols mean, what they are doing, and how they are interacting with one another. Math is a language. But it is a language designed for precision. A big part of why I'm saying this is because at their core, these are not difficult equations from a computational perspective. You really just need to understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My point is that the hard part about math often isn't the calculation part. Let's take B-Splines for an example and look at what Wiki says > A B-spline is defined as a piecewise polynomial of order n, meaning a degree of n − 1. Either this is simple or incomprehensible, so let's break it down. What does piecewise mean? Here's an example piecewise function. a     if x > 0\n  f(x) = {0     x = 0\n          b     if x < 0 Given you're on HN and looking at computer graphics, I take it you're familiar with if statements? That's the same thing here. Let's translate. Looking at things from a different perspective can really help. if x > 0:\n    return a\n  else if x < 0:\n    return b\n  else: # x == 0\n    return 0 We should think of x as a location and we're just describing something about that location. Here's another piecewise function, but now in everyday English: \"Across the street all the houses end in even numbers, but on my side of the street all the houses are odd.\" There's always more ways to look at something. If you can't see what something means from this angle, try another. Be that another book teaching the same thing or another framework to describe the same thing. Get multiple perspectives. One will make more sense than another but which one that is tends to be personal. \"polynomial of order n\" A polynomial is an equation like a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n}. Sorry, let me rewrite that: a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n} Now in code for i in range(n):\n      sum += a[i] * math.pow(x, i) But we should break this down more, just like before. What is a_0? It is just a number. What does this represent? A point. What is a_1*x? That's a line. x is an arbitrary location. The a_1 is a scaling factor. So if a_1 is the number 2, then what our x is representing is all numbers (..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...} (is that all my neighbors across the street?) The a_2 x^2 is a curve, specifically a parabola. We can do the same thing. But also remember we're summing them together. So you have a point, a line, and a parabola. When you add them together you get something that is none of those things. What is really important here is that these functions you are interested in have a really critical property. They can be used to approximate almost anything. That almost part is really important, but you're going to have to dig deeper. My point here is that take time to slow down. Don't rush this stuff. I promise you that if you take time to slow down then the speed will come. But if you try to go too fast you'll just end up getting stuck. This is tricky stuff. When learning it doesn't always make a ton of sense and unfortunately(?) when you do understand it it is almost obvious. Think of the slowing down part like making a plan. In a short race you should just take off running without thinking. But if it is longer then you will go faster if you first plan and strategize. It is the same thing here and I promise you this isn't a short race. You don't win a marathon by winning a bunch of consecutive sprints. The only thing you win by trying that is a trip to the hospital. So slow down. Break problems apart. Find one part you think is confusing and focus on that. If it all seems confusing then try to walk through and force yourself to say why it is confusing. Keep doing this until you have something you understand. It is an iterative process. It'll feel slow, but I promise it pays dividends. Any complex problem can be broken down into a bunch of small problems[0] You got this! [0] This sentence doesn't just apply to how to figure things out, it applies directly to what you're trying to do and why you want these functions. If it doesn't make sense now, revisit, it will later. reply",

The teaching of mathematics has become so abstract that students are not taught how to map it to geometry which is THE way to build intuition.

While I'm a big fan of visualization I must also stress that it can equally be misleading. It's to make mistakes because you can only visualize anything above 3D like a blind man can describe an elephant[0]. It can be useful but it is also common to get caught up in one aspect while ignoring the rest. The trouble is you're not ignoring because you're rejecting what's there, you're ignoring because you can't see it and it is really hard to see it. I also think there's this misnomer of being good at geometry or good at algebra. I lied about math being a language. It is a family of languages. It's good to be able to speak several of these languages, just like it is beneficial to be able to program in multiple languages. The best language is only the best one in a certain context, but technically any of them will work. That's why I suggest multiple perspectives. I'll even say that programming is one of those math languages ;) [0] https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F... reply",

          "text": "I highly encourage you to talk to a mathematician about this stuff. In high dimensions everything is all about caveats and edge cases. Your {1,2,3}D intuition leads you astray rather than helps you closer to the answer. In fact, math is specifically an overly pedantic because nuances are so critical. I'll use an example that we can reason from low dimensions but that many people make the wrong connections. What is the probability that in N dimensions two i.i.d randomly drawn vectors are orthogonal? We can easily intuit in low dimensions that this is a pretty unlikely event. But in high dimensions exactly the opposite is true. An easy mistake to make is to not think about this question from a continuous perspective, by reframing the question to ask what the probability that the angle between to i.i.d drawn vectors are within some epsilon bound. If we don't, then the answer is trivial in all cases: 0. A good student would be able to reason through this from looking at the 2D case and 3D case but this is only a sample of 2 and it would be naive to generalize such a notion without doing the proof. So let's look at something a little harder. A classic problem is looking at the volume of a n-ball. Our 2D and 3D understanding make this problem look easy. The volume of the 3D ball is much larger than the 2D ball. We can even verify this my analytically solving the 4D case. Same with the 5D case! But that's when things go awry. For the unit n-ball, 5D is where the maximum volume is. By 10 dimensions you have less volume than our 2D case and by 20 dimensions your volume is quickly converging to 0. Now let's look at something wild. Consider a hypersphere with radius r inscribed within a hypercube with sides of length 2r, what proportion of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube for a given dimension D? This sounds like an absolutely dumb question if we use or 2D and 3D logic. What amount of the sphere is inside the cube? 100%! It's right there in the problem description! Right? But this is entirely wrong. As dimensionality increases, very quickly, ~0% of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube and this is all due to the fact that hypercubes and hyperspheres have very different representations in high dimensions. Yes, there is still visual understanding we can draw to help reason, but again, this requires us to look at the problem from a different vantage point (the key thing I stressed in my original post btw). We have to look at the dual of the problem and instead ask \"what is the ratio of the volume of a hypersphere to the volume of the hypercube it is inscribed within?\" This will help but there's also a reason I put this question after the previous one because we know that there is not a clean linear relationship here and that at least with the sphere the volume increases and then decreases. Our visual intuition only helps if we can recognize that the relationship has everything to do with the corners of the cube. It is easy to look at these 3 cases and see how visual intuition from low dimensions can help, but be careful about post hoc trivialization. It's easy when you know these things and after they have been told to you but they are not so clear when you're being presented with the problem. All 3 of these problems are deeply related to the nearest neighbor problem and the concentration of measure. Where we run into the problem that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish the nearest point to the furthest point. Leveraging our lower dimensional visualization can provide help but it is important to remember that they are a small part of the much larger story here. Which of course should make sense because as the dimensionality grows our 2D/3D slices of those are a smaller and smaller portion. This is why I referenced the blind man and the elephant. Not because you can't use visualization to aid you, but because to see the elephant there you have to sample that elephant at many different places. And just like the blind man, you don't know how big that elephant is and where things are changing. But this stuff isn't going to help with even more abstract concepts. Like how there is no division algebra in 3D and how the largest is represented via the Octonion. How by moving to quaternions we lose commutativity and how moving to octonions we lose associativity. These are very fundamental features of math that we are losing while moving to higher dimensions. So I'm not sure why you're pointing to Farin and Hansford's book. Their highly concentrated on low dimensions and only briefly discuss generalization at the very end. They miss many important concepts. Not because the book is poorly written but because they are far out of scope from what is being taught. My caution about high dimensional spaces does not mean I don't absolutely love Needham's books on Visual Differential Geometry and Forums or his book Visual Complex Analysis or even Carter's inspired Visual Group Theory. These are masterpieces and books I highly recommend. But it is about what is being communicated. We work frequently in lower dimensions and there is a wealth of information there. But this does not mean higher dimensions are not absolutely littered with pitfalls and paradoxes. The true study of high dimensional spaces is relatively new and drove people like Cantor and Boltzmann insane. Every small mistake that is easy to make in low dimensions becomes exponentially more important in high dimensions. Yes, there are dimensional reduction techniques and these help with varying degrees (utility being critically dependent upon the latent dimensionality of the data) but every single one of these comes with major concessions. There is often even very bad science performed due to this lack of understanding. Techniques like t-SNE and UMAP are routinely unknowingly abused to draw inaccurate conclusions about these spaces, as it is possible to perform nearly any clustering you wish (see Lior Pachter's Picasso). Even PCA is frequently abused in this area due to there being subtle assumptions being invalid on different problems. My point is: you absolutely should warn people that there are many pitfalls when dealing with high dimensions. Anyone brushing these differences off as inconsequential nuances is just ignorant of this rich space. I don't blame anyone for being unaware of these things because it requires some very complex mathematics to truly understand, and we're talking about math that the average scientist is never going to be introduced to. You likely won't even see this in a given science PhD. Not because it doesn't matter, but because it is just very difficult math. And we learn math through a game of telephone that is often hyper focused (not a great way to learn it tbh) reply",

          "text": "I am not sure what you are trying to argue with this gish gallop of a comment filled with strawmen. The usefulness of Geometry in visualizing and building intuition in Mathematics is a given. Equally, its limitations when it comes to higher dimensions is also known. But for a beginning student (the context of this thread) it is the former which must be emphasized before he has developed the requisite mathematical maturity to deal with the latter. You do not want to scare away students from the important practical subject of Linear Algebra by focusing too much on its complexity in the initial stages of learning. I highly recommend that you talk to/read the works of some mathematicians who are also involved with the research in the teaching of mathematics. There has been a lot of studies/research done on how to teach students build mathematical intuition using Geometry (and other graphical means) and in particular w.r.t. Linear Algebra. Some relevant references are given below for your edification; those by Harel are in particular, noteworthy. The farin and hansford book mentioned earlier is one of the best introductory texts for beginners since it starts with building geometrical intuition for the study of the linear algebra. Pair it with some more rigorous text like for example; Linear Algebra Pure & Applied by Edgar Goodaire and the student can comfortably learn a pure mathematical approach with a clear understanding of what he is doing. Goodaire is a \"pure mathematician\" who specifically starts with 2D/3D graphs and then transitions to n-space with all necessary definitions/theorems/proofs included in a very accessible writing style. This is the ideal approach to the teaching and learning of Linear Algebra i.e. use geometry (and other graphical means) in conjunction with algebra, and where applicable, include caveats/limitations, but always with the aim and focus of teaching concepts and not mere computation.

          "text": "It's a bit difficult to say, since some of those textbooks (e.g. Shirley) cover preliminary math topics as well. It sounds like you need to get a stronger understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and approach maths from a healthier viewpoint. Something like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right often forces people to treat linear algebra with the slow care it requires, but this may be a bit too extreme. Now that you have some applications in mind, write down all of the terms and concepts that are involved that you don't understand. Go back to a first-year textbook, something like Stewart's Calculus is probably ideal since it is designed to work up to e.g. Bezier curves. However, this time, I would not suggest relying on the exercises for understanding. Instead, place strong emphasis on the definitions and theorems, drawing them together into a diagram with the terms from earlier to really understand why each concept is required for another concept. Your objective should be to see how these ideas lead to the definition of those curves, and why it has to be that way. Be skeptical and try thinking of alternatives; you might find them to have issues, or coincide with what has already been found! Make sure you understand each concept first before you apply it; this will not be a fast process, and if you need to check something, be sure to do it. But thinking in the context of what you want to learn later is often helpful, I find. There are other, more detailed guides out there, mostly geared toward higher level math, e.g. https://www.susanrigetti.com/math and you might find the early parts of these useful too. Also, I have found chatbots to be reasonable at giving tailored explanations for a given topic, so there is rarely harm in using them to supplement your learning.

          "text": "It sounds like you've got something specific in mind when you say, \"modeling\". The term modeling is used in a lot of different situations to mean different things. For example, it could mean to make a 3d model in Blender, it could mean to pose for someone to paint you or to take a photo, with databases it's used to mean modeling the data, with statistics it's used to mean finding a way to simply represent and reason about the data (create a model of it). The things you've listed out make me guess you want to write 2d or 3d image rendering software. Is that right? If that's the case, there's no substitute for trying to recreate certain algorithms or curves using a language or tool that you're comfortable with. It'll help you build an intuition about how the mathematical object behaves and what problems it solves (and doesn't). All of these approaches were created to solve problems, understanding the theory of it doesn't quite get you there. If you don't have a good place to try out functions, I recommend https://thebookofshaders.com/05/ , https://www.desmos.com/calculator , or https://www.geogebra.org/calculator . A good place to start is linear interpolation (lerp). It seems dead simple, but it's used extensively to blend two things together (say positions or colors) and the other things you listed are mostly fancier things built on top of linear interpolation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation For bezier curves and surfaces here are some links I've collected over the years: https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/ https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.... http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=730 https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/drawings.html https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatt... A final note: a lot of graphics math involves algebra. Algebra can be fun, but it also can be frustrating and tedious, particularly when you're working through something large and make a silly mistake and the result doesn't work. I suggest using sympy to rearrange equations or do substitutions and so on. It can seem like overkill but as soon as you save a few hours debugging it's worth it. It also does differentiation and integration for you along with simplifying equations. https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/intro... reply",

          "text": "For geometry, start with high-school algebra and coordinate geometry, and learn how to put the two together: equations representing geometry. By which I mean, being able to write down equations for geometric objects and manipulate the equations to get them into different useful forms, and to compute useful things. A first example would be studying different ways of writing down equations for the line [1], and then learn how each of the forms relate, how to use algebra to move between them, and what each for is useful for. For example finding the intersection of two lines involves simultaneously solving for (x,y) that satisfy both equations, and there's a particular form that is best suited to that. Another form is better if you want to \"move along a line\" say, parameterised by time. One form might be best for GPU rendering. Once you're comfortable with algebraic expressions for lines, then you can move on to the more complex curves that you listed -- the equations for these curves can be manipulated in analogous ways. EDIT: importantly you want to learn not how to \"plug and chug\" numbers, but instead how to use these equations in code: e.g. how would you use the equations to write code to draw a line/curve, and how to derive functions to intersect curves, connect curves at tangents, etc. There's more to it than that of course. For example working out equations for tangents to curves will become important. But start with the above. You mention de casteljau algorithm, I am not familiar with that, but it looks like it might be heading more into algebra, in particular manipulating polynomials, which you learn to write down in high-school, study more in pre-calculus and calculus, but can get pretty complicated, for example if you want to solve a quintic equation. Two elementary books: McDougal, Little, \"Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge\" Joseph H. Kindle, \"Theory and Problems of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry (Shaum's outline)\" The following are approachable, but don't directly address your interest in curves: Joseph O'Rourke, \"Computational Geometry in C,\" second edition (basics everyone should know, starts with primitives like knowing the best way to compute the intersection of two line segments. Christer Ericson, \"Real-time collision detection\" (a bit more specific, but a fantastic book, recommended to me here on HN in the past) And of course I must reference Inigo Quilez' [2] \"SDF of a ...\" videos which give an illuminating perspective on using equations to describe geometry[3]. [1] https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/... [2] https://iquilezles.org/ [3] SDF of a Line https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMltMdi1Wzg EDIT: some of the IRC servers have #math channels, and some of those are open to drop ins asking questions like yours (others seem to be full of people studying for exams). reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

MeeGo proceeded far too slowly and Elop chose his former employers' Windows instead in 2011. Nokia's decline only increased and Intel hired many Nokia engineers. Soon Nokia made no phone anymore and Intel did not even manage to make their first mass-selling product. ARM-based SoCs were 10 years ahead in power saving.

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

Wrote a demo to select a song from a playlist with few thousand author-album-song with voice query. The WiFi add-on was a big plastic \"sleeve\", that the iPaq slid into, not the other way around.

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "The reason why I keep reposting this table is because people post incorrect statements about AMD/Apple so often, often with zero data backing. For Blender numbers, M4 Pro numbers came from Max Tech's review.[0] I don't remember where I got the Strix Halo numbers from. Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Having created Jedi in 2012, I started ZubanLS [0] in 2020 to advance Python tooling. My initial idea was to use a freemium model where companies would pay for usage on large codebases. That approach didn't work out with the arrival of Ty and Pyrefly. That said, most of the work on the tool is already complete:<p>- Full set of core LSP features (Diagnostics, Goto, Completions, Rename, etc.)\n- Type checking that's 20–200× faster than Mypy\n- Passes most of the official conformance tests [1] and over 95% of Mypy's relevant tests\n- Offers both a Mypy-compatible mode and a mode more similar to Pyright<p>Because of this, I'd like to open source the project. Ideally though, I'd still like to find a way to make at least a small living from it, so I'm considering different licensing options. Are there any licenses beyond MIT/GPL/AGPL that might make sense here? Personally, I'm leaning away from MIT since it leaves almost no room for monetization. Do you think that's a mistake? Right now I'm leaning toward AGPL. From your perspective as a user, would that be a blocker for adoption?<p>[0]: https://zubanls.com/\n[1]: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/python/typing/blob/main/conformance/results/results.html</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "MIT is great for fast adoption, but if you go that route, you’d need closed-source add-ons or a SaaS layer to monetize. Apache is also good for adoption and for getting corporate clients and sponsors, but the trade-off is that anyone can take your code and repackage it without contributing back. GPL or AGPL gives you more direct monetization options because it forces reciprocity. GPL protects against proprietary redistribution, while AGPL goes further by preventing companies from just hosting your project as a service without contributing. That makes AGPL especially useful for developer tools like LSPs, since it also sets you up for a dual-license model (AGPL for community use, commercial licenses for companies that want to integrate it into proprietary tooling). In short: MIT/Apache = growth and sponsorship potential, GPL/AGPL = stronger control and licensing revenue. It really depends on whether your priority is fast adoption or direct monetization. reply",

          "text": "It was originally designed to be used by government software in the EU. AFAIK, it doesn't really get used for much else, but it fills a niche not covered by the GPL family, which is weak/non-viral copyleft (as the LGPL provides), plus handling SaaS in a reasonable way (as the AGPL provides). Copyleft protects against proprietary forking, and also assures the community you can't close the source in the future. Weak/non-viral copyleft makes it so you can still link it to proprietary software, so you could sell integrations (non-LSP) or closed-source plugins. LGPL and GPL licensed software can be provided over a network with proprietary changes. The AGPL and EUPL both close that hole. Every change to the modules covered by the EUPL must be open sourced, even in that case. If your intention is to monetize the LSP itself, open source is probably not what you want. It's fundamental to open source that anyone can use it for any purpose, and also fork it. Permissive licenses like the MIT license allow relicensing to a proprietary license later (see Redis) but that causes problems with the community (see Redis), and is nearly guaranteed to cause a fork. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around. Or at least some virtual machine / runtime that could be ported to some new OS / platform. reply",

These plugins can then suck in data from external systems and CMDBs which is perfect for internal documentation. Mediawiki is designed for another use case and much more complicated. reply",

          "text": "I had wanted to use Gitbook for blog/wiki[0] but then discovered that it's not opensource anymore. After not finding anything for a long while finally found something close that will work for me: Docsify[1]. Docsify is git-backed but not a static site generator. Instead it reads the markdown as-is and renders to HTML/DOM (don't know the details) in the browser. I had 2 problems with it, first the sidebar wasn't convenient to edit/update, which I handled by creating a tags: `name` `name` annotation convention. The second was it didn't work for private github repos, which was solved by using Cloudflare Pages to auto-publish changes from git. Effectively now it has a 'build' step like a static-site-generator but it's only to write _sidebar.md from the tagged *.md files. You can see the start of my personal wiki/notes[2] which includes some info about Docsify and Cloudflare Pages & Access (transparently login-protect http paths) . Note the 'Edit' buttons (which open Github in edit mode) won't work (as you don't have access to private repo).

          "text": "I spent some time searching for a good wiki a few months ago. It depends on your use case. The simplest and oldest wiki might be Docuwiki. There is no database, and organization is based on text files in folders. You can make decent wikis with it, but it’s minimalist and can be hard for the users to use it. Then we have enterprise solutions for collaboration by Microsoft, Google, Atlassian, etc. They can’t be used in our workplace, due to organization policy. I went with Bookstack for a wiki to be used by a group of people. The interface and fonts are pretty, it’s super fast, installation is easy, and automatic updates have been problem free so far. The content must be organized in terms of shelves/books/chapters/pages, but some people want any number of categories and titles.\nIt doesn’t allow a lot of customization, but the choices made are OK. Mediawiki is complex, and takes more time to administer. It could make sense for large number of users. I stopped using it after upgrades broke the installation a few times, and, frankly, the interface looks outdated to me in most themes, and needs customization which takes time. Obviously, it’s very customizable, there are tons of resources and we know it can scale to billions of people! reply",

If a developer used to write 100 lines of code per day (illustrative) but now AI writes 90% of the code, so you'd think that the load will go down to 10 lines, right? What I find is that the scope has exploded. Developers are now able to crank 1000 lines per day total and while you may say that AI writes 90% of them we are still writing 100 lines of the hard stuff.<p>Every feature that seemed too expensive before is suddenly doable. Every prototype becomes production system. The bottleneck shifted from typing to thinking, but the thinking load just got 10x bigger. We have also single-handedly increased the demand of that 10% chunk which is not as easy to scale as machines.\nAm I the only one noticing this?</p></p></p></p></div>",

The code that even ChatGPT generates is usually just as well structured using good software practices as I would have done - and I’ve been in the field professionally since 1996. The only work I do manually is moving functions out into their own libraries and telling it to use my libraries to reduce duplicate code. It’s going to hurt junior devs the most.  I still have to do the higher level design work and tease out requirements. reply",

The role: We're looking to add a founding ML engineer to build out our data science practice (and ideally hire and lead a data science team). You would be our first ML hire and working alongside our data engineering and product teams to identify, scope, POC, and productionize relevant analytic use cases to help drive new and improved product offerings, and to elevate our client experience.  Our data eng stack is mostly Python + AWS, and you will have the resources and support to develop an ML stack alongside that. Generally, if you like working with data, tackling open-ended problems, and (optionally, but always nice) building cool products to help folks take a more active role in their investments --- you'll probably have a good time here! You can apply directly here: https://www.paycomonline.net/v4/ats/web.php/jobs/ViewJobDeta... If you'd like to learn more, drop me a line at c.wetherill [at] trustetc.com NOTE: Although the role is remote, we are only set up to hire out of certain states (generally the midwest, central, and southern US). Feel free to email me before applying and I can confirm if we're able to hire out of a specific state reply",

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

Our mission is to combat pervasive consumer distrust and inefficiencies by empowering homeowners with a transparent, high-fidelity, and interactive 3D solar design tool. We are a small, dedicated team working closely with an established industry partner for rapid, real-world testing and iteration. We are looking for a Senior 2D/3D Computer Vision Engineer to build the core technology that makes our platform possible. The central challenge is to automatically generate clean, geometrically accurate, and simplified 3D roof models from raw aerial Digital Surface Models (DSM) and RGB data. Your work will be the foundation of our user experience, replacing the opaque and slow manual processes that dominate the solar industry today. As the owner of this domain, you will ideally: • Define the Process: Take charge of the entire ML pipeline, from R&D to production. This includes refining the annotation process and enhancing our existing Three.js-based 3D annotation tool to build a high-quality, large-scale dataset. • Build the Models: Research, develop, and train a suite of models to handle roofprint segmentation, structured prediction of planar roof wireframes from point clouds, and detection/classification of roof obstructions (chimneys, pipes, windows, etc.). • Ship to Production: Engineer a scalable and robust inference pipeline that can process new properties on demand. Our stack is Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Rasterio/GDAL, and JavaScript/Three.js for the annotation tool. We are looking for a pragmatic and experienced engineer who loves tackling complex 3D vision problems. You should be comfortable with both 2D and 3D data (especially point clouds and geospatial imagery) and have a proven track record of delivering end-to-end ML solutions.

We had even been talking about the exact salary package and start date, decided to talk again in a couple of weeks about the specifics, but then I never heard back, despite reaching out to you again. It’s totally fine if plans change and you decide not to move forward with a candidate, but I think a short email isn’t too much to ask after spending multiple hours on the various interviews. That said, the interview process was otherwise pretty good and the work you’re doing sounds really interesting, so I would still encourage others to apply. Best of luck with Formal! reply",

For example, I've led the architecture and implementation of machine-learning pipelines, booking engines, ERP and CRM systems, internal enterprise tools, etc. Additionally, my experience with startups is a significant strength, as I approach every solution I build with the perspective of both users and stakeholders, not only the developer's. Highlights: - Built a real-time ML data annotation platform, directly contributing to the company's revenue, achieving twice as many annotated documents as in the legacy system that was used before. - Reduced heavy loads via carefully architected async pipelines, improving the performance and system resiliency. - Led development of a tour booking engine (React/Next/Django) from architecture to launch. - Comfortable mentoring, reviewing, and guiding teams while shipping clean, tested, and extendable code. I prefer contract-based, fully remote B2B roles.\nIf you need someone who can take ownership of architecture while executing hands-on, let's talk. reply",

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip - Community engagement platform for soccer fans. Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

That analysis mapped 110M+ semantic connections across 1.5M+ words. I've turned that data into a daily word game about pathfinding through the multidimensional universe of language. I transform complex systems into experiences users want to use, and bring 10 years of indie puzzle gaming insights to both gaming and non-gaming software: * Design onboarding where users learn by doing, revealing features as users are ready * Create products people use because they want to, not have to; make the 100th use as rewarding as the first * Build \"aha!\" experiences into routine workflows, and crafting features worth showing off (no forced virality) Track record of making complex systems intuitive: SpicyNodes (40M users), time.gov (2M monthly), medical AI for 1.5M patients. PI on $295K NSF SBIR. \nLed diverse teams up to 40 people - engineers, designers, artists, writers, operations - plus managed 200+ contractors. I excel at uniting creative and technical talent.

          "text": "Technically, self hosting small private chat servers would be the correct answer.  Even something as tiny, light-weight and simple as uMurmur running on ones router would suffice.   Unfortunately however that will only work for close friends willing to join it.  Others would need a strong incentive and that probably won't be a thing unless ChatControl leads to fines, cancelling people, cooperation from platforms such as Discord and Slack, transcriptions of private voice chats being taken out of context by AI and leading to jail time or even the inconvenience of people being perp walked out of their homes and places of work, mothers being arrested for sharing bath-time pictures of their kids leading to destruction of families, etc... All of this is moot however should client side scanning occur and then so much more can be taken out of context.  In that case people will need clients they fully control which excludes all manor of cell phones, Windows (recall), Mac (mediaanalysisd).  Given cell phones exacerbate spending from those with a lack of impulse control I will attract vitriol from all the greedy business people by saying this.  All the binaries and libraries required for client side scanning are already in place.  It's just a feature toggle controlled by the OS maintainers at this point.  One tiny OS update opens up a channel into everyone's world to be automatically interpreted by AI. If enough people switched to Linux I would expect some obfuscated daemon to be inserted into systemd that purports to protect something. reply",

          "text": "Hey, I hope this comment doesn't bring you down. You asked for feedback with the aim of doing better -- I'm not going to pull my punches. In my opinion, your game isn't performing well because the gameplay isn't very compelling. In best combo mode, I can see a grid of arrows, I'm informed that clicking one of these arrows will clear more than the others. It says that I should find \"creative ways\" to clear the grid. I'm not sure that such a thing is possible. At worst, this is a game of guess the 1/25 arrow to click. At best, it's a game of tracking backwards through the arrows. As somebody who enjoys puzzle games, I don't personally find this a fun mechanic. My initial thought was that the art might be the problem. That perhaps if these were frogs that ate each other in order or if these were bubbles that popped in a satisfying way, this might be more enjoyable, but if you haven't got compelling gameplay, dressing it up isn't going to help. My recommendation is to focus on creating challenging and enjoyable gameplay first. Perhaps play some other puzzle games and ask yourself what it is you're enjoying about them. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>I have a largish (2 GB) corpus of curated, high-quality text in some low-resource language, and I want to build a model that would provide an advanced \"auto complete\" service for writers.<p>I'm thinking of taking a decoder-only model such as Llama, Mistral or Gemma, slice off the embedding layers (which are based on unneeded languages), create new ones (perhaps initialized based on a FastText model trained on the corpus), paired with a tokenizer newly created from my corpus, then train the model on my corpus until convergence.<p>Additional potential details include: a custom loss function for synonym-aware training (based on a custom high-quality thesaurus), where synonyms of the \"correct\" word are somewhat rewarded; POS-tagging the corpus with a Language-specific POS-tagger, and add a POS-tagging head to the model as a Multi-task Learning, to force grammatical generation.<p>In order to be able to use a good model as the base, I will probably be forced to use PEFT (LoRA). My current setup is whatever is available on Colab Pro+, so I can probably use the 7b-12b range of models?<p>My main question is, which base model would be best for this task? (Again, for completion of general writing of all kinds, not programming or advanced reasoning).<p>Also, will the synonym and POS additions help or hurt?<p>Anything else I might be missing?<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "My day job involves training language models (mostly seq2seq) for low-resource languages (with substantially less data than 2GB of data). A few thoughts: 1. You can't cut off the embedding layer or discard the tokenizer without throwing out the model you're starting with. The attention matrices are applied to and trained with the token embedding layer. 2. Basically the same thing regarding the tokenizer. If you need to add some tokens, that can be done (or you can repurpose existing tokens) if your script is unique (a problem I face periodically). But if you are initializing weights for new tokens, that means those tokens are untrained. So if you do that for all your data, you're training a new model. 3. The Gemma model series sounds like a good fit for your use case. I'm not confident about Hebrew support, let alone Hasidic Yiddish, but it is relatively multilingual (more so than many other open models). Being multilingual means that the odds are greater than they have tokens relevant to your corpus that have been trained towards an optimal point for your dataset. 4. If you can generate synthetic data with synonyms or POS tags, then great. But this is a language model, so you need to think how you can usefully teach it natural sequences of text (not how to tag nouns or identify synonyms - I also did a bunch of classic NLP, and it's depressing how irrelevant all that work is these days). I suspect that repurposing this data will not be worth it. So, if anything, I'd recommend doing that as a second pass. 5. Take a look at unsloth notebooks for training a gemma3 model and load up your data. I reckon it'll surprise you how effective these models are... reply",

          "text": "Yeah... I'm far from an expert on state-of-the-art ML, but it feels like a new embedding would invalidate any of the layers you keep. Taking off a late layer makes sense to me, like in cases where you want to use an LLM with a different kind of output head for scoring or something like that, because the basic \"understanding\" layers are still happening in the same numerical space - they're still producing the same \"concepts\", that are just used in a different way, like applying a different algorithm to the same data structure. But if you have a brand new embedding, then you're taking the bottom layer off. Everything else is based on those dimensions. I suppose it's possible that this \"just works\", in that there's enough language-agnostic structure in the intermediate layers that the model can sort of self-heal over the initial embeddings... but that intuitively seems kind of incredible to me. A transformation over vectors from a completely different basis space feels vanishingly unlikely to do anything useful. And doubly so given that we're talking about a low-resource language, which might be more likely to have unusual grammatical or linguistic quirks which self-attention may not know how to handle. reply",

It isn’t that surprising when you remember all these archive digitization projects that took place in the early 00s, but ended up either as stale links, preserved only by archive.org, or stored in arcane CRMs essentially unusable by humans.

          "text": "Don't fuck with the architecture for no reason. Just fucking don't. If you really, really want to, ALWAYS have a baseline of \"the architecture was not fucked with\" with otherwise similar training at hand, so you can compare. You'll see why. The purpose of using a base model in the first place is to be able to reuse existing learned representations so the model only has to learn the specific task. You propose starting the run off by kicking the base model in the balls and forcing it to relearn a lot of the things that lie at its foundation. While not even doing a full fine tune. And with a dataset that's VERY small for a heavy duty tuning run. I'm not saying it can't work - but I am saying that you'll suffer trying to make it work. Anything fancy you try during the training? Less of a minefield, but, again: keep a baseline to compare things to. 9 out of 10 fancy training ideas fail to outperform the baseline. And quite a few of those 9 underperform the baseline noticeably. For my first run, I'd maybe implement known-good basics like curriculum learning if possible but nothing fancier than that. \"Softened targets\" with semantic similarity off a dictionary might work to improve sample efficiency early into the run, but it's the kind of thing that might hobble your performance further into the run because your dictionary assumptions are worse than what the model could learn on its own, so taper this off at least? POS-tagging might improve things, in a similar way, but only if you find a decent way to feed the known-good tags into the model, which may be as simple as \"put the tags in the square bracket after the words with a \"this is a POS-tagged text\" next to the text, then mask\". The \"extra POS head\" may work but it might be harder to make that work than to rotate the tags into the corpus naively? Keep in mind that those are suggestions I make based on VIBES ONLY, and the only way to know if those vibes are on point or wildly off base is to actually try those runs, because that's how applied ML is. So if you want to get fancy, start off with a small model that's cheap and fast to tune, make sure you can validate performance at least somewhat, and be ready to experiment with your runs a lot. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s). - First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship. - Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer. Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups. Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator ( https://github.com/OperatorFoundation ). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case. In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols. - The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term. I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space). reply",

Even if you can't broadcast from inside a territory you can broadcast from outside. It can be jammed but it is a tough cat and mouse game and jamming isn't precise. So when you jam there are causalities. Not to mention that jamming can be quite expensive. I'm not saying that makes the problem easy, but I'll say that jamming isn't a very strong defense. Though the bigger issue here is probably bandwith. It's hard to be both long range and data dense. There's probably easier ways to distribute this. Hell, both Koreas are known to transport different things via balloons. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia [1] It is also why projects like Tor and Signal get funding from RFA. Maybe the US doesn't want encrypted services here, but if anything, it's for the same reason they do want encrypted services in other countries. reply",

I understand the confusion though, this phrasing could be better. > your government can decide to block unknown protocols This does happen, though when I worked in the industry it wasn't common. Blocking of specific protocols was much more of an obstacle. > you should trick DPI into thinking it sees HTTPS. Unless your government decides to block HTTPS HTTPS blocking (typically based on either the presence of a specific SNI field value, or based on the use of the ESNI/ECH TLS extension) was prolific. I won't comment on whether this was effective or not in impeding efforts to get people in these places connected. I will say though, Operator's Replicant does something similar to what you're describing in that it can mimic unrelated protocols. It's a clever approach, unfortunately it was a bit immature when I was working in that area so the team didn't adopt it while I was around. reply",

Predictably this means there's no one-size-fits-all solution to circumventing censorship on the Chinese internet, and research into this area's difficult since China has both the technical means to identify violations very efficiently as well as the bureaucratic infrastructure to carry out enforcement actions against a considerable portion of those people who violate the GFW rules (with enforcement action being anything from a \"cooldown period\" on your internet connection where you can't make any connections for some amount of time between minutes and days, fines, or imprisonment depending on the type of content you were trying to access).

          "text": "I just spent 3 months in China this summer. The GFW has become much more sophisticated than I remember. I found only one method that reliably worked. That was to use Holafly (an international eSIM provider) and use its built-in VPN. China largely doesn’t care if foreigners get around the GFW, I guess. Another method that usually worked was ProtonVPN with protocol set to Wireguard. Not sure why this worked, it’s definitely a lot more detectable than other methods I tried. But as long as I rotated which US server I used every few days, this worked fine. No luck with shadowsocks, ProtonVPN “stealth” mode, Outline+Digital Ocean, or even Jump / Remote Desktop. Jump worked the longest at several hours before it became unbearably slow, I’m still not sure if I was actually throttled or my home computer started misbehaving. I didn’t get around to setting up a pure TLS proxy, or proxying traffic through a domain that serves “legitimate” traffic, so no idea if that still works. reply",

It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself. A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now. In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

Intel and AMD were more desktop based so power efficiency wasnt the goal. When Apple's chips got so good they could transition into laptops, x86 wasn't in the same ballpark. Also the iPhone is the most lucrative product of all time (I think) and Apple poured a tonne of that money into R&D and taking the top engineers from Intel, AMD, and ARM, building one of the best silicon teams. reply",

MeeGo proceeded far too slowly and Elop chose his former employers' Windows instead in 2011. Nokia's decline only increased and Intel hired many Nokia engineers. Soon Nokia made no phone anymore and Intel did not even manage to make their first mass-selling product. ARM-based SoCs were 10 years ahead in power saving. The ARM ecosystem did not make any fatal mistakes, Intel never caught up. reply",

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

That makes its CPU cores a fair bit less efficient that AMDs even on the same production node. If Apple Silicon didn't exist then you might instead argue that x86-64 is more efficient than ARM. If all that's true then why does Snapdragon have better battery life? As I said in my comment the great battery life comes from when the CPU isn't being used. It's everything else around it.

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "The reason why I keep reposting this table is because people post incorrect statements about AMD/Apple so often, often with zero data backing. For Blender numbers, M4 Pro numbers came from Max Tech's review.[0] I don't remember where I got the Strix Halo numbers from. Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

You might feel trapped, so you pass the time with stuff like YouTube because that is the most compelling thing available to you.  A man will walk on broken glass with a smile if he truly believes in what it will accomplish. When I was younger, I was into video games because they gave me a sense of accomplishment and progress compared to high school, which I found relatively meaningless.  I called it progress quest. When there is a rare game or youtube topic that really obsessively catches your attention, like Factorio, pay attention to it!  It helps show you what drives you, and you can try to leverage that into things you find healthier. Also, it might be worth it to look into ADHD testing if this has been a persistent pattern your entire life. reply",

          "text": "When I was doing a similar schedule, it was a failure of introspection, and a mounting number of unprocessed emotional issues, and unconfronted personal problems. The way I got over it is that I have started realizing, confronting, communicating these issues. I \"sat down with myself\" daily just to think for 15 minutes, without any distraction like youtube. Communicated what I though were my problems to my partner, friends, parents, therapist, forums, LLM. Over time, patterns emerged, either by others pointing them out to me, or them occurring to myself. The patterns became higher and higher level, and I had more and more power and agency to fill in my gaps, and those in turn made my problems smaller, manageable. Challenges, even. I also picked up hobbies that nurture the specific parts that I was lacking. For example, I had a very hard time to persistently care about living things. But after a leap of faith I successfully kept a plant alive, and I slowly build a hobby around this. Funnily enough, youtube helped in this, because I also shaped that so that the helpful videos remained. While doing chores, self-care and other such things, I listened to a lot of mental health, lifestyle, introspective, hobby content, and these were wonderful sources of inspiration. In a way, having a bluetooth headphone also helped a lot. It helped to bridge the gap between the digital world, which was my only comfort zone, and the \"irl\", which was like the cold, hard, overwhelming rest of the world that I didn't really want to deal with. reply",

Thus I can do what I actually like, and the problem is solved. I am cautious if anybody uses the word \"healthy\" outside of the context of actual diseases like pleurisy and conjunctivitis. I am aware of a below-the-radar societal battle over way of life, and proper conduct, and the battleground is haunted by specters of ideas like sin and saintliness. It's these fraught issues that cause \"media addictions\". The nature of the \"addiction\" is doubt and unhappiness over the thing you want to do, where the saintly walking-over-broken-glass things you imagine you ought to want are set against a reactionary avoidance of them, and the meaning of \"want\" is lost in the turmoil. I haven't watched Youtube for ten years, but I will do other unproductive things \"endlessly\". (If anybody cares, I can report that the Backrooms mod on C:DDA has a layer of soil above the main level, and it's possible to break out into the open air and build a car up there. That's mostly what I did over the last two weeks.) I would like to be so firm in my convictions that I can say \"and I don't care\", but sadly I keep coming back to the idea that I should make some games, or write, or do art. Those are prestigious, pious things to do. It might turn out that my feelings are correct, and I might return to a project and complete it. But I might also be wrong about these self-aggrandizing ideas. I might keep coming back to appearing to be creative only as a kind of defense against appearing unworthy. I might actually idle my days away in a farty, unproductive manner unto death, and that might be what I should do. Whose moral standard is it here? Mine, yours, society's? \"Do what you like\", if you can wholeheartedly figure out what that means - that's the problem. reply",

Just like having junk food in the house means that I will tend to eat junk food (but I won't go buy junk food on impulse)... * Remove the time-wasting capabilities from your devices (e.g., uninstall apps, set up uBlock Origin blocking rules for anything TikTok-like, block HN for a week). * Make dedicated distraction devices hard to access (e.g., unplug gaming rig/console and store it away for a week/month, same with the living room TV/screen, sell that handheld gaming device). Also, once you get some momentum on a better activity, it's easier to stay doing it.  You might have to lock away all your distractions for a few days before you can get immersed in that coding side project (or writing that novella, or that new workout routine).  But then it can become a go-to activity that you do automatically, and maybe even think about at other times, rather than defaulting to doomscrolling. (I don't claim to always do this myself, but when I do, it works.) reply",

How I manage to actually get enough work done to keep my job is some kind of a miracle, I guess. I've long given up on personal projects or even anime and games. Everything requires too much energy that I don't seem to be able to find, so the comfort zone of YouTube or similar time wasters it is (browsing HN is my latest one, with all due respect to some of the really useful content on this website).

For some reason it's really difficult the first couple of times and then gets easier. Third step, once you're starting to feel like you've made it out, is understanding that there are circumstances out of your control that will lead you back into those old habits. Maybe work was draining or relationship problems hit - whatever it is, you'll feel like you deserve a break. You need to recognize those moments and have a plan ready for those moments. You absolutely deserve that break, but falling back into that habit is literally self-sabotage, and you'll feel worse after. Fourth step, rinse and repeat. I've never made it past this step. reply",

I wind up spending more time in conversation with my wife or my friends on those sofas, rather than \"Hey check out this video I saw..\". I've also replaced my phone with my watch for stuff involving unlocking car, and using a mostly-offline Linux handheld device with custom apps to replace stuff on my phone.

However, I suspect it won't. It never worked for me. Firstly, any blocker you setup yourself you can take down yourself.  You might find that it works for a day or two but then you feel really awful and binge youtube even more than normal. Secondly, blocking tools are a tacit acknowledgment that you have given up and can't control yourself. \"My willpower is just too bad. There's no way I can control myself. I need a tool to do it for me.\"  This is the opposite of the feeling your want to cultivate. You want to feel more in control of yourself and your actions and be able to direct your attention accordingly. Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets. There is no one little trick that will solve everything for you.  That said, there are things you can do that will help a lot. Get in touch with your emotions.  Find out what triggers send you to youtube.  Here's an example for me: Think about important essay that is due soon --> worry and dread about academic performance --> watch youtube to forget about it. This is probably happening in a blink of an eye. Probably so quickly that you don't even notice. If you can start noticing and naming your emotions you can deal with them more constructively. Positive emotions can be triggers too. I'm so excited about this new hobby I'm into --> I'm going to research it on youtube --> 3 hours watching videos about painting but not doing any painting. Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with this.  But if you can notice the emotions you can start to redirect them and work with them. reply",

Extremely locked down screen time rules are necessary - break the exciting loop of picking up your phone, eventually you'll re-associate the phone when each time you pick it up you're met with disappointment that nothing exciting is allowed. Life just slows down in a way that allows you to appreciate little things, make better decisions and treat people with more empathy, read more, reflect on life, get better sleep. ADHD is easier to manage. Less decision fatigue and general mental fatigue (I personally feel that scrolling/youtube are not mentally refreshing and leave me just as if not more drained after). The danger is in letting yourself slip. It's a very quick slope and brain chemicals are usually stronger than our willpower. Even knowing how much better life is during these periods, I'm still currently in a down cycle because I'm struggling to find the energy to make the right choices. Work can also be draining which takes away good choice energy later in the evening. reply",

Reading helps me start thinking and brings me a sense of calm. Also, here’s a small tip: I like to read the text out loud while reading. This makes it easier for me to get into the reading state (sometimes speaking the words is a way to let my inner self really “see” them).

At a certain point you need to accept that you will not be able to willpower your way out of it. You need systems and strategies in place that cut you off from your addiction. That can look like a lot of things that I'm not going to try to stuff into an HN comment but here's what works for me: - Leaving the house with a dumb phone. I recommend using an old smartphone that is meticulously stripped away from bad things over purchasing a flip phone. You're eventually going to need to call up an uber, scan a QR code, and other such smartphoney things you need a dumb phone to do. Leaving your environment is also key. If you must, bring your actual phone with you, but fully powered off. - Using a feature on your phone to cut yourself off from YouTube on a scheduled basis. Most phones have something like this by default, but there are also some third party apps that take it a step further. - Have something you enjoy to take the place of YouTube. Entertainment is healthy to an extent. Taken too far, it becomes a distraction from cognitive processes you need to be regularly engaging in, to say the least. reply",

I combined this with the Distraction Free YouTube browser extension that worked really well — no recommendations would display on the home page or on an individual video page. So I'd only look at the videos that came through my RSS reader, and I'd see no other recommendations on YouTube — in and out. There are trade offs. I'd miss out on content that I'd probably be interested in. I trusted that if there was something interesting enough, a friend would tell me. The extension broke when YouTube started cracking down on ad blockers. I still get alerted to new videos in my RSS reader. Except now, I get sucked into recommended content sometimes when I watch a video. I think I just realized in typing this that I need to find another extension like DF YouTube. reply",

It's very customizeable, so you can choose what to hide. Create a list of what you want to be doing and consider attaching it to your monitor or putting it just to the side so that you can easily look at it. When you feel stuck, look at this list and do something on the list. Ensure the list includes some easy to do things on it like maybe \"go for a walk\", \"read a book\", \"play instrument\" etc. When trying to change habits, start off small and simple. For example, if you want to start running each day you might start by putting on your running shoes and walking to the end of the driveway and back. Start off so small that your brain can't talk you out of it. I create daily todo lists and feel satisfaction from checking them off. Try some ideas and see what works for you. Good luck! reply",

Watch all other videos on incognito - I set up violentmonkey scripts to help. Here's a cool secret: your feed will ONLY be related to the videos in your history. My feed is now ONLY ML and music (3) Delete the app on the phone. Only use youtube through firefox (if you have android) which allows the ublock extension (4) Alternatives like newpipe helped before I stumbled onto this solution You still need a little willpower. Find the strength to not use youtube for 3 weeks. Then it becomes much easier Edit: clarity reply",

          "text": "> I have done math classes What classes? It's a bit hard to suggest what is appropriate without understanding where you currently are. > to brush up. But I think this might be the wrong approach. Especially for these topics. Instead of learning the minimum you need to just understand a specific algorithm, you should understand what the symbols mean, what they are doing, and how they are interacting with one another. Math is a language. But it is a language designed for precision. A big part of why I'm saying this is because at their core, these are not difficult equations from a computational perspective. You really just need to understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My point is that the hard part about math often isn't the calculation part. Let's take B-Splines for an example and look at what Wiki says > A B-spline is defined as a piecewise polynomial of order n, meaning a degree of n − 1. Either this is simple or incomprehensible, so let's break it down. What does piecewise mean? Here's an example piecewise function. a     if x > 0\n  f(x) = {0     x = 0\n          b     if x < 0 Given you're on HN and looking at computer graphics, I take it you're familiar with if statements? That's the same thing here. Let's translate. Looking at things from a different perspective can really help. if x > 0:\n    return a\n  else if x < 0:\n    return b\n  else: # x == 0\n    return 0 We should think of x as a location and we're just describing something about that location. Here's another piecewise function, but now in everyday English: \"Across the street all the houses end in even numbers, but on my side of the street all the houses are odd.\" There's always more ways to look at something. If you can't see what something means from this angle, try another. Be that another book teaching the same thing or another framework to describe the same thing. Get multiple perspectives. One will make more sense than another but which one that is tends to be personal. \"polynomial of order n\" A polynomial is an equation like a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n}. Sorry, let me rewrite that: a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n} Now in code for i in range(n):\n      sum += a[i] * math.pow(x, i) But we should break this down more, just like before. What is a_0? It is just a number. What does this represent? A point. What is a_1*x? That's a line. x is an arbitrary location. The a_1 is a scaling factor. So if a_1 is the number 2, then what our x is representing is all numbers (..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...} (is that all my neighbors across the street?) The a_2 x^2 is a curve, specifically a parabola. We can do the same thing. But also remember we're summing them together. So you have a point, a line, and a parabola. When you add them together you get something that is none of those things. What is really important here is that these functions you are interested in have a really critical property. They can be used to approximate almost anything. That almost part is really important, but you're going to have to dig deeper. My point here is that take time to slow down. Don't rush this stuff. I promise you that if you take time to slow down then the speed will come. But if you try to go too fast you'll just end up getting stuck. This is tricky stuff. When learning it doesn't always make a ton of sense and unfortunately(?) when you do understand it it is almost obvious. Think of the slowing down part like making a plan. In a short race you should just take off running without thinking. But if it is longer then you will go faster if you first plan and strategize. It is the same thing here and I promise you this isn't a short race. You don't win a marathon by winning a bunch of consecutive sprints. The only thing you win by trying that is a trip to the hospital. So slow down. Break problems apart. Find one part you think is confusing and focus on that. If it all seems confusing then try to walk through and force yourself to say why it is confusing. Keep doing this until you have something you understand. It is an iterative process. It'll feel slow, but I promise it pays dividends. Any complex problem can be broken down into a bunch of small problems[0] You got this! [0] This sentence doesn't just apply to how to figure things out, it applies directly to what you're trying to do and why you want these functions. If it doesn't make sense now, revisit, it will later. reply",

While I'm a big fan of visualization I must also stress that it can equally be misleading. It's to make mistakes because you can only visualize anything above 3D like a blind man can describe an elephant[0]. It can be useful but it is also common to get caught up in one aspect while ignoring the rest. The trouble is you're not ignoring because you're rejecting what's there, you're ignoring because you can't see it and it is really hard to see it. I also think there's this misnomer of being good at geometry or good at algebra. I lied about math being a language. It is a family of languages. It's good to be able to speak several of these languages, just like it is beneficial to be able to program in multiple languages. The best language is only the best one in a certain context, but technically any of them will work. That's why I suggest multiple perspectives. I'll even say that programming is one of those math languages ;) [0] https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F... reply",

          "text": "I highly encourage you to talk to a mathematician about this stuff. In high dimensions everything is all about caveats and edge cases. Your {1,2,3}D intuition leads you astray rather than helps you closer to the answer. In fact, math is specifically an overly pedantic because nuances are so critical. I'll use an example that we can reason from low dimensions but that many people make the wrong connections. What is the probability that in N dimensions two i.i.d randomly drawn vectors are orthogonal? We can easily intuit in low dimensions that this is a pretty unlikely event. But in high dimensions exactly the opposite is true. An easy mistake to make is to not think about this question from a continuous perspective, by reframing the question to ask what the probability that the angle between to i.i.d drawn vectors are within some epsilon bound. If we don't, then the answer is trivial in all cases: 0. A good student would be able to reason through this from looking at the 2D case and 3D case but this is only a sample of 2 and it would be naive to generalize such a notion without doing the proof. So let's look at something a little harder. A classic problem is looking at the volume of a n-ball. Our 2D and 3D understanding make this problem look easy. The volume of the 3D ball is much larger than the 2D ball. We can even verify this my analytically solving the 4D case. Same with the 5D case! But that's when things go awry. For the unit n-ball, 5D is where the maximum volume is. By 10 dimensions you have less volume than our 2D case and by 20 dimensions your volume is quickly converging to 0. Now let's look at something wild. Consider a hypersphere with radius r inscribed within a hypercube with sides of length 2r, what proportion of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube for a given dimension D? This sounds like an absolutely dumb question if we use or 2D and 3D logic. What amount of the sphere is inside the cube? 100%! It's right there in the problem description! Right? But this is entirely wrong. As dimensionality increases, very quickly, ~0% of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube and this is all due to the fact that hypercubes and hyperspheres have very different representations in high dimensions. Yes, there is still visual understanding we can draw to help reason, but again, this requires us to look at the problem from a different vantage point (the key thing I stressed in my original post btw). We have to look at the dual of the problem and instead ask \"what is the ratio of the volume of a hypersphere to the volume of the hypercube it is inscribed within?\" This will help but there's also a reason I put this question after the previous one because we know that there is not a clean linear relationship here and that at least with the sphere the volume increases and then decreases. Our visual intuition only helps if we can recognize that the relationship has everything to do with the corners of the cube. It is easy to look at these 3 cases and see how visual intuition from low dimensions can help, but be careful about post hoc trivialization. It's easy when you know these things and after they have been told to you but they are not so clear when you're being presented with the problem. All 3 of these problems are deeply related to the nearest neighbor problem and the concentration of measure. Where we run into the problem that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish the nearest point to the furthest point. Leveraging our lower dimensional visualization can provide help but it is important to remember that they are a small part of the much larger story here. Which of course should make sense because as the dimensionality grows our 2D/3D slices of those are a smaller and smaller portion. This is why I referenced the blind man and the elephant. Not because you can't use visualization to aid you, but because to see the elephant there you have to sample that elephant at many different places. And just like the blind man, you don't know how big that elephant is and where things are changing. But this stuff isn't going to help with even more abstract concepts. Like how there is no division algebra in 3D and how the largest is represented via the Octonion. How by moving to quaternions we lose commutativity and how moving to octonions we lose associativity. These are very fundamental features of math that we are losing while moving to higher dimensions. So I'm not sure why you're pointing to Farin and Hansford's book. Their highly concentrated on low dimensions and only briefly discuss generalization at the very end. They miss many important concepts. Not because the book is poorly written but because they are far out of scope from what is being taught. My caution about high dimensional spaces does not mean I don't absolutely love Needham's books on Visual Differential Geometry and Forums or his book Visual Complex Analysis or even Carter's inspired Visual Group Theory. These are masterpieces and books I highly recommend. But it is about what is being communicated. We work frequently in lower dimensions and there is a wealth of information there. But this does not mean higher dimensions are not absolutely littered with pitfalls and paradoxes. The true study of high dimensional spaces is relatively new and drove people like Cantor and Boltzmann insane. Every small mistake that is easy to make in low dimensions becomes exponentially more important in high dimensions. Yes, there are dimensional reduction techniques and these help with varying degrees (utility being critically dependent upon the latent dimensionality of the data) but every single one of these comes with major concessions. There is often even very bad science performed due to this lack of understanding. Techniques like t-SNE and UMAP are routinely unknowingly abused to draw inaccurate conclusions about these spaces, as it is possible to perform nearly any clustering you wish (see Lior Pachter's Picasso). Even PCA is frequently abused in this area due to there being subtle assumptions being invalid on different problems. My point is: you absolutely should warn people that there are many pitfalls when dealing with high dimensions. Anyone brushing these differences off as inconsequential nuances is just ignorant of this rich space. I don't blame anyone for being unaware of these things because it requires some very complex mathematics to truly understand, and we're talking about math that the average scientist is never going to be introduced to. You likely won't even see this in a given science PhD. Not because it doesn't matter, but because it is just very difficult math. And we learn math through a game of telephone that is often hyper focused (not a great way to learn it tbh) reply",

          "text": "I am not sure what you are trying to argue with this gish gallop of a comment filled with strawmen. The usefulness of Geometry in visualizing and building intuition in Mathematics is a given. Equally, its limitations when it comes to higher dimensions is also known. But for a beginning student (the context of this thread) it is the former which must be emphasized before he has developed the requisite mathematical maturity to deal with the latter. You do not want to scare away students from the important practical subject of Linear Algebra by focusing too much on its complexity in the initial stages of learning. I highly recommend that you talk to/read the works of some mathematicians who are also involved with the research in the teaching of mathematics. There has been a lot of studies/research done on how to teach students build mathematical intuition using Geometry (and other graphical means) and in particular w.r.t. Linear Algebra. Some relevant references are given below for your edification; those by Harel are in particular, noteworthy. The farin and hansford book mentioned earlier is one of the best introductory texts for beginners since it starts with building geometrical intuition for the study of the linear algebra. Pair it with some more rigorous text like for example; Linear Algebra Pure & Applied by Edgar Goodaire and the student can comfortably learn a pure mathematical approach with a clear understanding of what he is doing. Goodaire is a \"pure mathematician\" who specifically starts with 2D/3D graphs and then transitions to n-space with all necessary definitions/theorems/proofs included in a very accessible writing style. This is the ideal approach to the teaching and learning of Linear Algebra i.e. use geometry (and other graphical means) in conjunction with algebra, and where applicable, include caveats/limitations, but always with the aim and focus of teaching concepts and not mere computation.

          "text": "It's a bit difficult to say, since some of those textbooks (e.g. Shirley) cover preliminary math topics as well. It sounds like you need to get a stronger understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and approach maths from a healthier viewpoint. Something like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right often forces people to treat linear algebra with the slow care it requires, but this may be a bit too extreme. Now that you have some applications in mind, write down all of the terms and concepts that are involved that you don't understand. Go back to a first-year textbook, something like Stewart's Calculus is probably ideal since it is designed to work up to e.g. Bezier curves. However, this time, I would not suggest relying on the exercises for understanding. Instead, place strong emphasis on the definitions and theorems, drawing them together into a diagram with the terms from earlier to really understand why each concept is required for another concept. Your objective should be to see how these ideas lead to the definition of those curves, and why it has to be that way. Be skeptical and try thinking of alternatives; you might find them to have issues, or coincide with what has already been found! Make sure you understand each concept first before you apply it; this will not be a fast process, and if you need to check something, be sure to do it. But thinking in the context of what you want to learn later is often helpful, I find. There are other, more detailed guides out there, mostly geared toward higher level math, e.g. https://www.susanrigetti.com/math and you might find the early parts of these useful too. Also, I have found chatbots to be reasonable at giving tailored explanations for a given topic, so there is rarely harm in using them to supplement your learning. Just don't use them to solve problems for you. reply",

          "text": "It sounds like you've got something specific in mind when you say, \"modeling\". The term modeling is used in a lot of different situations to mean different things. For example, it could mean to make a 3d model in Blender, it could mean to pose for someone to paint you or to take a photo, with databases it's used to mean modeling the data, with statistics it's used to mean finding a way to simply represent and reason about the data (create a model of it). The things you've listed out make me guess you want to write 2d or 3d image rendering software. Is that right? If that's the case, there's no substitute for trying to recreate certain algorithms or curves using a language or tool that you're comfortable with. It'll help you build an intuition about how the mathematical object behaves and what problems it solves (and doesn't). All of these approaches were created to solve problems, understanding the theory of it doesn't quite get you there. If you don't have a good place to try out functions, I recommend https://thebookofshaders.com/05/ , https://www.desmos.com/calculator , or https://www.geogebra.org/calculator . A good place to start is linear interpolation (lerp). It seems dead simple, but it's used extensively to blend two things together (say positions or colors) and the other things you listed are mostly fancier things built on top of linear interpolation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation For bezier curves and surfaces here are some links I've collected over the years: https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/ https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.... http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=730 https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/drawings.html https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatt... A final note: a lot of graphics math involves algebra. Algebra can be fun, but it also can be frustrating and tedious, particularly when you're working through something large and make a silly mistake and the result doesn't work. I suggest using sympy to rearrange equations or do substitutions and so on. It can seem like overkill but as soon as you save a few hours debugging it's worth it. It also does differentiation and integration for you along with simplifying equations. https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/intro... reply",

          "text": "For geometry, start with high-school algebra and coordinate geometry, and learn how to put the two together: equations representing geometry. By which I mean, being able to write down equations for geometric objects and manipulate the equations to get them into different useful forms, and to compute useful things. A first example would be studying different ways of writing down equations for the line [1], and then learn how each of the forms relate, how to use algebra to move between them, and what each for is useful for. For example finding the intersection of two lines involves simultaneously solving for (x,y) that satisfy both equations, and there's a particular form that is best suited to that. Another form is better if you want to \"move along a line\" say, parameterised by time. One form might be best for GPU rendering. Once you're comfortable with algebraic expressions for lines, then you can move on to the more complex curves that you listed -- the equations for these curves can be manipulated in analogous ways. EDIT: importantly you want to learn not how to \"plug and chug\" numbers, but instead how to use these equations in code: e.g. how would you use the equations to write code to draw a line/curve, and how to derive functions to intersect curves, connect curves at tangents, etc. There's more to it than that of course. For example working out equations for tangents to curves will become important. But start with the above. You mention de casteljau algorithm, I am not familiar with that, but it looks like it might be heading more into algebra, in particular manipulating polynomials, which you learn to write down in high-school, study more in pre-calculus and calculus, but can get pretty complicated, for example if you want to solve a quintic equation. Two elementary books: McDougal, Little, \"Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge\" Joseph H. Kindle, \"Theory and Problems of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry (Shaum's outline)\" The following are approachable, but don't directly address your interest in curves: Joseph O'Rourke, \"Computational Geometry in C,\" second edition (basics everyone should know, starts with primitives like knowing the best way to compute the intersection of two line segments. Christer Ericson, \"Real-time collision detection\" (a bit more specific, but a fantastic book, recommended to me here on HN in the past) And of course I must reference Inigo Quilez' [2] \"SDF of a ...\" videos which give an illuminating perspective on using equations to describe geometry[3]. [1] https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/... [2] https://iquilezles.org/ [3] SDF of a Line https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMltMdi1Wzg EDIT: some of the IRC servers have #math channels, and some of those are open to drop ins asking questions like yours (others seem to be full of people studying for exams). reply",

          "text": "I gave a recommendation around LLM crossword generators a while ago, so reposting it: As someone who has dabbled in AI generated crosswords I found that providing samples of \"good crossword clues\" (which I curated from historical NYT monday puzzles) as part of the LLM context helped tremendously in generating better clues. Part of the deep satisfaction in solving a crossword puzzle is the specificity of the answer. It's far more gratifying to answer a question with something like \"Hawking\" then to answer with \"scientist\", or answering with \"mandelbrot\" versus \"shape\". So ideally, you want to lean towards \"specificity\" wherever possible, and use \"generics\" as filler. Producing a valid layout is a different situation. Ultimately depends on how strict you are in terms of acceptable layouts. Getting a NYT compatible crossword puzzle is going to be more difficult by virtue of its symmetrical requirements than if you're okay with just laying out sequences of perpendicular intersecting words. reply",

No big deal, I liked the work and the people I was working with, or so I thought. Three years later, I was laid off, and the technology I got the certification in is largely obsolete, or at least, difficult to break back into without experience in the new stuff. Meanwhile, the other company I got the offer from has not laid anyone off, and has seemingly migrated all their employees to different stacks. To rub salt in that wound, the former colleagues still work there. Lesson painfully learned: switch jobs when the opportunity presents itself.

It is a system of system that communicate via a CAN BUS, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus .  This is still true for electric cars.  Can this be hacked?  Like everything else, yes. Can you side load a new ROM like an android device?  Not that know of and hope that never becomes a reality because your phone crashing is different than you car crashing (figuratively and literally).  Can you enable/disable features?  Yes, usually through ECU hacking.  On my P3 Volvo, I bought a cheap stripped down Chinese clone of Volvo's diagnostic tool called DiCE.  Once the ECU is decrypted, which is done through brute force, you can use something like https://d5t5.com/article/vdash-volvo-diagnostic or P3Tool to change level settings like the theme of LED dash or engine tuning.

The industry broadly follows industry standards like ISO 26262 and the less universal 21448, but these don't have firm legal weight outside their status as standards of practice, nor do they preclude installing your own software.

While the current administration appears to have paused enforcement, their position for many years has been that running anything except factory approved firmware on an ECU or other emissions related computer constitutes a “defeat device” and is illegal for an on road vehicle subject to emissions controls. (Granted, in practice 99% of the reason anyone installs new firmware on their ECU, or switches to an aftermarket ECU, is for a “tune” that does affect emissions. I’m sure there is some edge case exception, but it’s very rare in on road engines.) The alternative, and there are a very few tunes that have done this, is to prove to regulators that the tune does not negatively affect emissions in any way. In practice this is done by getting a CARB exception since they’re the ones actually checking for tunes. reply",

NHTSA simply has the power to issue recalls (preventing further sales) if those vehicles don't comply with FMVSS. NHTSA also doesn't incorporate standards like the FDA does, so while they're aware of industry standards and employ a number of relevant experts for various purposes, you're under no obligation to follow them. Tesla is actually an example here. Their development processes don't follow ISO-26262 (the automotive equivalent of IEC-62304), though stating this properly would need a lot of asterisks I don't want to get into. The EU does both of these things for vehicles, though it's a bit more complicated than a flat approval or rejection and it's handled by a designated third party that also does medical device testing like TÜV SÜD. Other countries like the UK have a dedicated agency to handle type approvals. reply",

I think, it is unfortunately, but not exists official market of custom ROMs. For about custom ROMs, situation very much like custom ROMs for Canon camera - they don't implemented totally new features, but with hacker methods, unlocked some hidden features, already existing in hardware and software; also exist similarities with Smartphones custom ROMs - for many Smartphones only possible to reset firmware to something like \"very new device without traces of wearing\", plus some copies of features from same model but other region, or mods (unlock features). Significant difference of EVs, for them much more frequently used things like \"power or torque limited by software\", because to faster get certification, producer could limit torque to be equal to ICE original vehicle (usually, electric motor have much higher torque than ICE with comparable other parameters), and in such case don't need to much bother with certification, as in many countries such limited electrification come with very simplified procedure. Sure, could exist lot of hacks for entertainment system. And many hacks you could DIY with things like USB to CAN bus controller. What also interest, exists large market of totaled EVs in 3rd world countries, where in garages literally could refurbish Tesla from trash (suffered extreme collision after which owner decided to utilize machine, but some guys bought it as trash and resell to other country, and it got second life, and I hear many cases, when previous Tesla owners once began get messages from their account but from whole other country). But that's nearly all, except entertainment system, other parts of EV usually considered highly regulated, so you cannot account for much customization of them. And level of hacking is very much depend on brand - as I hear, for example, Daimler including in machines \"CAN bridges\" between entertainment system and ECU, and classic CAN connector could only see entertainment system messages, but access to ECU severe limited (cheaper brands usually don't use CAN bridges). And sure as with other embedded tech, with time more new designs use locked boot and signed blobs, so with 10 years old machine you will definitely get more access than with brand new. BTW Tesla is by definition special case, as their electronics could be from different manufacturer in each production batch, as this claimed as feature, because of which Tesla less suffered from covid related issues (when many electronics manufacturers severe drop supply). Sure, this mean, for other manufacturer could be other hack (and early batches hacked much deeper than more modern). reply",

          "text": "What recourse do consumers have if the software in a car is so faulty as to be dangerous? Our (brand new) car is the most dangerous vehicle I have ever driven by a large margin because the steering, brakes and accelerator spuriously override the driver in a way that could cause an accident every couple of hundred miles.  (It averages a spurious alarm or override every 10 miles or so, and flat out force departs a lane or accelerates at a person / car every few thousand). Most of these issues could probably be fixed with so-called “deletes” that rip out parts of the active driver assist system, but they aren’t available for this model, and frankly, I’d rather pay to watch it be crushed than mess with such stuff. reply",
