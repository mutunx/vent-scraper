          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

Simply drag a folder of \"disorganized\" videos onto ClipMommy, and ClipMommy organizes the videos into folders / subfolders, adding tags, based upon some special statements that you can make at either the start or the end of your video (think audio-based \"clapboard\").

          "text": "Repo: https://github.com/mochilang/mochi I'm building Mochi, a small programming language with a custom VM and a focus on querying structured data (CSV, JSON, and eventually graph) in a unified and lightweight way. It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

          "text": "Just built a last-mile logistics management solution to replace a SaaS solution for a delivery company I used to be involved with. Handles everything from real-time driver tracking, public order tracking links, finding suitable drivers for orders, batch push notifications for automatic order assignment, etc. Backend: Feathers.JS, Postgres + TimescaleDB & PostGIS, BullMQ, Valhalla (for multi-stop route optimization although most of our deliveries are on-demand) Frontend: SvelteKit Mobile App (Android only for now): React Native/Expo, Zustand, Expo push notifications, and two custom native modules for secure token storage and efficient real-time GPS tracking. The tracking was probably the toughest to get right to find the best balance between battery/data efficiency and more frequent updates. Been testing it for a couple weeks and as of last week, that company moved their operations over to it with 50+ drivers and thousands of orders processed through it so far (in a country with pretty unreliable connectivity/infrastructure). I built it initially as a favor but open to other applications for it. reply",

          "text": "Still working on:  an enclosure-compatible open-source version of the 2nd gen Nest thermostat. It reuses the enclosure, encoder ring, display, and mounts of the Nest but replaces the \"thinking\" part with an open-source PCB that can interact with Home Assistant. - The encoder ring which works like an LED mouse, but in reverse: Fully reverse-engineered and on its own demo PCB - The faceplate PCB, which does the actual control of the thermostat wires, has been laid out, but the first version missed a really-obvious problem involving the behavior on power-on with certain of the GPIO pins from the ESP32, so I've got rev 3 on order from the PCB manufacturer. Nest Thermostats of the 1st and 2nd generation will no longer be supported by Google starting October 25, 2025. You will still be able to access temperature, mode, schedules, and settings directly on the thermostat – and existing schedules should continue to work uninterrupted. However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist. It has been pretty-badly supported in Home Assistant for over a year anyway, missing important connected features. reply",

          "text": "This weekend, my modified Android/mobile Point of Sale (POS) app was used to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our village's volunteer firefighting organization. The standard fiscal POS app was adapted to support a sort of low-trust swarm of waiters who used the app to collect orders. These orders were then transferred to a few high-trust cashiers by scanning QR codes generated on the waiters' apps. After receiving payments, the cashiers' apps printed invoices and multiple \"order tickets\" categorized by \"food,\" \"drinks\", \"sweets\"... This allowed waiters to retrieve items and deliver them to customers. The system was used by around 40 users, with new waiters joining or leaving throughout the event. They used their own phones, and the app functioned without internet or Wi-Fi, gracefully downgraded (If a waiter didn't use the app due by choice or due to technical problems, they could manually relay orders to cashiers), Customers also had the option to approach cashiers directly, receive their order tickets, and pick up items themselves. This is not that technically interesting, but I liked how the old manual system, the 70+ year village firefighting org. main cashier had, got digitalized in non-centralized way. (and I took this chance in trying to explain it, as I will have to, to maybe find more users for it) reply",

It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files.

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

I've torn it down and rebuilt it a few times, I've got multiple branches of it that are built for specific things... but when I want to do something I know it can't do, that could be easily done in some other engine, it just puts a bug up my butt to try and make my own code do that thing. Then I dive into code I haven't looked at for a few years and I realize that so many things could be improved. And I lose a week of sleep yak-shaving this thing that will almost definitely never be seen or used by anybody else. But I see it as a kind of craftsmanship and sharpening my own tools.

          "text": "After 2+ years of maintaining the FOSS lightweight Reddit frontend Redlib [0], I realized that my niche but extremely detailed knowledge and experience of using Reddit's endpoints might be useful. After reverse engineering the mobile app and writing code to emulate nearly every aspect of its behavior, plus writing a codegen framework that will auto-update my code from analyzing the behavior from an Android emulator, I can pretty easily replay common user flows from any IP around the world, collecting and extracting the data. Some use cases: * OSINT (r00m101 just beat me to it by launching...) * Research into recommendation algorithms, advertising placement algorithms, etc * Marketing (ad libraries, detailed analysis of content given data not even exposed to the mobile app due to some interesting side channels, things like trend analysis, etc) * Market research for products * Sales teams can use it to find exact mentions of other products. Eg: selling crash reporting software? Look up your target accounts' brands and find examples of complaints. Plus a few more with more imagination. So I'm working on a site that allows user access to some of the read-only functions available here. Coming soon :tm:. Been really fun building it all in Rust, though :) If you're interested in anything here, email in profile. [0]: https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib reply",

( https://engage.myemmaai.com/ ) Most employee engagement software is just placation for HR. When it's common that the lowest scoring question on feedback cycles is \"I believe that action will be taken based on the results of this feedback,\" there's something fundamentally broken with how companies handle feedback, and how the tools their given enable them to react to it. Our end goal is to help leaders and managers identify problems with trust and communication within a team. The reality is, 90% of the time, the problem lies with the leadership itself. We're trying to provide both the tools to diagnose what the problems are, and frameworks for managers to fix them. reply",

It's an area with some heavyweight incumbents (e.g. Visio, Lucid) but I think there's good opportunity here to differentiate in simplicity and overall experience. I'm still in the fairly early phase, and I suspect I haven't quite found the best match of features to customers yet. From a dev perspective this area has a ton of super interesting algorithmic / math / data structure applications, and computational geometry has always been special to me.

Frankly, the biggest obstacle for desktop is not the app itself, but distribution and figuring out a pricing model.

This week, I'll set up a Hugo blog with the Ed theme, love it, looks exactly what I'm looking for, and as a former LaTeX enthusiast, it's pretty close. It's readable, minimalist. I'll need to customize the theme, though. I plan to publish blog posts about anything I find interesting. https://gohugo-theme-ed.netlify.app/ In parallel to this work, I'm setting up a simple system to keep my website + subdomains easy to build, rebuild, and deploy with Caddy on a cheap Scaleway compute server. In the past, I had some ideas I wanted to publish, but the system I went with made managing the sites dreadful. Once that's ready, I'm back to learning Rust and crypto. It's fun, interesting, challenging, remote-friendly, and the salaries are usually 30-50% better. My current tech stack feels like a dead end: it has a low ceiling in terms of salary, the projects are generally not very interesting (I'm grateful for my current project, it's the best there is with this technology), and I believe the technology will see a slow and steady decline. Apart from work, I'm building the playground for my 2 yo son, and planting blueberries, he loves them. reply",

I don't expect lot of traffic and I don't care if my stuff would go down from time to time, it's for fun. Set up SSH. Buy a domain, set up the DNS records to point to your instance. Run Caddy on the server to serve a dummy HTML file. Set up HTTPS. Verify you see your stuff in the browser. Now, create an actual site. Install hugo, pick a theme, install locally, build locally. Set up a script that copies the build folder onto your server where Caddy is serving, then restart Caddy. Write some content, check the limits of the theme / your set up, make sure everything works correctly. Even with the best of themes, you'll want to fix or change something, do that, if it looks good and you still have energy to work on your blog, start writing posts and let the world know. reply",

It's designed to handle computational, network, and temporal resources in fully distributed environments without central controllers, but that could also handle a centralized environment.\nRank implements four core functions: discovery (finding paths between nodes), estimation (evaluating resource availability), allocation (reserving resources), and sharing (allowing multiple services to use the same resources).\nWhat I think it makes it unique is its ability to operate in completely decentralized environments with heterogeneous nodes, making it particularly valuable for edge computing, cloud gaming, distributed content delivery, vehicular communications, and grid computing scenarios.\nThe protocol uses a bidding system where nodes evaluate their capability to fulfill resource requests on a scale from 0-1, enabling dynamic path selection based on current resource availability. I've implemented it in C++ and then also created a testing framework to validate its performance across different network topologies.

          "text": "It's just people following trends I think,  designers not knowing about WCAG, and designers with decent eyesight not knowing to consider people with poor eyesight. Someone sees some elegant looking site that has grey text and/or thin text, they copy it, someone else copies that etc. without really thinking about what it's going to be like to read a long article with that design. - From my experience working with designers, many have minimal understanding of WCAG and will only adjust the contrast near the end of the design phase (as in, after the client has signed-off on it) to get it within passing limits if they're told to, and only if it's easy to do without spoiling their design. - The rules for body text are pretty simple and I'm not excusing it, but WCAG is intimidating and confusing for most I think (ask designers why they don't follow it or understand it). There's loads of rules, the documentation is verbose, and it tells you what needs to pass, but lacks guidelines on how to do this in a way that doesn't change the look of your  branded designs. - I've been in this situation as a developer a few times where I'll tell the designer what specific WCAG rules aren't being followed, and they'll not change anything because they don't know what to do without compromising their design e.g. I'll mention \"your main brand color can be used for large heading text, but it doesn't contrast enough for buttons\", where the options might include picking a darker brand color (a big ask), a darker color just for buttons (might look weird), or maybe black for buttons (will change the look a lot). - It's really common for designers to pick bright/vibrant colors for the main brand color too that won't be accessible for body/button/link text, so being told they have to pick a darker color can feel like a big unfair restriction, especially when they see large brands or the designers they follow breaking the WCAG contrast rules all the time. Also, when most brand guidelines don't include contrast metrics for recommended color pairings, you can tell this hasn't been thought about much. To help with the above, I started working on a tool to create branded color palettes, with the idea that you pick the colors for your headings, buttons, body text etc. that  have accessible contrast upfront, rather than tweaking the contrast of these as an afterthought later: https://www.inclusivecolors.com/ reply",

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

In order to keep the hologram steady and anchored you need to perform a mapping process so that the helmet recognizes both the physical steel assembly and a bit of the surrounding area to keep it steady when moving around. The 8GB of RAM puts a limit on the amount of mapping data that can be stored putting a limit of the size of assembly you can work with, and since the mapping process relies on using the helmets own software that has not been work on in years it is extremely sensitive to any sort of background movement, which means it works best in as controlled of a environment as possible. Right now we are just using it for special projects that are complex and have little margin for error. We'd like to be able to use it for everything but that isn't feasible with where the tech is currently stuck at. reply",

A heads up display is just looking at the blueprint on a piece of paper with an additional layer of complexity, it wouldn't remove the need to manually measure, nor would it provide any assistance in spotting missing attached pieces (or some extra pieces). Once the model is overlayed QC goes from having to measure the placement of every pieces and the location of every hole to just walking around the finished assembly and ensuring that every conforms to the civil engineer approved model. A half hour process can be done faster and more precisely in 5 minutes, you notices very quickly when there is solid steel where the hologram has a hole, or thin air where the hologram shows that a plate was suppose to be welded on. reply",

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

The past decade of devices (hololens, realwear, google glass, vuzix, etc) were some combination of way too heavy, expensive, fragile, short battery life, no wifi connectivity, too much UI long to get to point of value and/or simply not useful. That and most customers had a content problem. The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. There was an instance where I asked techs why they weren't using the headset for showing what they were seeing in realtime and they said, it's easier to facetime (hard to argue that). The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works). There are training VR use cases (like learning to operate a crane), but once again it's a nice to have supplement and not a replacement. Recent advances with LLMs (specifically voice) + Meta type \"glasses form factor\" have created intrigue again with innovation centers at large companies. The use case we're currently working on is inspections or filling out forms with audio/videos. reply",

That's pretty interesting, do you even need a screen, or just voice? I would think a pretty quick-and-dirty way to do it is to take pdf forms, enumerate (put small numbers) next to every editable field, and then use voice commands like, \"write the following in field 3: ....\" The purpose of having a screen would be to verify what the LLM + voice is inputting in the form.

          "text": "For me the Vision Pro is my main machine now (supported by a MacBook Pro). And I absolutely love it. Which is saying something. My second most ergonomic situation is a 120\" screen with two 55\" screens tilting in from both sides (both in portrait, so all 3 screen verticals line up). All wall mounted. I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to. (Recommend expansion batteries that clip on the original, and round magnetic USB-C cable adapters, for more spontaneous mobility.) I like the standard Apple straps in a pinch. But my face needs a serious break from the weight they distribute on it, every 30-120 minutes. reply",

Also the field of view is too wide and so the edges are blurry (hard to see clock, corner buttons in fullscreen windows, health bar in video games, etc).

Tips: Get an upgraded headband, silicone face cover and carrying case. Use a physical USB connection for lower latency (& turn off the wifi/bluetooth as it's no longer needed). Bring a cloth for keeping the lenses clean. Bump the Retina quality up in the Immersed client (on Mac). Lower resolutions (1920x1080) are more comfortable to use over longer periods. Use a travel neck pillow for reclined usage. Bring replacement batteries and a charger for the controllers. reply",

It's not actually the weight. I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR head strap, external battery, etc that all add up to be heavier than the AVP, but I can easily go for multi-hour social sessions with that on without any physical discomfort. You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it. The closest thing I've seen to making it comfortable is the third-party ResMed Kontor headstrap, and that's being produced in such low numbers that it's functionally impossible to actually buy. reply",

I think the key issue is whether or not it adds enough value to justify buying everybody a headset, and for our use case I don't know if it does, though I'm just a lowly programmer, I don't know what the customers think about it. We have another product that's geared towards collaborating and sharing data between teams and vendors, and it seems better suited there, but that one is a web application, and I don't know how well VR glasses are supported there.

          "text": "The adoption of it in various industries for training is larger than most people might suspect. First responders and retailers have some of the largest internal deployments out there, but they aren’t massively publicized (most people would never guess who’s fielding the largest fleet of headsets right now). That said, it’s still not mass adoption. At the end of the day, you are asking someone to put something on their face that is still very different ergonomically than glasses (and I’m not sure even glasses would overcome enough friction). The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

          "text": "We’ve developed VR based industrial safety training, as a self-contained, portable product for blue collar workers in India - launched about 24 months ago with regular updates. Multiple companies have bought it, and we have large companies as clients who’ve used it to train 1000s of their blue-collar workers, even in sectors such as construction in a relatively challenging (in terms of pricing and value) market. We have a significant (I think!) number of devices deployed, and most of my clients end up purchasing more after the initial purchase and pilot. I think that’s for a few reasons: 1) VR, when well designed, can offer 1st person experience of being an accident victim due to the viewer’s own oversight / someone else’s oversight. That makes it a far more effective way to draw the learner’s attention to the importance of the safety protocols, etc. 2) Our solution is multi-lingual: it’s currently available in 10 regional Indian languages - that matters, since a significant fraction of the workforce may not understand English. Our localisation extends beyond that, but language is a big thing in enabling access and usage. 3) if you have to invest 10-15 min per learner (often one-on-one as the instructor) to onboard each learner before they can use your solution, it becomes very difficult to scale and raises the bar for cost-effectiveness. So that’s something we focus on heavily. 4) Setup time- don’t create a solution that requires IT support, someone who understands how to setup / load SteamVR / Oculus Link / meta Horizon. If the solution adds 20-30 min workload to the staff on a site, then adopting it becomes that much more painful - so we’ve worked very hard to develop an integrated system where the instructor can quickly onboard 10-15 learners and get going with the session in 5 min. 5) workflow changes: often, introducing VR means changing some part of the organisation’s workflow - many VR solutions don’t consider this / acknowledge this in their design- clients get initially excited, but when it comes to actually using it on a daily basis, the deployment and workflow frictions can completely tank VR adoption. I’ve seen multiple solutions fail because of this, and we focus extensively on this when we design our solutions. India is a hard market for VR, honestly because it’s very price sensitive. But I think we’ve made some progress here, because we’ve focused extensively on system robustness, ease of deployment, localization, and a lot of user-centered design. We’ve also developed sophisticated VR - based training solutions for SOP training. VR can be / is, very effective for initial onboarding and SOP training. Again, the challenge here is usability - most of the learner’s don’t know how to use the controllers. Learning how to use the controllers is not easy and takes time. So that onboarding is critical and needs to be done well. In SOP training, our experience is that it can, if designed well, significantly reduce on-boarding time; however, you still need the last 20% of training on the actual thing for it to stick, and for the learner to actually _learn_.

          "text": "AR is much harder as a solution to deploy at scale, I think. First off, most solutions work poorly out in day light - especially the bright Indian sun. So that automatically adds friction in terms of deployment opportunities / field deployment. The second issue is the limited FoV: 40-45 degrees. That's a pretty small display area to play with in terms of pushing detailed information, etc. Third, again, the usability, ruggedness and user-onboarding challenges. So, the use case has to be important enough and significant enough that the user / organization needs to accept all these frictions and still derive enough value out of the solution - that leaves very few use cases. Add to that, HoloLens is expensive, hasn’t seen any significant development in the past few years, and real wear type devices too aren’t cheap for large scale adoption - a smartphone / tablet in hand is often a better / more maintainable / cost effective solution even compared to real wear - I’ve seen clients securely mount a smartphone on their helmet and setup a teams call for remote viewing - it works! reply",

Some of the current customers might be able to use ANY distribution to patch problems for a while. Eventually, someone mightneed to decide on serious maintenance or not. But initially it quite possibly would not require much. When there are current users, the future may not be a thriving project but may be simply a patched up current solution. Nothing wrong with that. I suspect this is the case pretty often: a current solution is not great but it's in place. The code itself is nothing to write home about, but it's in place.

Curious if anyone here has used this yet I use the \"memory\" feature of ChatGPT, and taking a look right now, it seems to have about ~30 items saved from me, some of them are like \"Is using egui for a UI task, particularly related to configuring smooth automatic scrolling in a scrollarea.\" which is useful for maybe the ~3 chats I had about it, and also other things like \"Prefers more accuracy in terminology and is looking to represent LLMs in a detailed and structured way.\" that are more broadly applicable. Then you can obviously remove any of them, and also manually add by telling it explicitly you want something added. I'm not sure of its usefulness, I guess it's nice that it correctly \"knows\" I'm mostly on Arch Linux most of the time but have my servers with NixOS, so if I ask it to create new unix commands I usually get something that works on both, or two versions. But sometimes it also incorrectly infers something because I didn't specify otherwise in the prompt and didn't think of it, but it could see something from the memories. reply",

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | Remote Full-stack software engineer with machine learning skills. I have a decade of experience building successful products for early stage startups and larger organisations. Most of my experience has been developing new greenfield projects in contexts with significant uncertainty. I navigate this through careful consideration of stakeholder needs, business requirements, and an iterative approach. Beyond new projects, I have also worked extensively with a wide range of existing front-end and back-end systems. I get up to speed and can be effective quickly. I am familiar with cross-functional teams of 5-10 people in design, product, and engineering roles. Alongside this, I have experience working with smaller select teams tasked with building the technical foundation of a startup. I consider myself a “product engineer” in the sense that I focus on the product as a solution to end users’ problems, not a technical challenge. Over the years I have worked with many designers, user researchers, and user experience professionals who have shaped my attitude towards software. User experience is paramount to me and I can create effective user interfaces without aid of an existing design. My overall outlook is entrepreneurial and product-focused. I have a GitHub with open source projects that have thousands of active users, and the bulk of an MSc in artificial intelligence. Available for remote opportunities. I can accommodate flexible working patterns to suit different needs. I am also open to project-based work at a fixed price dependant on scope and complexity. What I do: - Lead greenfield projects, navigate ambiguity, and translate non-technical ideas into a technical product - Innovate solutions to hard problems with high complexity that touch on areas such as algorithms or system design - Design robust front-end and back-end systems, such as web apps with complex interfaces, or Serverless architectures - Implement supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised machine learning techniques. Including use of LLMs and associated tooling - Debug and fix bugs in existing software, including both front-end and back-end systems - Collaborate and work with teams on existing projects GitHub: https://github.com/andrewwalsh Portfolio, projects, and contact details: https://www.awalsh.io/projects reply",

This project has a lot of momentum behind it, particularly as recent political changes in the US are getting countries interested in the idea of digital sovereignty. Our partners have a combined regular audience that collectively includes a substantial fraction of the western world, so if we get the product to a good enough state that they can promote it aggressively, it has the potential to be one of the biggest and most important platforms in the world.

Come join us in taking Ride with GPS to the next level! We have two openings right now, and are starting to build out the hiring plan for a third: Senior Software Engineer - API & Product Development: We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to join our small and effective engineering team with a focus on supporting web and mobile app development using our APIs. The right candidate for this role brings extensive experience supporting modern product development, in collaboration with frontend and mobile developers, product management, and design. This requires excellent communication and collaboration skills, both on the engineering side, and from a product perspective. We use rails, but prior rails experience is not required. Details, and application process available here: https://ridewithgps.com/careers/2025-senior-software-enginee... Senior Software Engineer - API Development: We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to join our small and effective team with a focus on our APIs and supporting our platform at scale. This doesn't mean you are isolated from product development &emdash; everything we do serves our users in some way, and being a small team we regularly share responsibilities. However, this role will spend more time on efficiency and system design rather than delivering this quarter's new features. The right candidate should have a depth of experience supporting a large API surface area with efficient, well organized code, and should be excited about maintaining and improving performance over time. Experience with developer tooling, database design, query optimization, and DevOps workflows will serve you well in this role. We use rails, but prior rails experience is not required. Details, and application process available here: https://ridewithgps.com/careers/2025-senior-software-enginee... Senior Software Engineer - iOS Development: In mid July, we will officially start the hiring process for an iOS developer, and potentially another Android engineer. We are reviewing applications for qualified candidates at this time, and will officially post the job by July 15th. If you think you are an excellent fit please apply now, however there might be some delays in screening, interviewing, etc while we finalize our hiring plan. We have a technically interesting, battery efficient set of mobile apps that act as a companion to our website, and need another iOS or Android engineer to help us take our apps to the next level.

For what it's worth, I found a discussion about Ultra HDR. It doesn't seem to be a priority right now, though: https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/779 reply",

As of now, I use SentenceTransformer model to chunk files, blip for captioning (“Family vacation in Banff, February 2025”)) and mtcnn with InsightFace for face detection. My index stores captions, face embeddings, and EXIF metadata (date, GPS) for queries like “show photos of us in Banff last winter.” I’m working on integrating ChromaDB for faster searches. Eventually, I aim to store indexes as: { \"filename\": \"/Vacation/Banff/Wife.jpg\",\n\n  \"chunk_id\": 0,\n\n  \"text\": \"Family at Banff, February 2025\",\n\n  \"caption_embedding\": [0.1, 0.2, ...],\n\n  \"face_embeddings\": [{\"name\": \"NT\", \"embedding\": [0.3, 0.4, ...]}, ...],\n\n  \"exif\": {\n     \n     \"DateTimeOriginal\": \"2025:02:15\",\n\n     \"GPSCoordinates\": \"18.387, -65.992\"\n\n    } } I also built an UI (like Spotlight Search) to search through these indexes.

Haven't tried it for face recognition, but if you already have identified someone in one photo, it can probably tell you if the person in that photo is also in another photo Just one caveat, if you are processing thousands of pictures, it will take a while to process them all (depending on your hardware and picture size). You could also try creating a processing pipeline, first extracting faces or bounding boxes of the faces with something like opencv, and then passing those to gemma3 Please post repo link if you ever decide to open source reply",

I can share some more details, foibles and pitfalls if you'd like. I initiated a rescan last week, which stacks background jobs in a queue that gets called by cron 2 or 3 times a day. Recognize has been cranking through 10k-20k photos per day, with good results. I've installed a desktop client on my dad's laptop so he can dump all of the family hard drives we've accumulated over the years. The client does a good job of clearing up disk space after uploading, which is a huge advantage in my setup. My dad has used the OneDrive client before, so he was able to pick up this process very quickly. Nextcloud also has a decent mobile client that can auto-upload photos and videos, which I recently used to help my mother-in-law upload media from her 7-year-old iPhone. reply",

The images/pictures side of things has seen quite a lot of development and with some addons you get image classification with fairly minimal effort. The system as a whole will quite happily handle many 100,000 files with pretty rubbish hardware, if you are happy to wait for batch jobs to run or you throw more hardware at it and speed up the job schedules. NC has a stock phone app which works very well these days, including camera folder uploads.  There are several more apps that integrate with the main one to add optional functionality.  For example notes and voip. It is a very large and mature setup with loads of documentation and hence extensible by a determined hacker if something is missing. reply",

Nether had any performance issues with a few minor exceptions on Immich (I don't recall anything from PhotoPrism but it has been a while now since I switched) 1. The Immich app's performance is awful. It is a well known problem and their current focus. I have pretty high confidence that it will be fixed within a few months. Web app is totally fine though. 2. Some background operations such as AI indexing, face detection and video conversion don't work gracefully when restarted from scratch. They all basically first delete all the old data, then start processing assets. So for many days (depending on your parallelism settings and server performance) you may be completely missing some assets from search or converted videos. But you only need to do this very rarely (change encoding settings and want to apply to the back catalog or switch AI search model). I don't upload at a particularly high rate but my sever can very easy handle the steady state. 1 is pretty major but being worked on and you can work around it by just opening the website. 2 is less important but I don't think there is any work on it. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

          "text": "Still working on:  an enclosure-compatible open-source version of the 2nd gen Nest thermostat. It reuses the enclosure, encoder ring, display, and mounts of the Nest but replaces the \"thinking\" part with an open-source PCB that can interact with Home Assistant. - The encoder ring which works like an LED mouse, but in reverse: Fully reverse-engineered and on its own demo PCB - The faceplate PCB, which does the actual control of the thermostat wires, has been laid out, but the first version missed a really-obvious problem involving the behavior on power-on with certain of the GPIO pins from the ESP32, so I've got rev 3 on order from the PCB manufacturer. Nest Thermostats of the 1st and 2nd generation will no longer be supported by Google starting October 25, 2025. You will still be able to access temperature, mode, schedules, and settings directly on the thermostat – and existing schedules should continue to work uninterrupted. However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist. It has been pretty-badly supported in Home Assistant for over a year anyway, missing important connected features. reply",

Strongly recommend the rust remover described by Backyard Ballistics[0] on his second channel[1]; 1 liter water, 100g citric acid, 40g washing soda, generous squirt of dish soap. He claims the acid and alkali cancel out so there's nothing to attack the normal metal surface, but they leave citrate ions which dissolve rust by chelation, which makes it better than just citric acid, vinegar, or soda alone, which all pit and dissolve the clean metal surfaces, and easier/better than wire wool scratching. He also claims it's as effective as EvapoRust but much cheaper and can do more rust dissolving per litre than EvapoRust.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

It's an area with some heavyweight incumbents (e.g. Visio, Lucid) but I think there's good opportunity here to differentiate in simplicity and overall experience. I'm still in the fairly early phase, and I suspect I haven't quite found the best match of features to customers yet. From a dev perspective this area has a ton of super interesting algorithmic / math / data structure applications, and computational geometry has always been special to me. It's a lot of fun to work on. If anyone here is interested in this as a user, I'd love for any feedback or comments, here or you can email me directly: tyler@vexlio.com.

          "text": "Years ago I was making a diagram editor with the intent of doing code generation from diagrams (like simulink, not stateflow). I started with splines for the connections and decided straight lines and junctions would be better for complex diagrams. I realized that a better way to internally define the connecting wires is via a set of lines and their connectivity (vs their endpoint coordinates). Imagine each line segment is defined by a direction (vertical or horizontal) and a position (perpendicular distance from the origin) Like ax+by=d where a and b are either 0 or 1. You also need to define which other lines it connects to. Given the list of connections you can then calculate the intersections at rendering time. By sorting the list of connections you can render the line without features at the start and end, and then draw junctions for any intermediate connections. The beauty of this would be to allow dragging blocks around and having the lines follow with the junctions passing through each other as needed. There is some housekeeping with this data structure (merging colinear segments that connect, breaking segments when needed) but the UI for dragging should be much better than anything out there. reply",

Given the years since ChatGPT and the billions invested I’d expect more tectonic changes than “It wrote my term paper.” Companies have not replaced employees with AI doing the same job at any scale.

Like right now, native mobile jobs are mostly unaffected by AI. Gemini, despite all the data in the community, doesn't do a decent job at it. If you ask it to build an app from scratch, the architecture will be off. It'll use an outdated tech stack from 2022. It will 'correct' perfectly good data to an older form, and if you ask it to hunt for bugs in cutting edge tech, it might rip out the new one and replace it with old stuff. It often confuses methods that are common between different languages like .contains(). But if very high quality data is easily accessible, e.g. writing, digital art, voice acting, etc, that makes it viable to be cloned by AI. There's little animation data and there's even less oil painting data - so something like oil painting will be greatly more resistant than digital art. It's top tier on Python and yet it struggles with Ren'Py. Anthropic released experiment results from getting it to manage a vending machine: https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1 This is a fairly simple task for a human, and Claudius has plenty of reasoning and financial data.

So if my C compiler is a 2025 version, and my code makes use of features added since 2022, then the AI can \"retrogress\" the code simply because it isn't aware of the new. Or another example, imagine when JavaScript Promises were new. There's a lot more examples of \"not using promises\" than \"using promises \". So the AI us likely to use the old pattern. If you're doing \"up to the minute \" code because you put the effort in to keep abreast of new stuff, then this retrograde will seem, well, frustrating. reply",

          "text": "... and: I've identified several prominent DIY electronics magazines from the early 1980s in the US. The most promising candidates, based on the user's description, are 'Popular Electronics' and 'Byte'. 'Popular Electronics' was a highly circulated magazine that even inspired the founding of Microsoft, and it transitioned into 'Computers & Electronics' in 1982. 'Byte' was a leading computer magazine that often featured electronics content and was known for its distinctive cover art by Robert Tinney. Other magazines like 'Radio Electronics Magazine', 'Nuts and Volts', 'Elektor Electronics Magazine', 'Practical Electronics', 'Circuit Cellar', 'Silicon Chip Magazine', and 'Hobby Electronics' were also noted, but 'Popular Electronics' and 'Byte' seem to be the strongest fits for the US context and time frame. reply",

          "text": "It's just people following trends I think,  designers not knowing about WCAG, and designers with decent eyesight not knowing to consider people with poor eyesight. Someone sees some elegant looking site that has grey text and/or thin text, they copy it, someone else copies that etc. without really thinking about what it's going to be like to read a long article with that design. - From my experience working with designers, many have minimal understanding of WCAG and will only adjust the contrast near the end of the design phase (as in, after the client has signed-off on it) to get it within passing limits if they're told to, and only if it's easy to do without spoiling their design. - The rules for body text are pretty simple and I'm not excusing it, but WCAG is intimidating and confusing for most I think (ask designers why they don't follow it or understand it). There's loads of rules, the documentation is verbose, and it tells you what needs to pass, but lacks guidelines on how to do this in a way that doesn't change the look of your  branded designs. - I've been in this situation as a developer a few times where I'll tell the designer what specific WCAG rules aren't being followed, and they'll not change anything because they don't know what to do without compromising their design e.g. I'll mention \"your main brand color can be used for large heading text, but it doesn't contrast enough for buttons\", where the options might include picking a darker brand color (a big ask), a darker color just for buttons (might look weird), or maybe black for buttons (will change the look a lot). - It's really common for designers to pick bright/vibrant colors for the main brand color too that won't be accessible for body/button/link text, so being told they have to pick a darker color can feel like a big unfair restriction, especially when they see large brands or the designers they follow breaking the WCAG contrast rules all the time. Also, when most brand guidelines don't include contrast metrics for recommended color pairings, you can tell this hasn't been thought about much. To help with the above, I started working on a tool to create branded color palettes, with the idea that you pick the colors for your headings, buttons, body text etc. that  have accessible contrast upfront, rather than tweaking the contrast of these as an afterthought later: https://www.inclusivecolors.com/ reply",

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

In order to keep the hologram steady and anchored you need to perform a mapping process so that the helmet recognizes both the physical steel assembly and a bit of the surrounding area to keep it steady when moving around. The 8GB of RAM puts a limit on the amount of mapping data that can be stored putting a limit of the size of assembly you can work with, and since the mapping process relies on using the helmets own software that has not been work on in years it is extremely sensitive to any sort of background movement, which means it works best in as controlled of a environment as possible. Right now we are just using it for special projects that are complex and have little margin for error. We'd like to be able to use it for everything but that isn't feasible with where the tech is currently stuck at. reply",

A heads up display is just looking at the blueprint on a piece of paper with an additional layer of complexity, it wouldn't remove the need to manually measure, nor would it provide any assistance in spotting missing attached pieces (or some extra pieces). Once the model is overlayed QC goes from having to measure the placement of every pieces and the location of every hole to just walking around the finished assembly and ensuring that every conforms to the civil engineer approved model. A half hour process can be done faster and more precisely in 5 minutes, you notices very quickly when there is solid steel where the hologram has a hole, or thin air where the hologram shows that a plate was suppose to be welded on. reply",

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

That and most customers had a content problem. The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. There was an instance where I asked techs why they weren't using the headset for showing what they were seeing in realtime and they said, it's easier to facetime (hard to argue that). The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works).

I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to.

Pleasantly surprised how usable it is for 3-6 hour stretches, more productive than just a laptop screen alone. At home I'll likely return to physical monitors though. Tips: Get an upgraded headband, silicone face cover and carrying case. Use a physical USB connection for lower latency (& turn off the wifi/bluetooth as it's no longer needed). Bring a cloth for keeping the lenses clean. Bump the Retina quality up in the Immersed client (on Mac). Lower resolutions (1920x1080) are more comfortable to use over longer periods. Use a travel neck pillow for reclined usage. Bring replacement batteries and a charger for the controllers. reply",

It's not actually the weight. I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR head strap, external battery, etc that all add up to be heavier than the AVP, but I can easily go for multi-hour social sessions with that on without any physical discomfort. You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it. The closest thing I've seen to making it comfortable is the third-party ResMed Kontor headstrap, and that's being produced in such low numbers that it's functionally impossible to actually buy. reply",

My daily driver is a 43\" 4K monitor. Basically 4x 24\" 1080p monitors in one. It's the exact opposite of portable. I can get any task done with my laptop. But not a full day's work.

First responders and retailers have some of the largest internal deployments out there, but they aren’t massively publicized (most people would never guess who’s fielding the largest fleet of headsets right now). That said, it’s still not mass adoption. At the end of the day, you are asking someone to put something on their face that is still very different ergonomically than glasses (and I’m not sure even glasses would overcome enough friction). The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

          "text": "We’ve developed VR based industrial safety training, as a self-contained, portable product for blue collar workers in India - launched about 24 months ago with regular updates. Multiple companies have bought it, and we have large companies as clients who’ve used it to train 1000s of their blue-collar workers, even in sectors such as construction in a relatively challenging (in terms of pricing and value) market. We have a significant (I think!) number of devices deployed, and most of my clients end up purchasing more after the initial purchase and pilot. I think that’s for a few reasons: 1) VR, when well designed, can offer 1st person experience of being an accident victim due to the viewer’s own oversight / someone else’s oversight. That makes it a far more effective way to draw the learner’s attention to the importance of the safety protocols, etc. 2) Our solution is multi-lingual: it’s currently available in 10 regional Indian languages - that matters, since a significant fraction of the workforce may not understand English. Our localisation extends beyond that, but language is a big thing in enabling access and usage. 3) if you have to invest 10-15 min per learner (often one-on-one as the instructor) to onboard each learner before they can use your solution, it becomes very difficult to scale and raises the bar for cost-effectiveness. So that’s something we focus on heavily. 4) Setup time- don’t create a solution that requires IT support, someone who understands how to setup / load SteamVR / Oculus Link / meta Horizon. If the solution adds 20-30 min workload to the staff on a site, then adopting it becomes that much more painful - so we’ve worked very hard to develop an integrated system where the instructor can quickly onboard 10-15 learners and get going with the session in 5 min. 5) workflow changes: often, introducing VR means changing some part of the organisation’s workflow - many VR solutions don’t consider this / acknowledge this in their design- clients get initially excited, but when it comes to actually using it on a daily basis, the deployment and workflow frictions can completely tank VR adoption. I’ve seen multiple solutions fail because of this, and we focus extensively on this when we design our solutions. India is a hard market for VR, honestly because it’s very price sensitive. But I think we’ve made some progress here, because we’ve focused extensively on system robustness, ease of deployment, localization, and a lot of user-centered design. We’ve also developed sophisticated VR - based training solutions for SOP training. VR can be / is, very effective for initial onboarding and SOP training. Again, the challenge here is usability - most of the learner’s don’t know how to use the controllers. Learning how to use the controllers is not easy and takes time. So that onboarding is critical and needs to be done well. In SOP training, our experience is that it can, if designed well, significantly reduce on-boarding time; however, you still need the last 20% of training on the actual thing for it to stick, and for the learner to actually _learn_.

          "text": "AR is much harder as a solution to deploy at scale, I think. First off, most solutions work poorly out in day light - especially the bright Indian sun. So that automatically adds friction in terms of deployment opportunities / field deployment. The second issue is the limited FoV: 40-45 degrees. That's a pretty small display area to play with in terms of pushing detailed information, etc. Third, again, the usability, ruggedness and user-onboarding challenges. So, the use case has to be important enough and significant enough that the user / organization needs to accept all these frictions and still derive enough value out of the solution - that leaves very few use cases. Add to that, HoloLens is expensive, hasn’t seen any significant development in the past few years, and real wear type devices too aren’t cheap for large scale adoption - a smartphone / tablet in hand is often a better / more maintainable / cost effective solution even compared to real wear - I’ve seen clients securely mount a smartphone on their helmet and setup a teams call for remote viewing - it works! reply",

Some of the current customers might be able to use ANY distribution to patch problems for a while. Eventually, someone mightneed to decide on serious maintenance or not. But initially it quite possibly would not require much. When there are current users, the future may not be a thriving project but may be simply a patched up current solution. Nothing wrong with that. I suspect this is the case pretty often: a current solution is not great but it's in place. The code itself is nothing to write home about, but it's in place.

It still ends up mostly being a 2 party thing. Supporting your team is deep rooted. However at least there is the potential for a third party to get in. But it suffers from the same statistical issue. If a quarter of voters vote green but equally across seats then that popular vote is not represented in the number of seats. It is a vote of a vote still. I wonder if we can move away from representation purely on where you live. Where you live means something. City vs. Countryside. Poor neighbourhoods vs. Rich.

          "text": "no mention of any system-level strategy on the website. this may as well be another lobbying group. pumping more candidates (even good ones) into a busted system is like increasing the flow rate into a cracked bucket. good metrics showing how much more is going in, with little attention paid to how much is flowing out. i do appreciate the ambition to change things at a higher level, but there is nothing resembling significant disruption here. my suggestion would be to identify a single, core point of systemic leverage that can actually make a demonstrable change to the way things operate (i.e. patch the bucket or, better still, replace it). for example, if you can get a sensible cap put on the amount of funds that can be given in support of a political campaign (yeah, i know, good luck with that) or can instigate a nationwide movement for proportional representation, or tie up the practice of gerrymandering, that might get momentum for a bigger step. i'm sure there is lots i don't know about the role and potential for independents in the US (i live elsewhere), but the principle still holes that a problem must be solved by a higher level of complexity than the one that created it. so i implore you, don't stop what you are doing, but try to find the next step up into systems thinking or, even better, meta-systematic strategy, which is actually what is needed for serious political reform. there are, of course, many ways to shoot down my argument, and it is true to some extent that 'policy is personnel', but the level of systemic failure evidenced in recent years makes me think that such an initiative, while valuable in itself, cannot flourish in the way it needs to in order to be effective reply",

It’s very much a system level strategy, but more by way of democratized technology as opposed to head on disruption. I asked the same questions when I joined. We want to provide powerful technology to candidates that are not going to be supported by the two main parties. And we have some other qualifications, like not taking corporate money. The more that independent candidates can succeed and win, the more we normalize the electorate expecting something that isn’t just to two main parties. In a way, it’s the electorate that we are trying to empower by supporting viable alternatives to the current system. I’m glad there is interest in what we’re doing. I think we are on track too, making increasing impacts and I am excited about our growing team. reply",

Never-ending data requests – because no one can find (or trust) the right query, engineers and analytics teams still get pinged for “one more pull.” 3. ChatGPT doesn’t have full DB context - non technical users are writing incorrect SQL that lacks context AND technical users are rewriting the same queries over and over again LOOKING FOR: We're looking for high agency, high velocity individuals and someone who wants to be part of a family.

I'm a builder, tinkerer, cheerleader, and teacher at heart. I've lead teams and managed contractors. I developed threat models, assessment processes, reverse-engineering practices, handling procedures, and reporting structures. I've created prototypes and product proposals. I've designed PCBs, laid them out in Altium, and assembled them. I've worked with SDRs and GNURadio, various FPGAs, PLCs, microcontrollers, and lots of other hardware (vacuum tubes are a hobby). I'm cognizant of anti-tamper and trust assurance techniques (I've even broken a few!), various side-channel analyses, fault injection, cyber-physical system exploits, and LLMs (I broke a couple of those, too). reply",

I do a lot of programming, usually in Python and C++, and with a mathematical or algorithmic focus. For example, as part of my research I developed a BDD library that uses complexity theory to guarantee correctness with small overhead. Or recently, in my spare time, I created an AI for MTG (drafting, to be precise), using a transformer architecture with PyTorch. I am very enthusiastic about using or coming up with theoretical ideas that can improve outcomes in practice. I rely on having strong fundamentals, from mathematics over algorithms to knowledge of the actual hardware, to enable me to easily pick up new areas and tackle novel problems. Most of my research is the result of collaborations — it is important to me to both support my colleagues and be able to learn from them.

I have also developed software for non-scientific purposes, like creating user interfaces for desktop applications. I have years of experience working with large datasets, including the tasks of calculating statistics and developing hypotheses/models/theories from data. I've worn many hats over the years and love learning new and interesting topics. reply",

Most recently, I spent several years at Google working full-stack on applications that supported our customer service teams. I then switched to working on facilitating our teams through building frameworks, teaching, and overall enabling them to quickly launch applications.

We were focused on building data pipelines and models to protect our users from malicious phonecalls. If you know the phrase \"Scam Likely\", we were a pioneer :) There is a noticeable gap in my resume where I was dealing with health issues from 2022 - 2024, but am looking to rejoin the software industry.

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I've taken countless projects from 0 to 1 and worked for clients like JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, Rob Walling, Trello, Peter Diamandis, Syncthing, SimplyCredit and others. I'm experienced in Vue.js, Django, Phoenix framework, Quasar and many others, I've worked with most web tech stacks out there. I pick up new tech easily and like working on complex products. Case studies are on my website: https://gilli.is . I can provide the following for you: - Product Design — Whether you need a design from scratch, a redesign, or you're having issues with a small part of your product, I can design it. - Front-end Development — I can build the design into a pixel perfect product. This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort. I've worked with a wide range of frontend and backend technologies and can hit the ground running on new projects. I pick up new tech quickly, which makes it easy for me to adapt to different environments. - Analysis — Your users, know everything that's wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That's where my usability analysis comes in. I'll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback. - Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free. I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.

Before I got laid off - I was making it @ Autodesk. I have quite some experience dealing with LLM based applications - taming them into giving more sane answers. The best one that I have built so far lets you attach to any data sources (SQL/NoSQL/Files) etc and then just ask questions about them. Literally any question (even outside the schema) and it never makes up stuff. My going rate at the moment is $5 per hour (subject to complexity and my preference) - capped at 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is around $200/wk at minimum. I am very transparent about my work and I do not ask for payment beforehand and no compulsion to pay if work is not up to your standards. Also, before I take you as my client, we will do a call - this helps me to have a measure at your expectations/requirements and helps to build a bond which is something I really value. If you prefer - you could directly schedule a meet @ https://calendly.com/suvarnanarayanan2g/30min?month=2025-07 If you cannot make the slots to work for the calendar above, please shoot me an email and I will do a meet at a time you are comfortable with.

Tools I use most frequently these days: Typescript, node, React, pnpm+vite. I've also done extensive work with three.js in the past. I used to write a lot of Java and a bit of Objective C, have dabbled in Rust and Elixir. I've done a lot of work in developer tools and data visualization of various kinds. Data-rich, non-traditional UIs with highly optimized UX, and rapid prototyping are my forte.

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | Remote | CET Location: around 46/14\nIn past 20 years did many different projects, mostly worked with teams 1-5. 60% of projects were related to sport and TV, rest was various other fields. I was jumping between leading, architecting, designing, programming and things in-between :) Last years I programmed mostly in C# (web services, aspnet, razor, ...) also desktop apps (WinForms, WPF, Avalonia), JS/Typescript (mostly for gui, I enjoyed mithril and now SolidJS). I also did some c++ for various small integrations (for example some plugin for Godot, some ffmpeg, ...) and lately studying Rust. Mostly worked with GPC 70% , AWS 20%, other 10%. I like to make GUI/backends that makes sense, are easy to understand (test with users) and performant/fast. Also to last years, with minimum dependencies. I also have experience with live events setup for small broadcast of events, networking experience I did tons of remote support with people around the world, also know how to use this information to make better programs (or design...). I do not have any experience with AI. Looking for 20-100 hours per month. hellohn@smmx.dev reply",

Email:juan.carlos@micronixsolutions.com I've had the opportunity to work as a founding engineer at multiple companies, where I've been involved in building and scaling platforms from scratch. At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails. Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon. Now it's time for something new.

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | US/Canada Remote | Toronto Hybrid I'm experimenting with a new model for CS education using advisors who follow and adapt to students' interests. The core idea is that students should learn how to learn early and to self-direct their own education. However, they need support for when they get stuck. At the moment, I'm looking to work with students who have deep interests in CS/tech, but want something more dynamic than a fixed curriculum program. Experience:\n* Self-taught programmer.\n* Worked on data engineering at a large hospital. \n* Ex-VC - worked on technology due-diligence.\n* Started independent R&D lab (www.ithron.com).\n* Designed this model based on my experiences hiring engineers. Engagement model:\n* Work with students 1 on 1\n* ideal age range is 16-21, \n* 2-3 hours of meetings per week + 15-20 hours of self-directed time\n* 3 month batches, can be extended to a full-year.\n* More info at: https://www.divepod.to Feel free to reach out at: frank [at] divepod [dot] to reply",

          "text": "Yours is not the first post asking about this here.  Which in and of itself says something. I don't use them, at all.  I briefly tried the local tab completion stuff offered in JetBrains products.  It lasted an hour or two.  The log messages it wrote didn't sound like me, and the \"copilot pause\" was immediately frustrating. The boilerplate argument comes up a lot, but I really don't see it as the huge issue that would drive me to try and make Clippy generate it for me.  That sort of \"boring\" work is great for \"meditating\" on the thing you're doing.  Spending time adjacent to the problem putting up the scaffolding makes you mentally examine the places where things are going to interact and gives that little seed of an idea time to grow a bit.  Become more robust. Later, when there's an issue, you can ask the human that wrote something questions about it and they will probably have at least a fuzzy recollection of how it was built (and why it was done that way) that can offer ideas.  Best you can do is hope the LLM doesn't hallucinate when you ask it about all the broken stuff. Ultimately I see neither value nor \"power\" in the current \"assistants.\"  They generate the  statistically most median output and often get it wrong.  They make stuff up.  They have no understanding of anything, and they don't learn from mistakes.  If they were a person you'd be asking serious, but nearly rhetorical, questions about whether or not to fire them. reply",

If that's your target, then you might possibly be operating under at least a few wrong assumptions. As they say, you always want to sell to stakeholders. In large orgs, most people you can talk to just earn a salary. If you're selling time, money, or savings for the org , they're rarely interested. What usually holds their attention are magicians that offer to make their problems disappear . You're trying to sell a DIY kit to companies where, past a certain size, the type of competency required becomes a rare commodity in-house (regardless of how ridiculously simple the solution). So they typically avoid upgrading themselves into new problems. Integrating a SaaS is always a new problem. In addition to selling the tools to solve their problems, can you also offer to sell the service that makes them go away? Can you be the magician that makes entire problems disappear? What if you told them you'll take them away for a fee, could that get their attention? Try it and see if it at least gets the conversation going. If it does, you can lay out a price table where you charge a premium to hire a few people to work on it with your own tools. reply",

          "text": "People don't reply because they don't feel the pain you remove. Timing is everything. You can monitor socials for individuals complaining about the pain point or about a competitor and reach out when you got a proper \"signal\". I also avoid saying things like \"free trial\". Instead, I offer to give them access to the paid product to try it out. It sounds less car salesman-y and as a receiver it feels nicer to get access to a paid product rather than a free trial everyone can have. Semantics most of the time, but it helps. You can write organic content about how to solve those pains (and hope people searching for solutions find it). When you do get customers you should always include a form that asks _why_ they are unsubscribing. I have learned a lot from it and it also offers a chance to turn customers back around. If someone complains about the price, I can give them a discounted rate. If someone complains about a specific quality issue I can give them free credits to make up for used ones, etc. Always respond quickly. I have landed many customers simply because I respond quickly to emails. I've had customers tell me they chose my service over \"big competitor Y\" because I respond to their emails (even though my service is more expensive). If you have an entire vertical, don't undervalue the small fish. I target ~3 different types of customers and the bulk of my revenue comes from one specific type of customer. I almost got rid of the other two customers, but realized my largest customer ($1XX,XXX/year) started off as a small fish for a year before becoming a big fish. That may go against some of the traditional advice, as the small fish tend to account for most of the support... but in my case it works out. A lot of the small customers end up being a channel on their own. A person leaves company A and goes to company B. They introduce your product at company B because they used it at company A. When I speak with people I always ask how they found out about my product. Nine times out of ten it's a \"coworker used your product at a different company\". reply",

With that assumption: Marketing became much more important than it used to be. I used to be able to rely on organic growth from people finding my SaaS using search engines. But this ended several years ago. Marketing also became much more difficult than it used to be. Generic ads on Google or LinkedIn no longer work, unless you can spend huge amounts of money on testing. I found all paid ads to be a waste of money. If you have a B2B SaaS, you run into the additional problem of people being busy and not hanging out in forums. With consumers, things are more straightforward. You can generally blast an ad on Reddit, Instagram, and some other sites, and people will see it. Not so with B2B. Many of your customers will be busy working, and they will not pay any attention to work-related ads outside of work. Content marketing also became more difficult. With search engines, especially Google, going down the drain and the deluge of crappy SEO-gaming and AI-generated content, it's difficult to rise above the noise.

Another thing I realized: the intended user and the actual user can be very different. In my case, I built an app called foundersmail.xyz, which gives users access to founders' official emails and other details. I got the idea after seeing someone else build a similar tool for investors — it worked well for him, but he already had an audience and reputation. For me, I promoted it across various subreddits and platforms and got around 100 users. I noticed that only 20–30% actually used up their free credits. While debugging this, I discovered most of my users were students cold-emailing founders for summer internships. I thought at least one of them might convert — but unfortunately, none did (still trying to figure that part out). My two biggest mistakes: No traffic — not enough eyeballs. Target audience mismatch — students using it instead of founders or professionals. Interestingly, there are competitors making money with similar products, so I know there’s potential. I’m still figuring out what’s missing in my approach. That said, I’m okay with the outcome so far. I haven’t spent a single rupee — free domain, free hosting, and I built it in my spare time and vibe coded. It was an experiment rather than an actual business. reply",

I've had an app get thousands of views based on a reddit post, and not one person (literally 0) bothered to click outside of the page (i.e. were curious what app this is). Social media is a false sense of validation, even if you get a hit. Direct sales is the only thing that I found that works consistently. Get in front of anyone in this organization. My guess is you're trying to do too direct so you send a spammy email telling them how great your product is. Don't do that. Don't try to sell them anything. Don't even tell them you have a product. Just get them on a zoom call and ask them what they do now and why it sucks. People are much more receptive to take a call and tell you about what they do or their problems than they are to hear a sales pitch. reply",

I understand (and in certain context appreciate) hesitancy to blatant self-promotion but this is not the time. Not seeing your website, websites of who you think your competitors are, links to your promotional efforts etc. makes it impossible to give good advice. The best you can hope for is generic, vague advice. The devil is in details. Maybe your website is bad. Maybe your product isn't as great as you think. Maybe your pitch is not good. Generically I would say most people don't do enough promotion and could improve their \"first time use\" (onboarding) experience. For example I make a note-taking application for developers and power users: https://edna.arslexis.io/ Almost all of my users came from Show HN post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40846242 So it's a sobering realization that I got lucky enough that the post was interesting and generated discussion and made people try the app. At the same time, I know I could be doing more marketing. I know I could improve onboarding, I could record videos showing how to use more advanced features etc. Chances are you could do more marketing and you could improve onboarding in your app but to give you specific, actionable advice we would have to know much more about your app, your competitors, your marketing efforts. Not your description of those things, the actual website, the actual marketing post etc. reply",

          "text": "So here’s the rub. Your product is almost irrelevant, as long as it is at least mediocre at what it does. What matters is your marketing and your positioning. From how you describe it, it sounds like you’re selling steak, not the sizzle - you say what it is capable of but not what it does for you. You mention that it could save “ten hours for real”, and this is the point you need to drive home - this will save you money, make you money, make you more attractive to investors, give you time and peace of mind . As to channels - social media rules the roost. Pay YouTube and TikTok influencers to shill for you. If you don’t believe enough in your product to pay for marketing, why should they believe in it? Push out hype-laden press releases. Thump your chest. Drop emails to journalists in the space, with pre-written soundbites and a link to the release. Make it easy content for them to sling up on their platform. The bar is low . Pick a vertical. Work it, target it, saturate it with your product. If you can find a vertical that’s underserved, then start there. Finally, make sure your landing page speaks to the above, and hammers the point home right out of the gate. “Vidlify will help you get that Ferrari you always wanted. Here’s how:” Save jargon for the “I’m excited, tell me more”. Then, either it will fly, and you can progress to a broader market, or it won’t, and you either accept your loss and move on, or tweak and try again - but don’t get caught in the sunk costs fallacy - just because you’ve already spent X time and Y money, it doesn’t mean you have to commit more.

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

          "text": "Still working on:  an enclosure-compatible open-source version of the 2nd gen Nest thermostat. It reuses the enclosure, encoder ring, display, and mounts of the Nest but replaces the \"thinking\" part with an open-source PCB that can interact with Home Assistant. - The encoder ring which works like an LED mouse, but in reverse: Fully reverse-engineered and on its own demo PCB - The faceplate PCB, which does the actual control of the thermostat wires, has been laid out, but the first version missed a really-obvious problem involving the behavior on power-on with certain of the GPIO pins from the ESP32, so I've got rev 3 on order from the PCB manufacturer. Nest Thermostats of the 1st and 2nd generation will no longer be supported by Google starting October 25, 2025. You will still be able to access temperature, mode, schedules, and settings directly on the thermostat – and existing schedules should continue to work uninterrupted. However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist. It has been pretty-badly supported in Home Assistant for over a year anyway, missing important connected features. reply",

This short documentary chronicles the story of Kawamura, a man who worked with legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa on the set of his opus \"Ran\". Kawamura was working in the BTS crew, but his footage got confiscated. It took almost 40 years to recover the footage and present that as his feature film. My film got screened at the Academy Award-qualifying Bali International Film Festival and the Marina Del Rey Film Festival in the past month. It will be screening next month in New York City at the Asian American International Film Festival. reply",

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

          "text": "Years ago I was making a diagram editor with the intent of doing code generation from diagrams (like simulink, not stateflow). I started with splines for the connections and decided straight lines and junctions would be better for complex diagrams. I realized that a better way to internally define the connecting wires is via a set of lines and their connectivity (vs their endpoint coordinates). Imagine each line segment is defined by a direction (vertical or horizontal) and a position (perpendicular distance from the origin) Like ax+by=d where a and b are either 0 or 1. You also need to define which other lines it connects to. Given the list of connections you can then calculate the intersections at rendering time. By sorting the list of connections you can render the line without features at the start and end, and then draw junctions for any intermediate connections. The beauty of this would be to allow dragging blocks around and having the lines follow with the junctions passing through each other as needed. There is some housekeeping with this data structure (merging colinear segments that connect, breaking segments when needed) but the UI for dragging should be much better than anything out there. reply",

In my scheme there would be one horizontal line right through it and one vertical line. There would also be 2 short horizontal lines connecting the vertical line to the P and D blocks. In my scheme you could drag the D block up to the top above the P (D,P,I) and the junctions would change (because they're locations are computed) even though the topology has not.

Unfortunately, I likely find myself in the big gap between the free tier and the Basic plan. I can't justify yet another subscription that I use only a couple of times a year. That said, I would happily pay the $6 on the months that I use the service. Given the churn issues, I'm surprised more SaaS offerings don't work that way. reply",

The short answer is yes, probably, but I don't have a concrete timeline. I made tech and architecture choices from the beginning to make sure a cross-platform desktop version always remains possible. Frankly, the biggest obstacle for desktop is not the app itself, but distribution and figuring out a pricing model. The current solution for enterprise, business, and other interested people, is to self-host Vexlio, with separate licensing. reply",

The downsides (possibility of data loss for, e. g., kids who are not very good with passwords/keys; difficulties with updating models / thumbs; …) remain important, and outweigh the benefits, even assuming the e2ee is implemented well. reply",

Well, unless your VPS is compromised in a manner of data loss for longer than you wished before your backups ran, in which case it's still better that such sensitive info was e2ee'd. edit: also feel like I'm echoing the classic dropbox comment, but self-hosting in a sane and secure manner is harder than it's made out to be.

Haven't tried it for face recognition, but if you already have identified someone in one photo, it can probably tell you if the person in that photo is also in another photo Just one caveat, if you are processing thousands of pictures, it will take a while to process them all (depending on your hardware and picture size). You could also try creating a processing pipeline, first extracting faces or bounding boxes of the faces with something like opencv, and then passing those to gemma3 Please post repo link if you ever decide to open source reply",

          "text": "I've been running Nextcloud in Docker with the Recognize and Memories apps for about a year and half now. It's in an off-lease refurbished Dell Precision tower from 2018. I'm using docker compose to include some supporting containers like go-vod (for hardware transcoding), another nextcloud instance to handle push notifications to the clients, and redis (for caching).  I can share some more details, foibles and pitfalls if you'd like. I initiated a rescan last week, which stacks background jobs in a queue that gets called by cron 2 or 3 times a day. Recognize has been cranking through 10k-20k photos per day, with good results. I've installed a desktop client on my dad's laptop so he can dump all of the family hard drives we've accumulated over the years. The client does a good job of clearing up disk space after uploading, which is a huge advantage in my setup. My dad has used the OneDrive client before, so he was able to pick up this process very quickly. Nextcloud also has a decent mobile client that can auto-upload photos and videos, which I recently used to help my mother-in-law upload media from her 7-year-old iPhone. reply",

          "text": "Memories and Recognize work fine with the base Nextcloud docker image. My host has a GPU so I use go-vod to leverage hardware transcoding. The base NC docker image can't access Nvidia cards (probably other GPUs as well). I could script in a way to do this but would need to run it after each update. Recognize runs fine on my CPU so I haven't explored this yet. I have an OpenMediaVault VM with a 10tb volume in the network that runs the S3 plugin (Minio-based) which is connected through Nextcloud's external storage feature (I want to migrate to Garage soon). I believe notify_push helps desktop clients cut down on the chatter when querying the external storage folder. Limiting the users that can access this also helps. I was having issues getting the notify_push app [1] to work in the container with my reverse-proxy. I found some similar setups that did this [2], so I added another nextcloud container to the docker-compose yaml like so: notify_push:\n    image: nextcloud\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - 7867:7867\n    depends_on:\n      - app\n    environment:\n      - PORT=7867\n      - NEXTCLOUD_URL=http://<local ip address of docker server>:8081\n    entrypoint: /var/www/html/custom_apps/notify_push/bin/x86_64/notify_push /var/www/html/config/config.php\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/nextcloud/customapps:/var/www/html/custom_apps\n      - /path/to/nextcloud/config:/var/www/html/config [1] - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/notify_push [2] - https://help.nextcloud.com/t/docker-caddy-fpm-notify-push-ca... reply",

Stock NC gets you a very solid general purpose document management system and with a few addons, you basically get self hosted SharePoint and OneDrive without the baggage. The images/pictures side of things has seen quite a lot of development and with some addons you get image classification with fairly minimal effort. The system as a whole will quite happily handle many 100,000 files with pretty rubbish hardware, if you are happy to wait for batch jobs to run or you throw more hardware at it and speed up the job schedules. NC has a stock phone app which works very well these days, including camera folder uploads.  There are several more apps that integrate with the main one to add optional functionality.  For example notes and voip. It is a very large and mature setup with loads of documentation and hence extensible by a determined hacker if something is missing. reply",

Nether had any performance issues with a few minor exceptions on Immich (I don't recall anything from PhotoPrism but it has been a while now since I switched) 1. The Immich app's performance is awful. It is a well known problem and their current focus. I have pretty high confidence that it will be fixed within a few months. Web app is totally fine though. 2. Some background operations such as AI indexing, face detection and video conversion don't work gracefully when restarted from scratch. They all basically first delete all the old data, then start processing assets. So for many days (depending on your parallelism settings and server performance) you may be completely missing some assets from search or converted videos. But you only need to do this very rarely (change encoding settings and want to apply to the back catalog or switch AI search model). I don't upload at a particularly high rate but my sever can very easy handle the steady state. 1 is pretty major but being worked on and you can work around it by just opening the website. 2 is less important but I don't think there is any work on it. reply",

My day generally looks like this: 8am read email 9am standup Usually some kind of meeting (planning, 1-on-1s, retro, something else) Heads down time Lunch, read at the park Heads down time until 5pm Fridays we alternate having a team symposium or a book club that I lead. Right now we happen to be reading the book referenced in [1]. Tasks are usually code based. Fixing/extending the agent code, tool writing/bug fixing, writing pipelines for data ingestion, etc. Part of my job is technology recommendations, so staying on top of the fast moving field and being able to match problems to best-in-class/stable tech choices is a must. I have a long software engineering background and am an excellent debugger - I rarely get stuck on a bug, only slowed down. I can rapidly prototype an idea, and then take it all the way to development, qa, and deployment, given the right resources. 1. In line with Chip Huyen's AI Engineering book.

What they build ranges from product features to internal tools. They make heavy use of LLM vendor inference APIs, vector databases, etc. They end up writing a lot of glue code and software to manage the context of the LLM, query for data, integrate with other systems and so on. They also develop front-end interfaces for their applications. Only recently have they started to, lightly, explore the idea of training LLMs with managed services like AWS SageMaker. All this is to say that, the “AI Engineer/SWE” title will probably represent vastly different things depending on the technical sophistication of the organization. If someone told me they were an AI Engineer at OpenAI I’d be more inclined to expect their role to be more fundamental, elsewhere, not so much. reply",

One of my specialties before Gen AI was working with Amazon Connect - a cloud hosted call center + Amazon Lex (the AWS version of Alexa) for voice, text and web and chatbots.  I use Gen AI to understand customer’s utterances better with Bedrock.  But at the end of the day, it’s really just another AWS SDK (Boto3) call. But my day to day is more about working with clients gathering requirements, integrating call centers with their backends, and everything that goes into a modern implementation - regular development, infrastructure as code, “DevOps” [sic], training, solving XYProblems, etc. I spend a lot of time telling clients “Gen AI isn’t what you want”.

          "text": "> Obama, no. Geoff Hinton has his opinions and I’ve listened to them. For every smart person who believes in AI and AGI happening soon you can find other smart people who argue the other way. So your argument is \"smart people are wrong sometimes so I will say he is one of those people\". Not an incorrect argument in principle, but it can be used to arbitrarily dismiss any opinion you disagree with. I think what's more important is the delta of average sentiment among experts. The general opinion you'd get talking to reasonably smart, well informed tech-adjacent people on the impending approach of AGI is very different now than a few years ago, and these are people who can tell the difference between marketing hype and legitimate impacts. >Trading stock and Azure credits don’t equal revenue. OpenAI, the leader in the AI industry, loses billions every quarter. Microsoft and Google and Meta subsidize their work from other profitable activities. The profit isn’t there. They're losing money because they're spending a lot on talent, datacenter buildup and training runs. This makes sense given the returns on scaling. This is like how people had said \"Amazon never made a profit\" for years, even though their money was just being put into growth. A lack of profitability during growth isn't a weird exception that proves that OpenAI and AI companies are scams, it's pretty much the standard for the tech industry due to the benefits of being a loss leader when money invested early is instrumental for relative market dominance. ChatGPT has 500 million active users. Over half of its billions in revenue is from ChatGPT plus subscriptions (which is mostly individuals paying for it, not b2b swap schemes.) >  I’d expect more tectonic changes than “It wrote my term paper.” My specific example was a bigger deal than \"It wrote my term paper\". Even so, I know you used that example as a shorthand for a tool of trivial utility, but a tool which can effectively write at the college is invariably a big deal. However it seems that every advance in AI shifts the goalposts. > I might agree, but I didn’t make that claim. AI tools probably can add value as tools. If you find a real example of AI taking over a professional job at scale let us know. Your claim was that it's unreasonable to assert that layoffs were in part due to AI. My claim is that AI being merely labor multiplying is enough for it to be an impetus for layoffs. Even if it's impossible for an AI tool to completely replace one job fully on its own with no human input, if a senior engineer could use an AI tool that allows them to perform the job of 1.5 equivalent engineers at a company, then that company requires only 2/3 its original number of engineers for the same output, which would preempt a layoff of the least productive engineers due to their contribution being made redundant. No one doubts that a smaller percentage of humans are employed as farmers today than were in the 1800s, but it would be silly to claim that since no robot exists that can fully perform every task that a farmer can completely autonomously that the massive reduction in farm jobs since the 1800s could not have been in any part due to technological advancements. No one single farmer has been \"fully replaced\", but the integration of labor multiplying tools allowed a smaller number of farmers to perform the duties of far more, which is what is effectively happening with AI tools. > We could have better discussions if the AI industry wasn’t led by chronic liars and frauds, people making ridiculous self-serving predictions not backed by anything that resembles science. AI gets literally shoved down our throats with no demonstrated or measurable benefit, poor accuracy, severe limitations, heavy costs that get subsidized by investors and the public. Forget about the energy and environmental impact. Which “side” acts in good faith in the so-called debate? Every booming industry is rife with those seeking to maximally exploit its growth potential. This was true with the emergence of electricity, the dot-com boom, mobile phones, etc. Anyone with a brain could see that in any new flashy domain there is a lot of deceptive hype, but anyone with a brain could also see that these new advancements did massively impact the world and in many ways improved productivity and general technological enablement. > I have. You just need to take the critics seriously. No one can even define intelligence or AGI, but they sure can sell it to FOMO CIOs. You still haven't provided any substantive arguments beyond \"AI company CEOs are all a pack of liars\", outright denial of any claim I make, and reflexive dismissal of any citation I provide. The substance of your arguments seems to rely on retreating to a bastion of impossible to certify claims, using the lack of absolute consensus in one direction as evidence that the complete opposite claim must be correct. Claiming that \"no one can define intelligence or AGI\" has absolutely no bearing on whether LLMs or the like are effectively performing many tasks humans consider essential to intelligence. These semantic hideaways would be a sensible area to take shelter in if this were 1999 and machine intelligence were a far-off fantasy, but ignoring much of the realities emerging across the economy and society is a rhetorical flourish you can only pull off for so long. reply",

You raised those issues and then put words in my mouth.

The impact of AI remains to be seen. The hype and fear-mongering serves the AI companies in a blatantly obvious way, so we should take their claims skeptically. Maybe it will all come true, but even if we get AGI next week that won’t explain the layoffs in tech and other sectors that started several years ago.

That of course works both ways. If so-called AI offers benefits I will adapt, just as I’ve adapted to many new things during my career. If it fizzles out or falls short of the promises I will still have a job. Right now the AI coding tools add nothing for me. Other programmers may have different experiences. Programmers with years of experience in multiple business domains, like me, have the least to fear from AI. I think excluding young people just starting their careers, at a time when an LLM can plausibly do the same work under supervision, will choke off the path to senior developer and the necessary mentoring and real-world experience. AI may create a demographic crisis even if it doesn’t actually replace senior programmers. The damage will come from management short-sightedness and short-term profit seeking, not the technology itself. In any case the question of what AI can do or might do only has a little to do with layoffs in tech and other sectors, and that was the original topic. reply",

If you ask it to build an app from scratch, the architecture will be off. It'll use an outdated tech stack from 2022.

So if my C compiler is a 2025 version, and my code makes use of features added since 2022, then the AI can \"retrogress\" the code simply because it isn't aware of the new. Or another example, imagine when JavaScript Promises were new. There's a lot more examples of \"not using promises\" than \"using promises \". So the AI us likely to use the old pattern. If you're doing \"up to the minute \" code because you put the effort in to keep abreast of new stuff, then this retrograde will seem, well, frustrating. reply",

          "text": "One skill I believe will take the longest to be replaced by AI is interdisciplinary problem solving that involves empathy, ambiguity, and context-shifting across real-world domains. What makes this hard for AI isn't just the \"thinking\" part—LLMs are already impressive there. It's the judgment required to navigate situations where data is sparse, stakes are high, and the path forward involves reconciling trade-offs between humans, systems, and unpredictable environments. Think of a doctor diagnosing a rare condition while calming an anxious patient, or a civil engineer weighing community concerns during an infrastructure redesign. Another safe haven for now is the ability to guide and control AI. People who deeply understand the limitations of AI systems—and can design governance, oversight, and fallback processes—are going to be essential as AI becomes more embedded in critical decision-making. I’m currently working on a side project called “AI Chat Co-Pilot” that flags architectural dependencies and offers deployment guidance based on company-specific code analysis. One of the key things I’ve realized is how much human context and judgment still matters in deciding what not to automate. So maybe the safest skill isn't technical or creative alone, but knowing when to lean on AI—and when not to. Curious to hear what others think are the underrated \"sticky\" skills that AI will have a hard time swallowing. reply",

If you only listened to AI hype, you’d think that tutors are going to be extinct in a year or two. But the reality (which I have direct personal experience with) is that no one really wants to learn a language from a robot, no matter how human it seems or how sophisticated its learning algorithm is. Free or low cost language learning resources were already basically universal prior to recent AI tools. At the end of the day, people want to have a human connection for many (but certainly not all) things. This includes the actual learning conversation, but also things like a weekly scheduled meeting, a relationship that grows over time, paid incentives to show up, and so on - things that some AI app is not going to be able to do. If the cost of the human connection stays within reasonable limits, I don’t see it being eliminated by AI. reply",

Figure out where people who would want to use your project hang out online.  Share it there (if those places allow sharing projects and don't have a policy against it). Offer helpful advice in subreddits, Discords, Telegram, and other channels where people who would like your project hang out.  Don't spam your project, but do keep your project link in your profile, so that people who are really impressed by your helpfulness check it out, they will see it. If you have $, maybe see what people search for who would be interested in your project, and experiment with Google, Meta, or other (AI?) ad platforms.  But start small, it is easy to spend a lot. Or else just write prolifically about it.  Once a day/week/month, make sure your log gets indexed by search engines and gets back links. Put your project on Product Hunt if it is made into a product and launches. Always be launching. Give informational content that is succinct and helpful, and better than other educational content on the topic, and put that on YouTube.  Incorporate your product or at least link to it in the Description if it is indeed related, which it should be for this. reply",

What are you meant to do when you have an existing site with a brand that has inaccessible colors for the headings, buttons, links, backgrounds, text etc.? Sometimes it's not as easy as making a few colors darker/lighter, and it's a huge ask to get the client to modify their brand for this, as well as updating the styling code everywhere. reply",

          "text": "It's just people following trends I think,  designers not knowing about WCAG, and designers with decent eyesight not knowing to consider people with poor eyesight. Someone sees some elegant looking site that has grey text and/or thin text, they copy it, someone else copies that etc. without really thinking about what it's going to be like to read a long article with that design. - From my experience working with designers, many have minimal understanding of WCAG and will only adjust the contrast near the end of the design phase (as in, after the client has signed-off on it) to get it within passing limits if they're told to, and only if it's easy to do without spoiling their design. - The rules for body text are pretty simple and I'm not excusing it, but WCAG is intimidating and confusing for most I think (ask designers why they don't follow it or understand it). There's loads of rules, the documentation is verbose, and it tells you what needs to pass, but lacks guidelines on how to do this in a way that doesn't change the look of your  branded designs. - I've been in this situation as a developer a few times where I'll tell the designer what specific WCAG rules aren't being followed, and they'll not change anything because they don't know what to do without compromising their design e.g. I'll mention \"your main brand color can be used for large heading text, but it doesn't contrast enough for buttons\", where the options might include picking a darker brand color (a big ask), a darker color just for buttons (might look weird), or maybe black for buttons (will change the look a lot). - It's really common for designers to pick bright/vibrant colors for the main brand color too that won't be accessible for body/button/link text, so being told they have to pick a darker color can feel like a big unfair restriction, especially when they see large brands or the designers they follow breaking the WCAG contrast rules all the time. Also, when most brand guidelines don't include contrast metrics for recommended color pairings, you can tell this hasn't been thought about much. To help with the above, I started working on a tool to create branded color palettes, with the idea that you pick the colors for your headings, buttons, body text etc. that  have accessible contrast upfront, rather than tweaking the contrast of these as an afterthought later: https://www.inclusivecolors.com/ reply",

Before I got laid off - I was making it @ Autodesk. I have quite some experience dealing with LLM based applications - taming them into giving more sane answers. The best one that I have built so far lets you attach to any data sources (SQL/NoSQL/Files) etc and then just ask questions about them. Literally any question (even outside the schema) and it never makes up stuff. My going rate at the moment is $5 per hour (subject to complexity and my preference) - capped at 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is around $200/wk at minimum. I am very transparent about my work and I do not ask for payment beforehand and no compulsion to pay if work is not up to your standards. Also, before I take you as my client, we will do a call - this helps me to have a measure at your expectations/requirements and helps to build a bond which is something I really value. If you prefer - you could directly schedule a meet @ https://calendly.com/suvarnanarayanan2g/30min?month=2025-07 If you cannot make the slots to work for the calendar above, please shoot me an email and I will do a meet at a time you are comfortable with.

I've taken countless projects from 0 to 1 and worked for clients like JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, Rob Walling, Trello, Peter Diamandis, Syncthing, SimplyCredit and others. I'm experienced in Vue.js, Django, Phoenix framework, Quasar and many others, I've worked with most web tech stacks out there. I pick up new tech easily and like working on complex products. Case studies are on my website: https://gilli.is . I can provide the following for you: - Product Design — Whether you need a design from scratch, a redesign, or you're having issues with a small part of your product, I can design it. - Front-end Development — I can build the design into a pixel perfect product. This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort. I've worked with a wide range of frontend and backend technologies and can hit the ground running on new projects. I pick up new tech quickly, which makes it easy for me to adapt to different environments. - Analysis — Your users, know everything that's wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That's where my usability analysis comes in. I'll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback. - Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free. I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.

Email:juan.carlos@micronixsolutions.com I've had the opportunity to work as a founding engineer at multiple companies, where I've been involved in building and scaling platforms from scratch. At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails. Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon. Now it's time for something new.

I also did some c++ for various small integrations (for example some plugin for Godot, some ffmpeg, ...) and lately studying Rust. Mostly worked with GPC 70% , AWS 20%, other 10%. I like to make GUI/backends that makes sense, are easy to understand (test with users) and performant/fast. Also to last years, with minimum dependencies. I also have experience with live events setup for small broadcast of events, networking experience I did tons of remote support with people around the world, also know how to use this information to make better programs (or design...).

Engagement Style: • Part-time (24h/week) • Open to short/middle term high-impact contracts, retainers, or embedded support • Happy to mentor as part of the engagement Projects:\n• deepstream.io – Real-time messaging infrastructure (co-founder) • pikku.dev – Open-source framework for building transport-agnostic TypeScript APIs Let’s Talk: • GitHub: github.com/yasserf • LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yasserfadl • Email: yasser.fadl [at] vlandor.com reply",

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | US/Canada Remote | Toronto Hybrid I'm experimenting with a new model for CS education using advisors who follow and adapt to students' interests. The core idea is that students should learn how to learn early and to self-direct their own education. However, they need support for when they get stuck. At the moment, I'm looking to work with students who have deep interests in CS/tech, but want something more dynamic than a fixed curriculum program. Experience:\n* Self-taught programmer.\n* Worked on data engineering at a large hospital. \n* Ex-VC - worked on technology due-diligence.\n* Started independent R&D lab (www.ithron.com).\n* Designed this model based on my experiences hiring engineers. Engagement model:\n* Work with students 1 on 1\n* ideal age range is 16-21, \n* 2-3 hours of meetings per week + 15-20 hours of self-directed time\n* 3 month batches, can be extended to a full-year.\n* More info at: https://www.divepod.to Feel free to reach out at: frank [at] divepod [dot] to reply",

Whether your team is stuck troubleshooting infra issues, needs extra hands on an infra-heavy project or is just lacking tech leadership on the DevOps topics, contact me and we'll figure it out. I prefer to work along the existing engineering teams, mentoring or training them while working together on the real tasks. This is a very effective and also a flexible way to learn and as a bonus, some work gets done on the way. I am located in EU (Estonia) and work remotely with occasional on-site visits. The usual topics are various AWS services, Elastic Stack, Linux, wide range of troubleshooting, infrastructure as code, logging & monitoring, managing cloud costs, but I find it rewarding to venture into new areas together with the team.

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter.

Since around 2008, I always believed that AI research will be the most impactful technology to work on, both from an intellectual curiosity and technological capability perspective. After a few failed attempts to get into ML/AI research, I decided to apply it to quant finance, and then start an AI research lab from it. This is how Tufalabs was funded about a year ago. We started working on ARC ( https://arcprize.org/arc-agi ), and since o3 we focus on LLM-based reasoning, self-improving loops and scaling trends. You can see some of our research there: https://tufalabs.ai/blog/_site/ We do not have too many spots left, but I want to make sure we don't miss-out on people who would be great fits. We look for obsessive people who share the same research interests.\nTo apply, email me at not_a_cat at fastmail com. reply",

          "text": "I live in Australia and we have preferential voting. We also don't vote for a president but the prime minister is decided by majority of seats in house of representatives. It still ends up mostly being a 2 party thing. Supporting your team is deep rooted. However at least there is the potential for a third party to get in. But it suffers from the same statistical issue. If a quarter of voters vote green but equally across seats then that popular vote is not represented in the number of seats. It is a vote of a vote still. I wonder if we can move away from representation purely on where you live. Where you live means something. City vs. Countryside. Poor neighbourhoods vs. Rich. But if your issue is suffered by many but you don't all cluster together in latitude and longitude then that issue has less weight. Sorry forgot this is who's hiring! reply",

It’s very much a system level strategy, but more by way of democratized technology as opposed to head on disruption. I asked the same questions when I joined. We want to provide powerful technology to candidates that are not going to be supported by the two main parties. And we have some other qualifications, like not taking corporate money. The more that independent candidates can succeed and win, the more we normalize the electorate expecting something that isn’t just to two main parties. In a way, it’s the electorate that we are trying to empower by supporting viable alternatives to the current system. I’m glad there is interest in what we’re doing. I think we are on track too, making increasing impacts and I am excited about our growing team. reply",

Code is not a piece of art its a plumbing behind the scenes. It doesn’t has to be fancy and elegant. But it must be effective and both easy and cheap to maintain. 3. Most engineers engineer for the sake of it, and this leads to a mess. 4. Most important code quality metrics is a team scalability. Optimizing code for maintainability and simplicity is way more important and profitable than optimizing for anything else. I think as with any taste it can’t be learned explicitly. It’s an accumulation of many real world examples of good and bad decisions. But something you can accelerate by jumping on a harder problems and diving into larger projects. reply",

I do a lot of programming, usually in Python and C++, and with a mathematical or algorithmic focus. For example, as part of my research I developed a BDD library that uses complexity theory to guarantee correctness with small overhead. Or recently, in my spare time, I created an AI for MTG (drafting, to be precise), using a transformer architecture with PyTorch. I am very enthusiastic about using or coming up with theoretical ideas that can improve outcomes in practice. I rely on having strong fundamentals, from mathematics over algorithms to knowledge of the actual hardware, to enable me to easily pick up new areas and tackle novel problems. Most of my research is the result of collaborations — it is important to me to both support my colleagues and be able to learn from them. Please feel free to refer to my CV for more detailed information, or my website ( https://nicze.de/philipp/ ). Currently, I am very interested in AI, but I am also happy to discuss any other interesting opportunities! reply",

Email: nathaniel.bennett@gmail.com My name is Nate Bennett. I reside Thousand Oaks, Ca with my beautiful wife of almost 15yrs and 3 children. I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs. As a former professional athlete, I am looking to join a team where teamwork is paramount and opportunities for growth and learning from others are a daily occurrence. I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding. Away from the computer I enjoy working out in my garage gym, playing guitar, and playing outside with my kids. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

          "text": "To be clear, your work is next level awesome and technically more sophisticated than anything I've done. Mine is Javascript based and essentially a sprite screen graph rendering engine mixed with pixel-level effects on top of canvas, with an isometric endless world platform for runners and RPGs built on top of that renderer. I did ship one game with it, back in 2016. Since then, I've relegated my commercial work in that vein to threejs and pixijs. It sounds counterintuitive, but using your own codebase like this to develop a finished commercial product inevitably forces you to pollute the purity of the code. You start to develop sets of features that are specific to the game's needs and which force compromises that shear it away from being a general-purpose green field engine. Do I still dream of the day when I finish a new game built on my own codebase....? Totally. But maintaining a game in production and not having its needs override the intent of keeping a general purpose engone is like 4x times the work. reply",

          "text": "After 2+ years of maintaining the FOSS lightweight Reddit frontend Redlib [0], I realized that my niche but extremely detailed knowledge and experience of using Reddit's endpoints might be useful. After reverse engineering the mobile app and writing code to emulate nearly every aspect of its behavior, plus writing a codegen framework that will auto-update my code from analyzing the behavior from an Android emulator, I can pretty easily replay common user flows from any IP around the world, collecting and extracting the data. Some use cases: * OSINT (r00m101 just beat me to it by launching...) * Research into recommendation algorithms, advertising placement algorithms, etc * Marketing (ad libraries, detailed analysis of content given data not even exposed to the mobile app due to some interesting side channels, things like trend analysis, etc) * Market research for products * Sales teams can use it to find exact mentions of other products. Eg: selling crash reporting software? Look up your target accounts' brands and find examples of complaints. Plus a few more with more imagination. So I'm working on a site that allows user access to some of the read-only functions available here. Coming soon :tm:. Been really fun building it all in Rust, though :) If you're interested in anything here, email in profile. [0]: https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib reply",

          "text": "Years ago I was making a diagram editor with the intent of doing code generation from diagrams (like simulink, not stateflow). I started with splines for the connections and decided straight lines and junctions would be better for complex diagrams. I realized that a better way to internally define the connecting wires is via a set of lines and their connectivity (vs their endpoint coordinates). Imagine each line segment is defined by a direction (vertical or horizontal) and a position (perpendicular distance from the origin) Like ax+by=d where a and b are either 0 or 1. You also need to define which other lines it connects to. Given the list of connections you can then calculate the intersections at rendering time. By sorting the list of connections you can render the line without features at the start and end, and then draw junctions for any intermediate connections. The beauty of this would be to allow dragging blocks around and having the lines follow with the junctions passing through each other as needed. There is some housekeeping with this data structure (merging colinear segments that connect, breaking segments when needed) but the UI for dragging should be much better than anything out there. reply",

Nether had any performance issues with a few minor exceptions on Immich (I don't recall anything from PhotoPrism but it has been a while now since I switched) 1. The Immich app's performance is awful. It is a well known problem and their current focus. I have pretty high confidence that it will be fixed within a few months. Web app is totally fine though. 2. Some background operations such as AI indexing, face detection and video conversion don't work gracefully when restarted from scratch. They all basically first delete all the old data, then start processing assets. So for many days (depending on your parallelism settings and server performance) you may be completely missing some assets from search or converted videos. But you only need to do this very rarely (change encoding settings and want to apply to the back catalog or switch AI search model). I don't upload at a particularly high rate but my sever can very easy handle the steady state. 1 is pretty major but being worked on and you can work around it by just opening the website. 2 is less important but I don't think there is any work on it. reply",

Haven't tried it for face recognition, but if you already have identified someone in one photo, it can probably tell you if the person in that photo is also in another photo Just one caveat, if you are processing thousands of pictures, it will take a while to process them all (depending on your hardware and picture size). You could also try creating a processing pipeline, first extracting faces or bounding boxes of the faces with something like opencv, and then passing those to gemma3 Please post repo link if you ever decide to open source reply",

          "text": "I've been running Nextcloud in Docker with the Recognize and Memories apps for about a year and half now. It's in an off-lease refurbished Dell Precision tower from 2018. I'm using docker compose to include some supporting containers like go-vod (for hardware transcoding), another nextcloud instance to handle push notifications to the clients, and redis (for caching).  I can share some more details, foibles and pitfalls if you'd like. I initiated a rescan last week, which stacks background jobs in a queue that gets called by cron 2 or 3 times a day. Recognize has been cranking through 10k-20k photos per day, with good results. I've installed a desktop client on my dad's laptop so he can dump all of the family hard drives we've accumulated over the years. The client does a good job of clearing up disk space after uploading, which is a huge advantage in my setup. My dad has used the OneDrive client before, so he was able to pick up this process very quickly. Nextcloud also has a decent mobile client that can auto-upload photos and videos, which I recently used to help my mother-in-law upload media from her 7-year-old iPhone. reply",

          "text": "Memories and Recognize work fine with the base Nextcloud docker image. My host has a GPU so I use go-vod to leverage hardware transcoding. The base NC docker image can't access Nvidia cards (probably other GPUs as well). I could script in a way to do this but would need to run it after each update. Recognize runs fine on my CPU so I haven't explored this yet. I have an OpenMediaVault VM with a 10tb volume in the network that runs the S3 plugin (Minio-based) which is connected through Nextcloud's external storage feature (I want to migrate to Garage soon). I believe notify_push helps desktop clients cut down on the chatter when querying the external storage folder. Limiting the users that can access this also helps. I was having issues getting the notify_push app [1] to work in the container with my reverse-proxy. I found some similar setups that did this [2], so I added another nextcloud container to the docker-compose yaml like so: notify_push:\n    image: nextcloud\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - 7867:7867\n    depends_on:\n      - app\n    environment:\n      - PORT=7867\n      - NEXTCLOUD_URL=http://<local ip address of docker server>:8081\n    entrypoint: /var/www/html/custom_apps/notify_push/bin/x86_64/notify_push /var/www/html/config/config.php\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/nextcloud/customapps:/var/www/html/custom_apps\n      - /path/to/nextcloud/config:/var/www/html/config [1] - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/notify_push [2] - https://help.nextcloud.com/t/docker-caddy-fpm-notify-push-ca... reply",

Stock NC gets you a very solid general purpose document management system and with a few addons, you basically get self hosted SharePoint and OneDrive without the baggage. The images/pictures side of things has seen quite a lot of development and with some addons you get image classification with fairly minimal effort. The system as a whole will quite happily handle many 100,000 files with pretty rubbish hardware, if you are happy to wait for batch jobs to run or you throw more hardware at it and speed up the job schedules. NC has a stock phone app which works very well these days, including camera folder uploads.  There are several more apps that integrate with the main one to add optional functionality.  For example notes and voip. It is a very large and mature setup with loads of documentation and hence extensible by a determined hacker if something is missing. reply",

          "text": "> How do I sell my SaaS to SMBs and large corporations when they don't even reply. If that's your target, then you might possibly be operating under at least a few wrong assumptions. As they say, you always want to sell to stakeholders. In large orgs, most people you can talk to just earn a salary. If you're selling time, money, or savings for the org , they're rarely interested. What usually holds their attention are magicians that offer to make their problems disappear . You're trying to sell a DIY kit to companies where, past a certain size, the type of competency required becomes a rare commodity in-house (regardless of how ridiculously simple the solution). So they typically avoid upgrading themselves into new problems. Integrating a SaaS is always a new problem. In addition to selling the tools to solve their problems, can you also offer to sell the service that makes them go away? Can you be the magician that makes entire problems disappear? What if you told them you'll take them away for a fee, could that get their attention? Try it and see if it at least gets the conversation going. If it does, you can lay out a price table where you charge a premium to hire a few people to work on it with your own tools. reply",

          "text": "People don't reply because they don't feel the pain you remove. Timing is everything. You can monitor socials for individuals complaining about the pain point or about a competitor and reach out when you got a proper \"signal\". I also avoid saying things like \"free trial\". Instead, I offer to give them access to the paid product to try it out. It sounds less car salesman-y and as a receiver it feels nicer to get access to a paid product rather than a free trial everyone can have. Semantics most of the time, but it helps. You can write organic content about how to solve those pains (and hope people searching for solutions find it). When you do get customers you should always include a form that asks _why_ they are unsubscribing. I have learned a lot from it and it also offers a chance to turn customers back around. If someone complains about the price, I can give them a discounted rate. If someone complains about a specific quality issue I can give them free credits to make up for used ones, etc. Always respond quickly. I have landed many customers simply because I respond quickly to emails. I've had customers tell me they chose my service over \"big competitor Y\" because I respond to their emails (even though my service is more expensive). If you have an entire vertical, don't undervalue the small fish. I target ~3 different types of customers and the bulk of my revenue comes from one specific type of customer. I almost got rid of the other two customers, but realized my largest customer ($1XX,XXX/year) started off as a small fish for a year before becoming a big fish. That may go against some of the traditional advice, as the small fish tend to account for most of the support... but in my case it works out. A lot of the small customers end up being a channel on their own. A person leaves company A and goes to company B. They introduce your product at company B because they used it at company A. When I speak with people I always ask how they found out about my product. Nine times out of ten it's a \"coworker used your product at a different company\". reply",

With that assumption: Marketing became much more important than it used to be. I used to be able to rely on organic growth from people finding my SaaS using search engines. But this ended several years ago. Marketing also became much more difficult than it used to be. Generic ads on Google or LinkedIn no longer work, unless you can spend huge amounts of money on testing. I found all paid ads to be a waste of money. If you have a B2B SaaS, you run into the additional problem of people being busy and not hanging out in forums. With consumers, things are more straightforward. You can generally blast an ad on Reddit, Instagram, and some other sites, and people will see it. Not so with B2B. Many of your customers will be busy working, and they will not pay any attention to work-related ads outside of work. Content marketing also became more difficult. With search engines, especially Google, going down the drain and the deluge of crappy SEO-gaming and AI-generated content, it's difficult to rise above the noise. I haven't found the right solution yet. reply",

          "text": "I faced the same problem myself — traffic was the main issue. Even if the product is great, it won’t matter unless people can actually find it. Another thing I realized: the intended user and the actual user can be very different. In my case, I built an app called foundersmail.xyz, which gives users access to founders' official emails and other details. I got the idea after seeing someone else build a similar tool for investors — it worked well for him, but he already had an audience and reputation. For me, I promoted it across various subreddits and platforms and got around 100 users. I noticed that only 20–30% actually used up their free credits. While debugging this, I discovered most of my users were students cold-emailing founders for summer internships. I thought at least one of them might convert — but unfortunately, none did (still trying to figure that part out). My two biggest mistakes: No traffic — not enough eyeballs. Target audience mismatch — students using it instead of founders or professionals. Interestingly, there are competitors making money with similar products, so I know there’s potential. I’m still figuring out what’s missing in my approach. That said, I’m okay with the outcome so far. I haven’t spent a single rupee — free domain, free hosting, and I built it in my spare time and vibe coded. It was an experiment rather than an actual business. reply",

I know I could improve onboarding, I could record videos showing how to use more advanced features etc. Chances are you could do more marketing and you could improve onboarding in your app but to give you specific, actionable advice we would have to know much more about your app, your competitors, your marketing efforts.

          "text": "Are you selling top down or bottom up? That makes a world of difference. Top down means you’re trying to sell managers and above who don’t directly use the tool. Usually they care about seeing case studies, logos of other companies, testimonials from their peers, etc. They want to look good and the way you help them with that is making one of their metrics look good, or giving them more budget to work with. Safe decisions are easier for them to make because they don’t want to get fired by making a risky bet, even if the risky bet offers more for less (“nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM”). Usually the way in with them is through partnerships, relationships, and education. Start with friends who work in that industry to get you a case study and logo or you could try to make friends at a conference if you don’t have any already. Or create some educational material around the problem and sell them consulting, using your tool as a solution. Almost always this starts off as more consultative as a relationship. If it’s bottom up, you’re selling to the individual contributors who don’t get a say about paying for the tool. That means you have to start with a generous free tier and try to get as many seats filled or usage as possible. It should bring enough value to the ICs and the organization that by the time they hit their usage caps in the free tier, the ICs are begging their managers to put a credit card in or asking to set up a sales call. If you’re not getting any usage at the free tier, then it comes back to finding where the ICs hang out and trying to integrate your tool as part of a workflow to common problems they solve. This is again about educating and making/leaning on friends to help spread the word and convince others to use your tool. In both cases, relationships matter a lot to get initial traction (existing customers, friends in the industry, partners). They will help you figure out what’s needed to sell into the market you want to sell into, what’s holding you back, and getting you early validation. I didn’t see you mention existing relationships you have, so maybe that’s a good place to start. reply",

So if your competition is killing it, and you are not getting bites on your added value, you need to talk to people to find out what pains they still have even when using your competitor's solution, and then make sure your added value resolves those pains. Otherwise, you've got the same solution, just a shinier version, and that is all your 1:1 feature comparison will show. There is a big caveat on this that we have no idea what product or feature set you are talking about, so this is pure speculation.

I've had an app get thousands of views based on a reddit post, and not one person (literally 0) bothered to click outside of the page (i.e. were curious what app this is). Social media is a false sense of validation, even if you get a hit. Direct sales is the only thing that I found that works consistently. Get in front of anyone in this organization. My guess is you're trying to do too direct so you send a spammy email telling them how great your product is. Don't do that. Don't try to sell them anything. Don't even tell them you have a product. Just get them on a zoom call and ask them what they do now and why it sucks. People are much more receptive to take a call and tell you about what they do or their problems than they are to hear a sales pitch. reply",

And I'm a principal IC, but still IC, so mostly wasted effort on their part. Every last email gets deleted unread after I report it as spam to our spam filters. I'm sure I've deleted at least one email that could have actually been something worth investigating, but who has the time for all that? And realistically, I know what my pain points are, we talk about them all the time and actively search for solutions, but budget, reluctance of decision makers, etc often gets in the way, or the solution is too expensive compared to the actual difficulties. Not that something revolutionary can't come along, but ya, its essentially all spam. I also do the same with anyone that cold emails or calls me - 99% look to be a waste of time. When we still worked in an office you'd hear the telephones ring across the office one by one, as the robocaller worked through the extensions. Many ended up turning the ringer off, because otherwise it is an onslaught that is far more disruptive than whatever pain point they might actually be able to solve.

          "text": "I’m going to tell you something from the other side… A few jobs ago, I worked for a struggling startup that was trying to pivot and we had one large customer that kept the lights on.  I was over the project that kept the lights on and survived every round of layoffs. The customer was hesitant about giving a small struggling startup money and made us put our code in escrow that they would have access to under certain conditions.  The startup failed, they got the code and the company that acquired us for scraps added an addendum to my severance agreement that released me from my non compete and allowed me to have access to  my work laptops and work for the client. A few years later I was the dev lead at another company and I found the perfect SaaS product for our needs.  But the CTO wasn’t comfortable basing our entire project around a one man startup.  I suggested an escrow agreement, the lawyers got  involved and we signed the contract and we were now 80% of his business. I’m not suggesting you so an escrow.  I am saying that many businesses aren’t going to trust a no name one person startup until you have some referenceable clients, provide an easy migration path if you go tits up and they know you aren’t a fly by night company. Personally, I’m in the camp of “no one ever got fired for buying $WellKnownIndustryStandardProduct” But I don’t have too much actionable advice when it comes to top of the funnel sales.  I’m a “post sales architect” as part of my job.  The next step below sales. reply",

          "text": "So here’s the rub. Your product is almost irrelevant, as long as it is at least mediocre at what it does. What matters is your marketing and your positioning. From how you describe it, it sounds like you’re selling steak, not the sizzle - you say what it is capable of but not what it does for you. You mention that it could save “ten hours for real”, and this is the point you need to drive home - this will save you money, make you money, make you more attractive to investors, give you time and peace of mind . As to channels - social media rules the roost. Pay YouTube and TikTok influencers to shill for you. If you don’t believe enough in your product to pay for marketing, why should they believe in it? Push out hype-laden press releases. Thump your chest. Drop emails to journalists in the space, with pre-written soundbites and a link to the release. Make it easy content for them to sling up on their platform. The bar is low . Pick a vertical. Work it, target it, saturate it with your product. If you can find a vertical that’s underserved, then start there. Finally, make sure your landing page speaks to the above, and hammers the point home right out of the gate. “Vidlify will help you get that Ferrari you always wanted. Here’s how:” Save jargon for the “I’m excited, tell me more”. Then, either it will fly, and you can progress to a broader market, or it won’t, and you either accept your loss and move on, or tweak and try again - but don’t get caught in the sunk costs fallacy - just because you’ve already spent X time and Y money, it doesn’t mean you have to commit more.

          "text": "Yours is not the first post asking about this here.  Which in and of itself says something. I don't use them, at all.  I briefly tried the local tab completion stuff offered in JetBrains products.  It lasted an hour or two.  The log messages it wrote didn't sound like me, and the \"copilot pause\" was immediately frustrating. The boilerplate argument comes up a lot, but I really don't see it as the huge issue that would drive me to try and make Clippy generate it for me.  That sort of \"boring\" work is great for \"meditating\" on the thing you're doing.  Spending time adjacent to the problem putting up the scaffolding makes you mentally examine the places where things are going to interact and gives that little seed of an idea time to grow a bit.  Become more robust. Later, when there's an issue, you can ask the human that wrote something questions about it and they will probably have at least a fuzzy recollection of how it was built (and why it was done that way) that can offer ideas.  Best you can do is hope the LLM doesn't hallucinate when you ask it about all the broken stuff. Ultimately I see neither value nor \"power\" in the current \"assistants.\"  They generate the  statistically most median output and often get it wrong.  They make stuff up.  They have no understanding of anything, and they don't learn from mistakes.  If they were a person you'd be asking serious, but nearly rhetorical, questions about whether or not to fire them. reply",

Figure out where people who would want to use your project hang out online.  Share it there (if those places allow sharing projects and don't have a policy against it). Offer helpful advice in subreddits, Discords, Telegram, and other channels where people who would like your project hang out.  Don't spam your project, but do keep your project link in your profile, so that people who are really impressed by your helpfulness check it out, they will see it. If you have $, maybe see what people search for who would be interested in your project, and experiment with Google, Meta, or other (AI?) ad platforms.  But start small, it is easy to spend a lot. Or else just write prolifically about it.  Once a day/week/month, make sure your log gets indexed by search engines and gets back links. Put your project on Product Hunt if it is made into a product and launches. Always be launching. Give informational content that is succinct and helpful, and better than other educational content on the topic, and put that on YouTube.  Incorporate your product or at least link to it in the Description if it is indeed related, which it should be for this. reply",

Safford Jr.'s robotics books, 'The Complete Handbook of Robotics' (1978) and 'Handbook of Advanced Robotics' (1982), both published by TAB Books, as the most likely candidates for the remembered book. The descriptions of these books align well with the user's memory of complex, pen-and-ink robot illustrations. reply",

          "text": "... and: I've identified several prominent DIY electronics magazines from the early 1980s in the US. The most promising candidates, based on the user's description, are 'Popular Electronics' and 'Byte'. 'Popular Electronics' was a highly circulated magazine that even inspired the founding of Microsoft, and it transitioned into 'Computers & Electronics' in 1982. 'Byte' was a leading computer magazine that often featured electronics content and was known for its distinctive cover art by Robert Tinney. Other magazines like 'Radio Electronics Magazine', 'Nuts and Volts', 'Elektor Electronics Magazine', 'Practical Electronics', 'Circuit Cellar', 'Silicon Chip Magazine', and 'Hobby Electronics' were also noted, but 'Popular Electronics' and 'Byte' seem to be the strongest fits for the US context and time frame. reply",

Later I implemented the classic guessing-game \"I'm thinking of a number\", \"that was too high\", \"that was too low\", and we talked about choosing the number in the middle: https://github.com/skx/gobasic/blob/master/examples/55-game.... Later still things got more interesting when he could both type but also read, and I implemented a simple text-based adventure game for him to play with: https://github.com/skx/lighthouse-of-doom/ As for him using the computer?  Nowdays he watches videos of minecraft stuff on youtube, but has zero interest in coding, experimenting, or learning how it works. That's fine, he's not me and he can have his own interests.  That's my takeaway from doing computer-stuff at a young age: Not all children care about computer-stuff. reply",

That’s before social media, before ubiquitous data, before smartphones, before streaming. Your job is to grow as much as your child so you can support them when they start having adultish problems; can just stop following your agenda; and the only tool on your toolbelt is being the kind of person they want to be around. Screen time is rounding error on the quality of parenting. Stop arguing on the internet. It is pretend work. reply",

In some cases the things I loved the most at the time ended up setting me back as much as a decade in maturity (i.e. gaming addiction), which is relentlessly pursued by most companies in the space today. I don't intend to raise or coddle my children in such a way as to have them become infantile hopelessly dependent adults, and in many cases today as a parent you have to be ruthless when it comes to cutting out malign influences. I have friends who have children, and they've taken similar spartan approaches to great effect. Their children read, think, and comprehend material at a much higher level than their peers. reply",

          "text": "It's just people following trends I think,  designers not knowing about WCAG, and designers with decent eyesight not knowing to consider people with poor eyesight. Someone sees some elegant looking site that has grey text and/or thin text, they copy it, someone else copies that etc. without really thinking about what it's going to be like to read a long article with that design. - From my experience working with designers, many have minimal understanding of WCAG and will only adjust the contrast near the end of the design phase (as in, after the client has signed-off on it) to get it within passing limits if they're told to, and only if it's easy to do without spoiling their design. - The rules for body text are pretty simple and I'm not excusing it, but WCAG is intimidating and confusing for most I think (ask designers why they don't follow it or understand it). There's loads of rules, the documentation is verbose, and it tells you what needs to pass, but lacks guidelines on how to do this in a way that doesn't change the look of your  branded designs. - I've been in this situation as a developer a few times where I'll tell the designer what specific WCAG rules aren't being followed, and they'll not change anything because they don't know what to do without compromising their design e.g. I'll mention \"your main brand color can be used for large heading text, but it doesn't contrast enough for buttons\", where the options might include picking a darker brand color (a big ask), a darker color just for buttons (might look weird), or maybe black for buttons (will change the look a lot). - It's really common for designers to pick bright/vibrant colors for the main brand color too that won't be accessible for body/button/link text, so being told they have to pick a darker color can feel like a big unfair restriction, especially when they see large brands or the designers they follow breaking the WCAG contrast rules all the time. Also, when most brand guidelines don't include contrast metrics for recommended color pairings, you can tell this hasn't been thought about much. To help with the above, I started working on a tool to create branded color palettes, with the idea that you pick the colors for your headings, buttons, body text etc. that  have accessible contrast upfront, rather than tweaking the contrast of these as an afterthought later: https://www.inclusivecolors.com/ reply",

          "text": "Being employed in four companies is obviously not sustainable, but half of that is fairly common. I know several people who spent months working for two companies: one full time, the other part time. The most productive few would reach two full time positions and actually keep delivering for over a year. The reason this happens at all is that sufficiently large organisations expect performance to be in a specific range - if it's too low you'll be fired, but going the extra mile will not yield benefits, as your compensation is decided by the assigned budget and promotions are rare. Case in point: a few years ago my former co-worker was given \"overtime\" which was actually a hidden raise, as management really wanted to keep him, but couldn't officially increase his compensation. The organisation for which we worked eventually cracked down on such practices, so he left to work at a place which would compensate him this much and more without resorting to such tricks. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

Other states might be different, but stuff you do outside of work doesn't automatically become your employer's IP in California. There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.  That's relevant to the discussion at hand because, at least in California, you could work from home for two companies with unrelated businesses and not break any rules. reply",

It also drags everyone else down. The team figures out what's going on. They get tired of adjusting their communication around the one person who's always distracted and doing something else. Basically, it turns into a lot of work for everyone else to get work out of the OE person. Like they can do good work, but they're going to make everyone else work hard to extract it from them because they're busy juggling multiple jobs.

Work with in-demand tools - for me that's .NET, React, Azure, SQL dbs etc. For others it may be go, python, java, AWS, GCP whatever is in demand near you. Probably not Rust, C or C++ etc - I'm  sure there's demand for that too but at least near me they're a lot rarer. Some people do well working with obscure stuff like cobol and Delphi etc, but I wouldn't really recommend that unless it kind of just falls in your lap somehow. Web development is pretty big, if you can work full stack even better. At least that's what I do, and I don't have any trouble getting jobs. If you struggle with simple interview questions, work on fundamentals. All my technical interviews have been quite easy but the interviewers have been very impressed. This tells me most devs have poor understanding of programming fundamentals. Being able to do well at interviews is not that hard and it opens a lot of doors. Things like advent of code, codewars etc are good practice. Maybe dust off your old DS&A book and go through it again. A good DSA understanding will help you in your daily work as well, it's not just about interviews. You're not supposed to memorize algorithms, you're supposed to understand them, understand what makes some algorithms faster than others, understand how to use different data structures to improve your algorithms. Understand how to judge the performance of an algorithm just by reading it (big O and such). It's extremely useful and important, I use this knowledge on a daily basis and it helps me do well in interviews. Also be good with databases. The database is the core of an application, it can and should do most of the heavy lifting. An API is basically just an adapter between a frontend and a db. reply",

          "text": "> And it’s “free” only because I would pay more in taxes I see it like this: it's a spectrum. At one end of it, you have the idealistic communism: \"we all get the same treatment\" (I know, it's more complicated than that). Which means that you definitely won't be homeless with no perspective, but you won't be mega rich. At the other end, you could have no government and let people pay for everything. No roads, no schools. The mega rich would be fine: they would build their own private roads where it matters, move with a helicopter, and their children anyway will have some kind of private teacher. But the average population is worse off, and the poor even worse. If you go too much towards that second end (all for the mega rich), you risk a \"revolution\": if enough people have nothing to lose, they will hunt down the mega rich. Everybody loses. Obviously, if you are part of the population that is today privileged, you may be happy with an unequal society (because you benefit from it). So if your goal is to be in a better situation than most of the population, and if you can achieve that, then you're better off in the US. Now not everyone is like that. Some people like it if the average population lives better, eats better, is better educated, better informed, less polarised, ... And in that sense, the US is not remotely at the top of the list. Yes, I pay more taxes than I would if I was in the US, where I could create my own safety net. But that's a feature, not a bug. If I earn more than the average person, I'm happy to contribute more to the public infrastructure, because I can. > And many countries in Europe are very much polarized if you are a Black person Of course there is racism everywhere, not sure what you were expecting when you searched for that link. But I'm pretty sure it's worse in the US. > And you 2/3rds consider themselves Christian - about the same as the US. It's not about that, again. You can consider yourself a Christian and not be anti-abortion, for instance. Again, the US is worse than many European countries in many regards there. > I think the countries policies suck on a lot of levels and much of the population is overly religious, bigoted, and naive and cheering as their Dear Leader is taking away services they need just because he “owns the libs”. For many people, that's enough of a reason to prefer other countries. > And by stable economic policies do you mean “stagnant”? The EU couldn’t innovate its way out of wet paper bag. This is something where most Americans are simply ignorant. Do you know why the US economy is better? Access to fossil fuels. When you have more energy, you have more money and you can \"innovate\" more. But \"innovation\" is not representative of quality of life. The US \"innovates\" with a lot of bullshit, or downright destructive technology. As long as is makes money, it's considered that it is good for society in the US. In Europe it's different (whether it's a choice or not, it does not matter). Europe does a lot of great things that contribute to society. If it improves society but doesn't print money, usually it stays in Europe. If the innovation has the potential to print money, usually it gets bought by the US (under some form, being just by having VC money available for that kind of technology). Before saying \"we in America invented all the modern technology\", you should inform yourself a tiny bit, and realise that actually, a lot of it comes from the rest of the world. America is really good at making money in an unequal society (meaning that those innovations actually serve making the rich richer and the poor poorer). Not saying that you should hate the US and love the rest of the world. What I'm trying to say is that many Americans believe that the US is the best country in the world, and more importantly that the rest of the world believes it as well . And that is very wrong: the American lifestyle is not desirable for a whole lot of people. Maybe it used to be in the last century, but not anymore. Not at all. reply",

There won’t be a revolution because poor rural America is happy as long as Trump mistreats immigrants and non straight  (and especially trans)  people and as long as he protects Jews because they believe if Isreal doesn’t exist, Jesus won’t have a place to come back to (no exaggeration). No I don’t have any opinion one way or the other about Isreal vs Palestine. The American people and especially the poor who overwhelmingly voted for Trump this time are going to get exactly what they voted for. I would be more than happy for my taxes to support education, universal healthcare, fully funded pre-K, a better safety net etc. I wouldn’t have a problem if my stock returns decreased slightly because corporations paid more taxes to help  a better safety net. But on the other hand I did move to state tax free (and warm) Florida when I started working remotely post 2020 and save a good chunk each year. Why wouldn’t I take advantage of the arbitrage of being on the other side of inequality and make as much money as possible, keep 12 months expenses in savings outside of retirement savings and stack money? I vote for politicians who probably wouldn’t treat me as favorably as far as taxes to help pull others up. The only people who believe America is the objectively best country are those who are on the other side of income gap like me and those who haven’t actually been anywhere else for any length of time and don’t realize how ridiculous for instance the American health care system\nis. My wife and I have done the digital nomad thing domestically from late 2022-late 2023 only coming home to Florida for Jan-February. Starting next year, we are going to spend a few months in Costa Rica and/or  Panama City every year.  I know how good and affordable the public health care system is there (caja) and even paying out of pocket is feasible for many things for health tourism.

My point was that if you're not part of those benefitting from that, or if you don't actually want to live in a country that values this lifestyle, then that's a reason to move to another country. And many many countries are better than the US if you \"don't mostly care about money\", if I can say it like that.

Before I got laid off - I was making it @ Autodesk. I have quite some experience dealing with LLM based applications - taming them into giving more sane answers. The best one that I have built so far lets you attach to any data sources (SQL/NoSQL/Files) etc and then just ask questions about them. Literally any question (even outside the schema) and it never makes up stuff. My going rate at the moment is $5 per hour (subject to complexity and my preference) - capped at 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is around $200/wk at minimum. I am very transparent about my work and I do not ask for payment beforehand and no compulsion to pay if work is not up to your standards. Also, before I take you as my client, we will do a call - this helps me to have a measure at your expectations/requirements and helps to build a bond which is something I really value. If you prefer - you could directly schedule a meet @ https://calendly.com/suvarnanarayanan2g/30min?month=2025-07 If you cannot make the slots to work for the calendar above, please shoot me an email and I will do a meet at a time you are comfortable with.

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | USA | Remote is fine (I'm also considering relocation to Chicago or NYC, maybe SF) I'm a jack-of-all-trades software engineer who's done extensive \"founding engineer\" work in the context of both VC-backed startups and for smaller contract gigs over a period of about 10 years. I have strong technical foundations, good product sense, and have gone deep with AI/LLM tech both in the sense of being able to use it effectively, and in exploring the design space for products/tools leveraging it. Tools I use most frequently these days: Typescript, node, React, pnpm+vite. I've also done extensive work with three.js in the past. I used to write a lot of Java and a bit of Objective C, have dabbled in Rust and Elixir. I've done a lot of work in developer tools and data visualization of various kinds. Data-rich, non-traditional UIs with highly optimized UX, and rapid prototyping are my forte.

I've taken countless projects from 0 to 1 and worked for clients like JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, Rob Walling, Trello, Peter Diamandis, Syncthing, SimplyCredit and others. I'm experienced in Vue.js, Django, Phoenix framework, Quasar and many others, I've worked with most web tech stacks out there. I pick up new tech easily and like working on complex products. Case studies are on my website: https://gilli.is . I can provide the following for you: - Product Design — Whether you need a design from scratch, a redesign, or you're having issues with a small part of your product, I can design it. - Front-end Development — I can build the design into a pixel perfect product. This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort. I've worked with a wide range of frontend and backend technologies and can hit the ground running on new projects. I pick up new tech quickly, which makes it easy for me to adapt to different environments. - Analysis — Your users, know everything that's wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That's where my usability analysis comes in. I'll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback. - Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free. I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.

At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails. Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue.

I also did some c++ for various small integrations (for example some plugin for Godot, some ffmpeg, ...) and lately studying Rust. Mostly worked with GPC 70% , AWS 20%, other 10%. I like to make GUI/backends that makes sense, are easy to understand (test with users) and performant/fast. Also to last years, with minimum dependencies. I also have experience with live events setup for small broadcast of events, networking experience I did tons of remote support with people around the world, also know how to use this information to make better programs (or design...).

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | US/Canada Remote | Toronto Hybrid I'm experimenting with a new model for CS education using advisors who follow and adapt to students' interests. The core idea is that students should learn how to learn early and to self-direct their own education. However, they need support for when they get stuck. At the moment, I'm looking to work with students who have deep interests in CS/tech, but want something more dynamic than a fixed curriculum program. Experience:\n* Self-taught programmer.\n* Worked on data engineering at a large hospital. \n* Ex-VC - worked on technology due-diligence.\n* Started independent R&D lab (www.ithron.com).\n* Designed this model based on my experiences hiring engineers. Engagement model:\n* Work with students 1 on 1\n* ideal age range is 16-21, \n* 2-3 hours of meetings per week + 15-20 hours of self-directed time\n* 3 month batches, can be extended to a full-year.\n* More info at: https://www.divepod.to Feel free to reach out at: frank [at] divepod [dot] to reply",

Whether your team is stuck troubleshooting infra issues, needs extra hands on an infra-heavy project or is just lacking tech leadership on the DevOps topics, contact me and we'll figure it out. I prefer to work along the existing engineering teams, mentoring or training them while working together on the real tasks. This is a very effective and also a flexible way to learn and as a bonus, some work gets done on the way. I am located in EU (Estonia) and work remotely with occasional on-site visits. The usual topics are various AWS services, Elastic Stack, Linux, wide range of troubleshooting, infrastructure as code, logging & monitoring, managing cloud costs, but I find it rewarding to venture into new areas together with the team.

We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots. Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot's position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on. Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 60 people and we're growing rapidly to meet demand.

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

It still ends up mostly being a 2 party thing. Supporting your team is deep rooted. However at least there is the potential for a third party to get in. But it suffers from the same statistical issue. If a quarter of voters vote green but equally across seats then that popular vote is not represented in the number of seats. It is a vote of a vote still. I wonder if we can move away from representation purely on where you live. Where you live means something. City vs. Countryside. Poor neighbourhoods vs. Rich. But if your issue is suffered by many but you don't all cluster together in latitude and longitude then that issue has less weight. Sorry forgot this is who's hiring! reply",

          "text": "no mention of any system-level strategy on the website. this may as well be another lobbying group. pumping more candidates (even good ones) into a busted system is like increasing the flow rate into a cracked bucket. good metrics showing how much more is going in, with little attention paid to how much is flowing out. i do appreciate the ambition to change things at a higher level, but there is nothing resembling significant disruption here. my suggestion would be to identify a single, core point of systemic leverage that can actually make a demonstrable change to the way things operate (i.e. patch the bucket or, better still, replace it). for example, if you can get a sensible cap put on the amount of funds that can be given in support of a political campaign (yeah, i know, good luck with that) or can instigate a nationwide movement for proportional representation, or tie up the practice of gerrymandering, that might get momentum for a bigger step. i'm sure there is lots i don't know about the role and potential for independents in the US (i live elsewhere), but the principle still holes that a problem must be solved by a higher level of complexity than the one that created it. so i implore you, don't stop what you are doing, but try to find the next step up into systems thinking or, even better, meta-systematic strategy, which is actually what is needed for serious political reform. there are, of course, many ways to shoot down my argument, and it is true to some extent that 'policy is personnel', but the level of systemic failure evidenced in recent years makes me think that such an initiative, while valuable in itself, cannot flourish in the way it needs to in order to be effective reply",

It’s very much a system level strategy, but more by way of democratized technology as opposed to head on disruption. I asked the same questions when I joined. We want to provide powerful technology to candidates that are not going to be supported by the two main parties. And we have some other qualifications, like not taking corporate money. The more that independent candidates can succeed and win, the more we normalize the electorate expecting something that isn’t just to two main parties. In a way, it’s the electorate that we are trying to empower by supporting viable alternatives to the current system. I’m glad there is interest in what we’re doing. I think we are on track too, making increasing impacts and I am excited about our growing team. reply",

Since around 2008, I always believed that AI research will be the most impactful technology to work on, both from an intellectual curiosity and technological capability perspective. After a few failed attempts to get into ML/AI research, I decided to apply it to quant finance, and then start an AI research lab from it. This is how Tufalabs was funded about a year ago. We started working on ARC ( https://arcprize.org/arc-agi ), and since o3 we focus on LLM-based reasoning, self-improving loops and scaling trends. You can see some of our research there: https://tufalabs.ai/blog/_site/ We do not have too many spots left, but I want to make sure we don't miss-out on people who would be great fits. We look for obsessive people who share the same research interests.\nTo apply, email me at not_a_cat at fastmail com. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

It reuses the enclosure, encoder ring, display, and mounts of the Nest but replaces the \"thinking\" part with an open-source PCB that can interact with Home Assistant. - The encoder ring which works like an LED mouse, but in reverse: Fully reverse-engineered and on its own demo PCB - The faceplate PCB, which does the actual control of the thermostat wires, has been laid out, but the first version missed a really-obvious problem involving the behavior on power-on with certain of the GPIO pins from the ESP32, so I've got rev 3 on order from the PCB manufacturer. Nest Thermostats of the 1st and 2nd generation will no longer be supported by Google starting October 25, 2025. You will still be able to access temperature, mode, schedules, and settings directly on the thermostat – and existing schedules should continue to work uninterrupted. However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist. It has been pretty-badly supported in Home Assistant for over a year anyway, missing important connected features. reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

          "text": "To be clear, your work is next level awesome and technically more sophisticated than anything I've done. Mine is Javascript based and essentially a sprite screen graph rendering engine mixed with pixel-level effects on top of canvas, with an isometric endless world platform for runners and RPGs built on top of that renderer. I did ship one game with it, back in 2016. Since then, I've relegated my commercial work in that vein to threejs and pixijs. It sounds counterintuitive, but using your own codebase like this to develop a finished commercial product inevitably forces you to pollute the purity of the code. You start to develop sets of features that are specific to the game's needs and which force compromises that shear it away from being a general-purpose green field engine. Do I still dream of the day when I finish a new game built on my own codebase....? Totally. But maintaining a game in production and not having its needs override the intent of keeping a general purpose engone is like 4x times the work. reply",

After reverse engineering the mobile app and writing code to emulate nearly every aspect of its behavior, plus writing a codegen framework that will auto-update my code from analyzing the behavior from an Android emulator, I can pretty easily replay common user flows from any IP around the world, collecting and extracting the data. Some use cases: * OSINT (r00m101 just beat me to it by launching...) * Research into recommendation algorithms, advertising placement algorithms, etc * Marketing (ad libraries, detailed analysis of content given data not even exposed to the mobile app due to some interesting side channels, things like trend analysis, etc) * Market research for products * Sales teams can use it to find exact mentions of other products. Eg: selling crash reporting software? Look up your target accounts' brands and find examples of complaints. Plus a few more with more imagination. So I'm working on a site that allows user access to some of the read-only functions available here. Coming soon :tm:. Been really fun building it all in Rust, though :) If you're interested in anything here, email in profile. [0]: https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib reply",

Most of my work has been on the network side of the app, and not much modification; just introspection and inspecting behavior. My main question: why, do you like the UI? I honestly really hate the reddit app, I haven't seriously used it for browsing since I fixed up Libreddit into Redlib :) reply",

I started with splines for the connections and decided straight lines and junctions would be better for complex diagrams. I realized that a better way to internally define the connecting wires is via a set of lines and their connectivity (vs their endpoint coordinates). Imagine each line segment is defined by a direction (vertical or horizontal) and a position (perpendicular distance from the origin) Like ax+by=d where a and b are either 0 or 1. You also need to define which other lines it connects to. Given the list of connections you can then calculate the intersections at rendering time. By sorting the list of connections you can render the line without features at the start and end, and then draw junctions for any intermediate connections. The beauty of this would be to allow dragging blocks around and having the lines follow with the junctions passing through each other as needed. There is some housekeeping with this data structure (merging colinear segments that connect, breaking segments when needed) but the UI for dragging should be much better than anything out there. reply",

If you absolutely have to do this then do it terms of measures. Most people in software are entirely incapable of measuring anything and LLMs cannot fix their personality deficiency. 3. Ask all questions where the expected answer is a not some factoid nonsense but a decision they must make. Evaluate their answer on the grounds of risk, coverage, delivery, and performance. For example if you are interviewing a AI/ML guy ask them about how they overcome bias in the algorithms and how they weigh the consequences of different design outcomes. If they are a QA ask them about how they will take ownership of quality analysis for work already in production or how they will coach developers when communicating steps to reproduce a defect. 4. As an interviewer you should know, by now, how to listen to people. That is so much more than just audible parsing of words. If their words say one thing, but their body language says something different then they are full of shit. Its okay that they aren't experts in everything. Their honesty and humility is far more important. They can get every question wrong, but if their honesty is on and they can make solid decisions then they are at least in the top half of consideration.\n5. Finally, after evaluating their decision making ability and risk analysis then ask them for a story where they have encountered such a problem in the past and had to learn from failure.

If you ask me to write code in Notepad, I won’t be as effective as I could be if i were using Jetbrains IDEs. If I need to do some calculations, I’ll rely on a calculator rather than doing maths in my head. I’ll use grammarly (well, not anymore) to polish my non-native english writing… LLMs are just tools man. If any, you want to hire people who are good with tools, rather than “geniuses” reply",

I do a lot of programming, usually in Python and C++, and with a mathematical or algorithmic focus. For example, as part of my research I developed a BDD library that uses complexity theory to guarantee correctness with small overhead. Or recently, in my spare time, I created an AI for MTG (drafting, to be precise), using a transformer architecture with PyTorch. I am very enthusiastic about using or coming up with theoretical ideas that can improve outcomes in practice. I rely on having strong fundamentals, from mathematics over algorithms to knowledge of the actual hardware, to enable me to easily pick up new areas and tackle novel problems. Most of my research is the result of collaborations — it is important to me to both support my colleagues and be able to learn from them. Please feel free to refer to my CV for more detailed information, or my website ( https://nicze.de/philipp/ ).

For ~7 years, I was co-founder and CTO of an ed-tech company called amy.app. My co-founder and I scaled the company to about 25 employees. Before that, I earned a PhD in Human-Robot Interaction in NZ and Oxford. I've used the past year contracting, after winding down my company, to learn and apply as much as possible about AI solutions. I'm talking; LLM based email automation, AI call agent, RAG, Agentic-Search. Currently, I'm designing and working on an agentic enterprise search engine for the AEC industry. I'm very product/customer-focused and pragmatic. I like to move super fast (not only because of Cursor :D). My dream environment is an early-stage, fully remote startup.

I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs.

I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding.

          "text": "Maybe controversial, but if you already know how to program then doing a small project with a LLM is the fastest and most efficient way. Ask it to implement something, then go read the documentation to understand what is going on. After you got the hang of it, try to implement something yourself and ask the LLM to rewrite it in an idiomatic way. This worked for me after several failed attempts at learning Clojure in the pre-LLM era, when I had to spend ten minutes googling for things for every minute of actual coding. It's a fantastic way to quickly get a hold of the most common library functions and patterns. And for those who say that LLMs aren't perfect or can't be trusted: who cares. At this stage just focus on being able to stand on your own, only then work on perfecting the craft. reply",

I currently have (and like) that and the O'Reilly book \"Programming Rust\", and found them sufficient for initial exploration. I'm now trying to internalise the contents of \"Effective Rust\" (also O'Reilly) and \"Rust for Rustaceans\" from Free Starch Press - the latter of which I would say is the most advanced of these. There's still plenty I don't understand, but that's more about the minimal amount of time I've spent dabbling rather than any deficiency in these resources (so far as a dabbler can tell). reply",

I already mentioned it in their channel (they're a really welcoming community!) and I'm working on an alternative drop-in replacement backend (written in Go) [1] that will hopefully bring all the needed improvements.

Moving really fast with a lot of contributors, but stuff occasionally breaks, the setup is fiddly, but the Ai features are 100x more powerful. I just don't like the ui as much as photoprism.

          "text": "I've used PhotoPrism and Immich. Everyone's definition is different I have about 100k photos and videos which are a bit over 1 TiB (original data, not thumbnails and previews). Nether had any performance issues with a few minor exceptions on Immich (I don't recall anything from PhotoPrism but it has been a while now since I switched) 1. The Immich app's performance is awful. It is a well known problem and their current focus. I have pretty high confidence that it will be fixed within a few months. Web app is totally fine though. 2. Some background operations such as AI indexing, face detection and video conversion don't work gracefully when restarted from scratch. They all basically first delete all the old data, then start processing assets. So for many days (depending on your parallelism settings and server performance) you may be completely missing some assets from search or converted videos. But you only need to do this very rarely (change encoding settings and want to apply to the back catalog or switch AI search model). I don't upload at a particularly high rate but my sever can very easy handle the steady state. 1 is pretty major but being worked on and you can work around it by just opening the website. 2 is less important but I don't think there is any work on it. reply",

          "text": "I've been running Nextcloud in Docker with the Recognize and Memories apps for about a year and half now. It's in an off-lease refurbished Dell Precision tower from 2018. I'm using docker compose to include some supporting containers like go-vod (for hardware transcoding), another nextcloud instance to handle push notifications to the clients, and redis (for caching).  I can share some more details, foibles and pitfalls if you'd like. I initiated a rescan last week, which stacks background jobs in a queue that gets called by cron 2 or 3 times a day. Recognize has been cranking through 10k-20k photos per day, with good results. I've installed a desktop client on my dad's laptop so he can dump all of the family hard drives we've accumulated over the years. The client does a good job of clearing up disk space after uploading, which is a huge advantage in my setup. My dad has used the OneDrive client before, so he was able to pick up this process very quickly. Nextcloud also has a decent mobile client that can auto-upload photos and videos, which I recently used to help my mother-in-law upload media from her 7-year-old iPhone. reply",

          "text": "Memories and Recognize work fine with the base Nextcloud docker image. My host has a GPU so I use go-vod to leverage hardware transcoding. The base NC docker image can't access Nvidia cards (probably other GPUs as well). I could script in a way to do this but would need to run it after each update. Recognize runs fine on my CPU so I haven't explored this yet. I have an OpenMediaVault VM with a 10tb volume in the network that runs the S3 plugin (Minio-based) which is connected through Nextcloud's external storage feature (I want to migrate to Garage soon). I believe notify_push helps desktop clients cut down on the chatter when querying the external storage folder. Limiting the users that can access this also helps. I was having issues getting the notify_push app [1] to work in the container with my reverse-proxy.

The images/pictures side of things has seen quite a lot of development and with some addons you get image classification with fairly minimal effort. The system as a whole will quite happily handle many 100,000 files with pretty rubbish hardware, if you are happy to wait for batch jobs to run or you throw more hardware at it and speed up the job schedules. NC has a stock phone app which works very well these days, including camera folder uploads.  There are several more apps that integrate with the main one to add optional functionality.  For example notes and voip. It is a very large and mature setup with loads of documentation and hence extensible by a determined hacker if something is missing. reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have seen a few teams in this type of situation. It sucks to be in the middle of it, but it's actually quite normal. 1) Your VC is not the main issue VC can cause a lot of harm. They often give bad advice and it's your job to decide when to ignore their advice. But if you're counting on your VC to drive your business, then I think you've gone into the relationship with the wrong assumptions. VCs provide capital. They sell cash for a stake in your company. Once they sign the cheque they've delivered 80%-90% of their value. They don't really have any significant insights into problems, simply because they're not really exposed to customers. VCs hear a lot of hypotheses from startups, but most of them are wrong/bullshit and difficult to interpret in context of what you're building. A VC's network may be useful if you already have something that works, have a sales/marketing strategy, and need warmer intros to potential customers/partners. But VCs are not there to discover problems for you ... So I think it's important for you to readjust your expectations from VCs and investors in general. If they were good operators they'd be building their own companies ... 2) You are lost I think it's good to have a candid conversation with your co-founder on not understanding any problems well enough to build a company. In this scenario, it's important to go into discovery mode, if you still want to build a company, and use your engineering skillsets to work on temporary measures for cashflow (like consulting, dev contracts, etc). You'll also need to manage your personal expenses to survival levels. Given your prior experiences at large tech companies, and the compensation associated with them, it'll be really hard to do mentally but not insurmountable. 3) Startups may not be your thing I generally encourage people to try starting their own companies, but it's not for everyone. You really have to enjoy the \"multi-hattedness\" of being a founder and the early-stage experience. If you're not enjoying the company-building process, and would rather just build products, then you're likely better off going back to working at a more stable startup/company. You likely learned a lot of skills in trying to build a new company, and other startups will look favourably on that. So I think you have to re-evaluate whether you'd want to keep going. The problems you're dealing with only gets worse as the startup grows. Pivoting at your current stage is the easiest it'll ever get. But the main question is whether you want to be in the game, so to speak, to begin with. reply",

          "text": "This is a broad but really important question, and I feel for your situation. I've interviewed and spoken with quite a few early-stage founders this year, and many of them share similar struggles — the first year or two of a startup can be brutal, especially without a solid network or domain expertise. From what you’ve written, I wonder if you’re approaching the problem from the wrong direction. Rather than asking \"How can I make money without a network or VC backing?\" maybe the more useful question is: - Who exactly are my users?\n- What painful, urgent problems do they have? If that’s unclear, it doesn’t matter how technically great your product is or whether it’s built with AI or rocket science — it likely won’t stick. Most users don’t care how fancy your tech is; they care if it makes their life easier, saves them time, or HELP THEM MAKE MONEY. If you can't pinpoint that user pain and address it clearly, even pivoting to another domain might lead to the same frustration. One founder I spoke with recently built a job search platform. The space is totally dominated by big names like LinkedIn and Indeed, but their insight was super niche: they focused on foreign job seekers who needed H1B sponsorship. That tight focus helped them grow fast, even without VC money or big marketing budgets. It wasn’t a flashy idea — just solving a specific, urgent pain for a specific group. Marketing is another area that often gets overlooked by technical founders. Maybe try strategies like: content marketing, Product Hunt launches, engaging with communities, even open-sourcing parts of your stack because it helps with visibility and credibility. Open source can definitely help attract users — but it still needs a strong value prop and ideally some paid tier or enterprise offering to make it sustainable. One more insight: some of the best early adopters for AI tools right now are… other AI teams. They understand the value and are quicker to pay for solid infrastructure or automation tools. If you’re thinking of building “software for software,” maybe that’s a niche to explore more intentionally. You're obviously capable builders. If you're going to give it one more shot, I'd say zoom in hard on the problem and the user. Get out of “build mode” and into “discovery mode” for a bit. Try talking to 10, 20, 50 people in a space where you think you can help. It might open up clearer paths than trying to guess from the outside. Hope this helps, and best of luck — respect for sticking it out this long. reply",

If that's your target, then you might possibly be operating under at least a few wrong assumptions. As they say, you always want to sell to stakeholders. In large orgs, most people you can talk to just earn a salary. If you're selling time, money, or savings for the org , they're rarely interested. What usually holds their attention are magicians that offer to make their problems disappear . You're trying to sell a DIY kit to companies where, past a certain size, the type of competency required becomes a rare commodity in-house (regardless of how ridiculously simple the solution). So they typically avoid upgrading themselves into new problems. Integrating a SaaS is always a new problem. In addition to selling the tools to solve their problems, can you also offer to sell the service that makes them go away? Can you be the magician that makes entire problems disappear? What if you told them you'll take them away for a fee, could that get their attention? Try it and see if it at least gets the conversation going. If it does, you can lay out a price table where you charge a premium to hire a few people to work on it with your own tools. reply",

You can generally blast an ad on Reddit, Instagram, and some other sites, and people will see it. Not so with B2B. Many of your customers will be busy working, and they will not pay any attention to work-related ads outside of work. Content marketing also became more difficult.

You can monitor socials for individuals complaining about the pain point or about a competitor and reach out when you got a proper \"signal\". I also avoid saying things like \"free trial\". Instead, I offer to give them access to the paid product to try it out. It sounds less car salesman-y and as a receiver it feels nicer to get access to a paid product rather than a free trial everyone can have. Semantics most of the time, but it helps. You can write organic content about how to solve those pains (and hope people searching for solutions find it). When you do get customers you should always include a form that asks _why_ they are unsubscribing. I have learned a lot from it and it also offers a chance to turn customers back around. If someone complains about the price, I can give them a discounted rate. If someone complains about a specific quality issue I can give them free credits to make up for used ones, etc. Always respond quickly. I have landed many customers simply because I respond quickly to emails. I've had customers tell me they chose my service over \"big competitor Y\" because I respond to their emails (even though my service is more expensive). If you have an entire vertical, don't undervalue the small fish. I target ~3 different types of customers and the bulk of my revenue comes from one specific type of customer. I almost got rid of the other two customers, but realized my largest customer ($1XX,XXX/year) started off as a small fish for a year before becoming a big fish. That may go against some of the traditional advice, as the small fish tend to account for most of the support... but in my case it works out. A lot of the small customers end up being a channel on their own. A person leaves company A and goes to company B. They introduce your product at company B because they used it at company A. When I speak with people I always ask how they found out about my product. Nine times out of ten it's a \"coworker used your product at a different company\". reply",

Another thing I realized: the intended user and the actual user can be very different. In my case, I built an app called foundersmail.xyz, which gives users access to founders' official emails and other details. I got the idea after seeing someone else build a similar tool for investors — it worked well for him, but he already had an audience and reputation. For me, I promoted it across various subreddits and platforms and got around 100 users. I noticed that only 20–30% actually used up their free credits. While debugging this, I discovered most of my users were students cold-emailing founders for summer internships. I thought at least one of them might convert — but unfortunately, none did (still trying to figure that part out). My two biggest mistakes: No traffic — not enough eyeballs. Target audience mismatch — students using it instead of founders or professionals. Interestingly, there are competitors making money with similar products, so I know there’s potential. I’m still figuring out what’s missing in my approach. That said, I’m okay with the outcome so far. I haven’t spent a single rupee — free domain, free hosting, and I built it in my spare time and vibe coded. It was an experiment rather than an actual business. reply",

          "text": "So here’s the rub. Your product is almost irrelevant, as long as it is at least mediocre at what it does. What matters is your marketing and your positioning. From how you describe it, it sounds like you’re selling steak, not the sizzle - you say what it is capable of but not what it does for you. You mention that it could save “ten hours for real”, and this is the point you need to drive home - this will save you money, make you money, make you more attractive to investors, give you time and peace of mind . As to channels - social media rules the roost. Pay YouTube and TikTok influencers to shill for you. If you don’t believe enough in your product to pay for marketing, why should they believe in it? Push out hype-laden press releases. Thump your chest. Drop emails to journalists in the space, with pre-written soundbites and a link to the release. Make it easy content for them to sling up on their platform. The bar is low . Pick a vertical. Work it, target it, saturate it with your product. If you can find a vertical that’s underserved, then start there. Finally, make sure your landing page speaks to the above, and hammers the point home right out of the gate. “Vidlify will help you get that Ferrari you always wanted. Here’s how:” Save jargon for the “I’m excited, tell me more”. Then, either it will fly, and you can progress to a broader market, or it won’t, and you either accept your loss and move on, or tweak and try again - but don’t get caught in the sunk costs fallacy - just because you’ve already spent X time and Y money, it doesn’t mean you have to commit more.

I understand (and in certain context appreciate) hesitancy to blatant self-promotion but this is not the time. Not seeing your website, websites of who you think your competitors are, links to your promotional efforts etc. makes it impossible to give good advice. The best you can hope for is generic, vague advice. The devil is in details. Maybe your website is bad. Maybe your product isn't as great as you think. Maybe your pitch is not good. Generically I would say most people don't do enough promotion and could improve their \"first time use\" (onboarding) experience. For example I make a note-taking application for developers and power users: https://edna.arslexis.io/ Almost all of my users came from Show HN post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40846242 So it's a sobering realization that I got lucky enough that the post was interesting and generated discussion and made people try the app. At the same time, I know I could be doing more marketing. I know I could improve onboarding, I could record videos showing how to use more advanced features etc. Chances are you could do more marketing and you could improve onboarding in your app but to give you specific, actionable advice we would have to know much more about your app, your competitors, your marketing efforts.

Social media is a false sense of validation, even if you get a hit. Direct sales is the only thing that I found that works consistently. Get in front of anyone in this organization. My guess is you're trying to do too direct so you send a spammy email telling them how great your product is. Don't do that. Don't try to sell them anything. Don't even tell them you have a product. Just get them on a zoom call and ask them what they do now and why it sucks.

I'm sure I've deleted at least one email that could have actually been something worth investigating, but who has the time for all that? And realistically, I know what my pain points are, we talk about them all the time and actively search for solutions, but budget, reluctance of decision makers, etc often gets in the way, or the solution is too expensive compared to the actual difficulties. Not that something revolutionary can't come along, but ya, its essentially all spam. I also do the same with anyone that cold emails or calls me - 99% look to be a waste of time. When we still worked in an office you'd hear the telephones ring across the office one by one, as the robocaller worked through the extensions. Many ended up turning the ringer off, because otherwise it is an onslaught that is far more disruptive than whatever pain point they might actually be able to solve.

          "text": "Are you selling top down or bottom up? That makes a world of difference. Top down means you’re trying to sell managers and above who don’t directly use the tool. Usually they care about seeing case studies, logos of other companies, testimonials from their peers, etc. They want to look good and the way you help them with that is making one of their metrics look good, or giving them more budget to work with. Safe decisions are easier for them to make because they don’t want to get fired by making a risky bet, even if the risky bet offers more for less (“nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM”). Usually the way in with them is through partnerships, relationships, and education. Start with friends who work in that industry to get you a case study and logo or you could try to make friends at a conference if you don’t have any already. Or create some educational material around the problem and sell them consulting, using your tool as a solution. Almost always this starts off as more consultative as a relationship. If it’s bottom up, you’re selling to the individual contributors who don’t get a say about paying for the tool. That means you have to start with a generous free tier and try to get as many seats filled or usage as possible. It should bring enough value to the ICs and the organization that by the time they hit their usage caps in the free tier, the ICs are begging their managers to put a credit card in or asking to set up a sales call. If you’re not getting any usage at the free tier, then it comes back to finding where the ICs hang out and trying to integrate your tool as part of a workflow to common problems they solve. This is again about educating and making/leaning on friends to help spread the word and convince others to use your tool. In both cases, relationships matter a lot to get initial traction (existing customers, friends in the industry, partners). They will help you figure out what’s needed to sell into the market you want to sell into, what’s holding you back, and getting you early validation. I didn’t see you mention existing relationships you have, so maybe that’s a good place to start. reply",

So if your competition is killing it, and you are not getting bites on your added value, you need to talk to people to find out what pains they still have even when using your competitor's solution, and then make sure your added value resolves those pains. Otherwise, you've got the same solution, just a shinier version, and that is all your 1:1 feature comparison will show. There is a big caveat on this that we have no idea what product or feature set you are talking about, so this is pure speculation. You'd have to share a lot more about your product and marketing to get more substantive answers. reply",

I was over the project that kept the lights on and survived every round of layoffs. The customer was hesitant about giving a small struggling startup money and made us put our code in escrow that they would have access to under certain conditions.  The startup failed, they got the code and the company that acquired us for scraps added an addendum to my severance agreement that released me from my non compete and allowed me to have access to  my work laptops and work for the client. A few years later I was the dev lead at another company and I found the perfect SaaS product for our needs.  But the CTO wasn’t comfortable basing our entire project around a one man startup.  I suggested an escrow agreement, the lawyers got  involved and we signed the contract and we were now 80% of his business. I’m not suggesting you so an escrow.  I am saying that many businesses aren’t going to trust a no name one person startup until you have some referenceable clients, provide an easy migration path if you go tits up and they know you aren’t a fly by night company. Personally, I’m in the camp of “no one ever got fired for buying $WellKnownIndustryStandardProduct” But I don’t have too much actionable advice when it comes to top of the funnel sales.  I’m a “post sales architect” as part of my job.  The next step below sales. reply",
