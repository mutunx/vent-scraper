Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

My focus in the past few years has been on being a force multiplier for my team and increasing predictability, stability, and developer enjoyment of output. I'm also a big proponent of mentoring and frequently create tech talks from the daily work notes I take so that the lessons from any challenges I face benefit not only me, but my team as well. My preference is functional languages and companies that use Nix and/or NixOS, but it's more important to have a healthy company and team than any specific technology.

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a entry or mid-level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

Resume: https://mbrigdan.github.io/mbrigdan/resume.pdf Email: mbrigdan@gmail.com -- Hi folks, I'm Matt. About 7 years of experience working at the interface between data science and backend development. My most recent work has been around optimization of grid-scale energy storage systems - I was the technical lead for the team's first go-live in the ERCOT power market. A lot of experience taking something functional but bespoke (think e.g. a Jupyter notebook from a DS researcher) and applying rigorous software engineering principles to make it modular/scalable/maintainable, and dealing with the problems that result from applying machine learning in the real world (e.g. robustness to forecast error). Primarily experienced in Python but I've learned a lot of languages at this point and don't mind learning new tools that fit that job. Not afraid to get my hands dirty deep in the guts of algorithms/statistics/mathematics, my background is in electrical engineering with some signal processing experience. I've got years of math skills crying out to be used! I'm looking for a role that lets me sink my teeth into challenging problems - some kind of math/statistical analysis/optimization/algorithmic bent would be ideal, I get a great kick out of testing out cutting edge new libraries, implementing an algorithm from a new research paper, that kind of thing.

Résumé/CV: https://resume.sadauskas.com/ Email: psadauskas@gmail.com There’s an inflection point in every startup, where you’ve got your MVP and first customers, and now you need to scale everything. You need to make the application faster while also adding features and fixing bugs. You need to grow the whole team, not just engineering, and build the tools to support them. This is where I’m in my groove. I’ve grown teams from 3 to 100+, improved performance while scaling to 100x the load, and designed and built features from the ground up in an iterative and agile manner to minimize time-to-delivery while maximizing flexibility for future work. I have over 20 years of experience as a full-stack web application developer, primarily as a Rails developer since its inception. I also have experience with a large variety of languages, frameworks and technologies. I’m comfortable working at entire levels of the app stack, from CSS to SQL. I have the experience to know when to hack together a quick solution, or take the time to architect a foundation that will scale and provide a platform upon which the team can build stable features for years. If you’re an early stage startup that has found product/market fit, and needs someone to scale both your product and your team, then I’d be a great choice to help you out. reply",

Also the ranking went up during that period! * Using LLM rewrites to generate better product pages driving higher conversion and higher traffic * Created a full-stack web app showcasing our bespoke offerings, which halves the time to close the deal (before this, obtaining a price took a while) * Used triple exponential smoothing to predict supply and demand, showcasing the gap for our company to drive more supply to * Created my own project management dashboard so that certain weak PM skills I have are actually quite okay now :) reply",

All I want for christmas is some gnarly problems to chew on, otherwise it's coal for Christmas. I'm a data scientist with 20+ years experience who enjoys gnarly, avant-garde problems. I saved a well known German automaker from lemon law recalls. I've worked with a major cloud vendor to predict when servers would fail, allowing them to load shed in time. Some of the things I've done: - Live chip counting for estmating betting in casinos.\n    - Automotive part failure prediction (Lemon law recalls)\n    - Server fleet failure prediction allowing load shedding.\n    - Shipping piracy risk prediction - routing ships away from danger. \n    - Oil reservoir & well engineering forecasting production.\n    - Realtime routing (CVRP-PD-TW, shifts) for on demand delivery. \n    - Legal entity and contract term extraction from documents. \n    - Wound identification & tissue classification.\n    - The usual LLM and agent stuff. (I'd love to work on effective executive functioning)\n    - Your nasty problem here. I use the normal stacks you'd expect. Python, Pytorch, Spark/ray, Jupyter/Merimo, AWS, Postgres, Mathematica and whatever else is needed to get the job done. Ultimately it's about the problem, not the tools. I have years of experience helping companies plan, prototype, and productionize sane data science solutions.\nGet in touch if you have a problem, my email is in my profile. reply",

But the majority has been with laravel. Most front end experience is with vuejs and angular. About me:\nI have roughly 10 years of experience as a full stack developer. Outside of this i have 3 years of experience teaching at coding boot camps and adjuncting at a local college. I absolutely love build tools and sites that people enjoy using. I always joke that I design functional potatoes. But that doesn't mean I can't make something pretty. Lol At my current place of employment I have taken the place of the go to guy for llms and agents. I frequently spend time learning how they work and going over research papers. Currently I'm working on automating video creation for advertisers. Some key accomplishments over that last two years are: complete overhaul and redesign of a front end, automated 25% of all requests for a specific workflow (final output is on par with human output), fully automated process that required user approval before being sent out.

I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator. I was previously the first analytics hire at a Computer Vision startup, Roboflow. Before that, I was co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things. I'm primarily looking for data leadership or technical product roles. I enjoy ideating solutions, building MVPs, experimentation, and orchestrating all of the work to achieve a strategic vision. I prefer a 70/30 split between leader/IC. I prefer smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up. Despite my background, I'd like to avoid working in the advertising space. reply",

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. Further, I'm also interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

      "title": "Ask HN: Quality of recent gens of Dell/Lenovo laptops worse than 10 years ago?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I got a Dell XPS for work a couple years ago on someone's recommendation... one of my worst-ever decisions. The touchpad sucks and routinely breaks requiring restarts, constantly having driver issues (and you have to deal with the capital-N Nightmare that is SupportAssist for drivers), graphics card is busted and makes the display driver crash once a month. Power states are completely broken. Laptop will randomly turn on when it's in my bag and rev up to ten thousand degrees. Laptop will randomly, when on full battery and closed, decide to hard-shutoff leading to a windows recovery boot. Decides to do BIOS updates when it's at 3% battery in the middle of the night, then when I wake up for work the next morning it has to go through a ten-minute recovery sequence. Battery is swelling after only a couple years of use, which sometimes causes keys on the keyboard to stop working. In the middle of a slack convo I've had to type \"Sorrymyspacebarstoppedworkinggottarestartmycomputer\". BSODs, hard drive corruption, you name it. Never buy Dell. Not that there's many good options out there unless you're willing to drop two week's pay on a Framework - but anything is better than Dell. EDIT: Another I thought of - sound card is busted and sounds like it has a low pass filter on it. I know it's not a speaker issue because on occasion it magically fixes itself until the next restart. reply",

I have stopped using Apple laptops more than 15 years ago and since then I have used only Linux laptops. I have no idea whether hibernate worked on my laptops, because this is a feature for which I have never felt any need. I always take care to optimize the boot time on my computers with custom built kernels and carefully selected daemons (and I do not use systemd). For decades, the boot time on my laptops had been of perhaps twenty seconds at most and the biggest delay in starting to use the computers after being powered off is entering a password to unlock them, not the start-up of the OS. Using something like hibernation instead of complete power off would speed up negligibly the process of beginning to work on the computer. reply",

Rebooted and everything seemed to be working smoothly again but it was... concerning so I left it running overnight. Came back to YET ANOTHER BSOD the next morning and was like F### this.

The bottom cover doesn't have access panels anymore, but it's got just a few captive(!!) screws and the whole bottom comes off. Everything is neatly exposed and you don't need to access the top of the board at all. The bottom cover has plastic clips along with the screws, but they're spring loaded! They aren't simply molded in and cannot snap off. It's some incredible attention to detail. I've noticed that most recent laptops have the vent behind the screen hinge where it's completely blocked if the screen is closed. Thinkpad has the vent fully exposed. In fact, it exposes more vent when the screen is closed. Too bad the CPU is a lemon. One of the new AMD chips with a built in NPU. The NPU is slower than the integrated graphics for inference. Not a discrete card, just the GPU baked into the chip. In contrast, I got a hand-me-down Dell XPS-something from 2020 when I first started this job. It idles IDLES! at 100°C. I tried to re-paste the CPU, but the heat pipes were so small and thin that I crushed one between my fingers. Even with massive airflow through the case from external fans, it never drops below 100C. Absolutely inexcusable. Looks to me like Lenovo still has it. At least if you're paying real money for a professional level machine. This new Thinkpad is now my #1 most repairable and maintainable machine. T530 is a close second. Absolutely every other laptop I've ever used is tied for last place in the garbage. reply",

The laptop itself has a frame of metal and a shell of plastic. It's definitely not light, one of those laptops in the 3 kg category (6 lbs?) and definitely not cheap. It's also built for total repairability: it opens with no screws and I can replace everything even the CPU and the GPU l. I replaced the HDD and the DVD with 2 SSDs, maxed out the RAM to 32 GB and replaced the keyboard many times, when keys eventually wear and start to fail. I'd buy it again, with modern components (NVME bus, DDR5 RAM) and without the number pad so I can center the space bar and the touchpad. reply",

They are not perfect, but the different models (from cheapo plastic-case 12/13 inch to top-of-the-line metal cased \"16 inch desktop replacements\" lappies and low to mid-level desktops) have been better built, and more easily serviced, than comparable Lenovo, Dell & Acer models I've had my hands on in the same time. Our new MSP pushed Lenovos on us for a batch of 25 or so computers including my latest laptop, and I regret it. They just didn't have a 15\" metal case in the price range so I got a plastic 16\". Overall performance is lower than comparably spec'd HP Z-Book Fireflys I was using, when this Thinkpad T16 G4 hits the upper limits of RAM, it feels like it's using swap on a slow platter drive. Even on lower-spec HP Pro & EliteBooks, they slow down at max RAM but don't just freeze. Our staff thrashes the shit out of gear, so finding decently-priced lower-spec metal-bodied laptops is essential. Even on latest HP laptops I am able to replace RAM, batteries, SSDs without dealing with epoxied sockets. Haven't had to often, but displays and keyboards could be swapped if absolutely needed last time we had to several years ago. That said, the performance of onboard HP Bluetooth sucks compared to others I've used and their stock bloatware is terrible. Specific to Lenovo, when I was shopping for a bunch of laptops about 3 years ago there were weird gotchas like \"I can get every spec I need EXCEPT backlit keyboard, which kicks me up to the next model, at least $300 more/unit\" and \"Gee, they solder in a low amount of RAM on this one to make you...yup, spend at least $300 more/unit\"... reply",

I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I started buying 4x4 mini PCs.  They're exactly what you describe.  For $600 I got an 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 8745H with 96GB of RAM from Minisforum.  The graphics aren't half bad and the overall system has been really good.  It's even got better thermal performance than the Intel 4x4 I had previously and generally runs 10C cooler for the same workloads. If you don't absolutely need a \"backpack portable\" computer I can only highly recommend them. reply",

          "text": "I would say yes. Having been a big fan of Dell and having used it's laptops for both professional and personal uses over many years, I have moved off it to Acer. Couple of reasons - the first is that there is a price premium which I cannot seem to justify and second is the teething / niggling issues which I have had to face in pretty much every Dell I have owned. Sometime, it will be too long a time to wake up from sleep or a random crash which requires me to fetch bitlocker key from my account so that I can boot it up again to driver update issues to the fan continuously running for no reason etc. I had, by chance, a good experience with Acer in the past and since then have purchased a couple fo them more and the experience has been seamless and pleasant. I do hope Dell ups its game as it was an iconic and innovative brand but there is less now to differentiate it from competition and so no reason for the premium to be charged. reply",

          "text": "Sounds like Dells chargers are garbage. Yet another reason to stay away from Dell in that case. Never had this issue with any charger in my life. Everything USB should still take normal 5 volts, which any charger should provide without needing negotiation, and anything larger that actually needs more juice also should have the appropriate electronics to handle that (i.e. it's a phone or a laptop or a tablet or similarly expensive device). If you have devices that don't fall into either of those categories, so they don't take normal 5 volts, or they need more juice but are picky about USB, I'd consider them faulty from the get-go, as it's clear they haven't actually implemented USB-PD in any meaningful way. And if your charger doesn't provide 5 volts without asking, it too is faulty. It's hard to go wrong with charging cables when it comes to USB-C. I agree there's a mess on the data side, but the USB Forum can't even get its head straight with what it should even be called, so it's no wonder nobody there has the balls to mandate colour coding or something similarly helpful. reply",

I only had to change it as I felt I needed a better screen and performance. The Intel processor was showing its age. I have only minor complaints running Thinkpad with Ubuntu.

I bought a newer one in 2022 and sold it again a couple of months later because, although it had a faster processor and more RAM, it felt flimsier. I'm also currently upgrading a refurbed Lenovo X270 for my granddaughter who's starting high school, and I am thoroughly impressed. Newer Lenovos are slimmer and slicker, but this thing will still be trucking after the cockroach apocalypse. reply",

          "text": "I got my first Dell laptop, the XPS15, 5 years ago.  Prior to that I had a good 25 years as a Thinkpad die-hard.  The XPS has been ... ok.  I've had some issues with it resetting for no apparent reason over its life.  Frequency varies, but sometimes it'll just blank the screens and then the BIOS comes up on the display, a few times a week, then it'll be good for a month or more. I had one issue where I needed to ship it back: it would reset and then it was running off the battery, and no matter what port I plugged a charger/docking station into it wouldn't charge until I powered it off and back on again.  I got them to do a replacement under warranty a couple years ago. Around a month ago it was doing the reset fairly frequently and then wouldn't power on sometimes, and I noticed the wrist rest was a little bowed.  I replaced the battery pack (kind  of a pain, but not the worst I've done), and it was good for around a month, but now it has that \"won't charge the battery\" issue again.  I believe when they did the previous repair they replaced the motherboard, but now I'm out of warranty. For my next laptop I kind of want a Framework, so I can replace the mobo if I need to.  My work likes us to replace hardware no more frequently than every 5-6 years, but we get a warranty for way less than that (my laptop I pushed to get a 4 year). Meanwhile my previous Thinkpad T470s is still going strong, though the screen just developed a line through it.  That's ~10 year old now. My personal 4 year old Macbook has been a real workhorse, never had any hardware issues with it.  My son's macbook has been another story, he's had that in for service 4-5 times in the 3 years he's had it.  But, I suspect that is more him than the hardware.  I don't baby my MBP, but he is just terrible with things.  He's lucky if a pair of glasses can last 6 months, ditto with a phone (usually broken screens), so I'm not sure I can blame the MB Air... reply",

And yeah my 470S is still pretty strong. I started to use it again for my side projects.

Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.

You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes, deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when sites change. The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you will build need to be performant and maintainable. You should have solid Python skills and experience scraping ecommerce websites and APIs. You should also like the slightly-obsessive investigative nature of the work.

Our work consists of a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts. Our principles are here: https://futo.org/about/what-is-futo/ Machine Learning Engineer - FUTO Keyboard FUTO Keyboard is a privacy-first software keyboard for Android. Every prediction inference routine runs entirely on-device; no user data can ever leave the device. We support over 150 keyboard layouts and languages, and over 700 layout + language combinations (not all of them include dictionary or predictions) Swipe typing is an important part of the mobile typing experience for many. Applying machine learning here poses a unique challenge due to the requirement of needing to support so many layouts and languages, as well as user-added personal dictionary words (or even layout customizations!), with limited data. We have previously collected and publicly released a US English QWERTY dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/ We are looking for a machine-learning researcher or engineer to work through these challenges and help us improve the swipe typing experience in FUTO Keyboard.

Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026. As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO).  Now that we have thousands of customers, I have many other responsibilities and need to bring on a fulltime engineer (you!) to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  Together, you and I will add obfuscation, improve our interpreter, possibly re-write method dispatch, etc.  You don’t need to be a compiler/runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code. If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other large open source project, are compiler/runtime curious, and want to work at a growing startup, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding. We’re a small, senior team, making something people want. Tech: GCP, Cloudflare, React, Dart, C++, Rust.

          "text": "The biggest thing to be aware of honestly is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Essentially, .NET Core has dropped the \"Core\" moniker. It's just .NET (I tend to refer to it as .NET proper when differentiating between Framework). This change began with .NET 5.0. If you're starting from scratch, you will want to build everything using .NET now. Do not use .NET Framework unless absolutely necessary. Probably the most common reason you'd be stuck using .NET Framework is because your project is reliant on some driver or library that isn't making the transition to .NET proper. If you're in this situation, you should try to move as much stuff as you can to be on .NET proper and then use .NET Standard , a middle man library Microsoft developed for this exact situation, to allow for cohesion between .NET Framework and .NET proper. Otherwise, in terms of specific \"modern\" coding practices? I'd say to pay attention to modern OOP approaches in general. Dependency Injection seems to be used everywhere now. Also, be careful using Reflection. People get a lot done with it really fast, but if it starts being used for more than just attribute inspection and you're doing some crazy shit with it, that's usually a sign of a bigger architectural issue. Lastly, review LINQ if it's been a while for you. Specifically, understand deferred execution as a lot of people shoot themselves in the foot by tacking on a `.ToList()` and enumerating over a massive collection they shouldn't be enumerating over. C# has changed a lot, but it's more subtle than the way a lot of other languages have progressed. Mostly just new features that you can survive very easily without. C# 14 is bringing some interesting changes though, but that's still pretty new, so I'd see the release notes on that if you're interested. reply",

That art/originality is fading, that technology is causing more harm than good, and that most jobs now exist to feed some mindless machine where sole goal is to get people addicted. Tech roles feel drained of purpose, and non-tech roles are being eaten away.<p>This outlook is a stark contrast to the era I grew up in. From 2010 to 2020, tech optimism was at its peak. Despite the flaws, companies like Airbnb, Uber, Amazon, and countless SaaS startups felt like they were genuinely improving things—breaking old monopolies and building better systems.<p>Now we have AI, arguably the most transformative technology of our lifetime, yet a lot of times the reaction seems to be exhaustion rather than excitement. Sure, people love using it, but unlike the early Internet, AI doesn't seem like a medium for creativity. The core value feels just about compressing the time it takes to do what we were already doing.<p>Maybe it’s age. Maybe it’s just me. And maybe I am bitten by false nostalgia. But I’m curious: how are others seeing this shift?</p></p></p></div>",

My view of technical climate change is: it's usually good for the ordinary, educated people in the first few decades, because diversity and competition make the old caste difficult to keep up so they need to adjust and wait until the whole movement slows down. And then they swallow the whole thing down. We have had a good run and now it is time for them to reap the fruits. The other thing that I'm a bit more worried is, each technological advance first IMPROVES but eventually REDUCES the rate of success of violent revolutions. And violent revolution is the antidote for human societies. reply",

          "text": "I like to read about the Industrial Revolution a lot, and I think a thing that’s lost in the the way we talk about luddites was the change from guild/skilled labor to factory labor.  Software engineering is a lot like that old guild labor, you understand the whole of your craft (at the time called “mysteries”) and work to build things understanding that entirety. When things changed to factory / assembly lines, sure,  products got a lot cheaper and more plentiful for everyone else, but if you were a blacksmith or stone mason or etc.  you lost both your middle class income, status in society, and day to day joy from being an expert with autonomy — we talk a lot about how engineers value autonomy when building engineering cultures. With AI that’s starting to slip away. I actually think the twentieth century is a global culture-tech inflection point, and while I’m reluctant to say things will just continue to get worse (there are a lot of years ahead of us and lots of eras and changes to go through). The one thing I’m sure of is that for all the benefits technological change brings they’re not evenly distributed. So as many I think have pointed out, if you like spending 8+ hours a day on the nuts and bolts of software engineering, and you’re really invested in the sort of late nineties to early 2020’s technological paradigm, subjectively —- things are probably getting worse from here on out. reply",

          "text": "A lot of art from the middle ages is anonymous. Painting itself is an extension of the artist, containing the intension of the person producing it and hence no name is necessary. This is a theoretical state of quality, where activity is not measured in numbers or on a scale but is seen as expression of a particular unique human being. Then comes the renaissance and painters begin to attach names to their works. Here starts a crucial shift - a turn from quality to quantity. Certain artists are better than others and hence quality itself is now measured (quantified) using a name of the person. After that the name becomes so prevalent that some works begin to be valuable only because a certain name was responsible in producing that work. Think - Picasso. Quantity starts to take over. Then comes film and comics and ads where the painter is expected to have no  individuality, and he is praised for having a style and technique that is replaceable. Same is true for corporate software development by the way. Here the name (the intermediate state connecting quality and quantity) starts to disappear and is often replaced by a name of a \"golem\" - a corporation. Quantity dominates - more and faster is better, and the more \"nameless\" the better. Ten years ago one might think that this is the limit of dehumanisation and it cannot move any further. But now we have AI - where a work of art (or other kind of work) cannot be associated with any quality (cannot be given a name) in principle. And quantity (more, faster, cheaper) dominates. When you think in these terms, the \"techno-optimism\" is just a place somewhere in this arrow moving from quality to quantity. Or in other words moving from a qualitative anonymity (my work is an extension of my being) to quantitative anonymity (the work is not associated with any being). Hence, it is not a stable position. reply",

          "text": "I see it.  I think that a couple of large things happened in the larger society, and tech is inside of that. The American Dream kind of died.  It died in two ways, and it's important to keep them separate. First, the American Dream died (or at least got very sick) in that the path from high school graduate to high-paying job got very narrow.  This was because other countries rebuilt after WWII, and outsourcing happened, and the US culture changed from more \"we're all in this together\" to more \"I got mine, you can starve\". Second, the American Dream died even for those who got the well-paid jobs.  They found out that it wasn't enough - that they needed something more than more money.  Material prosperity is not enough, and more material prosperity won't fix it.  Humans need something more, and we aren't getting it. We're not getting it from technology, either.  We don't need better graphics and instant movies.  We don't even need social media - or at least, we don't need what social media has turned into, making us a slave to dopamine hits. With that going on, how do people view tech?  As a way to get rich?  Well, that's probably not going to work out, at least not for most of us, and even if it does, all it gets me is money.  As a means of making the world better?  Yeah, how's that working out? We're feeling the lack of something, and money isn't going to fix it, and tech isn't either. I think that's what changed.  People thought that tech could make the world better, and make them rich along the way, and now they see that tech can't fix what we need fixed, and being rich isn't enough. reply",

My particular concerns are around atrophy of basic skills (reading, research, writing, etc.,) the authenticity/trustworthiness of \"knowledge\" obtained from various Internet sources (misinformation, fake news, deep fakes,) and lack of personal contact and interaction in a world where peoples' only connection to others is through a screen (fakebook, instagram, tiktok, etc..)

I didn't have to try to convince myself then. All of the ideas we thought were going to lead to something cool have been weaponized against us to maximize corporate profits. How many apps do you actually use on your phone? The theory was cool, the reality is it's a little addiction slab not really used for the 'cool' ideas. Airbnb exploited loopholes in local laws to move hospitality into neighborhoods, with detriment to them. Amazon literally has a plan for when it runs out of low paid workers because it is so bad. Yet it's plan isn't 'be a less shitty company to work for'. If you did home automation stuff, how much of that is still around, working, and useful? I have a really complex system to turn my front light on at dusk using the internet, something a light sensor did at my parents house in the 90s. And that's about all I have left working. When you stop your car at a stoplight, and instead of having buttons you have a big screen with an ad, that is also selling all of your movement info, are you experiencing progress? Netflix, Amazon, etc use to have algorithms that made what you wanted rise to the top. They now all make what Netflix/Amazon/etc want rise to the top. Every tech company's main focus is 'how shitty can I get away with if shitty gets me more money'? Instead of giving me relevant, they now either sell add positions (Amazon) or chose position based on how profitable it is to them (Netflix/Spotify financial/licensing considerations come above an algo taylored for me like they used to have). We literally have seperate recipes from American companies now. Slop for the domestic American market, and the 1990s actual food grade recipes for Europe. For our grains now, instead of traditional harvesting, we spray Roundup/glyphosate (tested and approved for earlier in the crop cycle) to kill the wheat/etc to better control harvest. We literally added as a final step for our food to pour questionable glyphosate/herbicides on it all. America now has more private equity than McDonalds, build on a business model that would have made Reagan era cocaine filled corporate raiders blush. What once made for scandals for movies is now more common than McDonalds. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/private-equity-consolidation... reply",

          "text": "I think the future is both bright and dark. It has never been this easy to create anything yourself. Anything from software to hardware, you can buy and build the tools and make something amazing in your spare time that would only 20 years ago would take a small team with some funding. There are 2 kinds of companies:\n1. The greedy kind that always want more. They see extracting money out of their customers as their sole purpose.\n2. The kind that want to build good stuff and help people. A lot of companies start out as nr 2, but with time and growth, greedy people have a tendency to climb the ladder and turn the nr 2 companies into nr 1 unless the original team knows about this and resist such change. This also means that the founders must be okay living their whole life without owning a Bugatti. VC companies make it hard to stay as nr 2, because even if you are good, if you make a deal with a VC firm that wants to 100x their investment through you, then you have already let the greedy devil through the front door. A nr 1 company will over time turn into a parasite. Once they extract more value than they give, it is a downward spiral of destruction on the way down. A big part of the US tech economy (as seen from Europe) have \"evolved\" into parasites. They say they fuel the economy. What they actually mean is that they cause a lot of money to flow around. A parasite that suck a lot of blood will also make a lot of blood flow, so it is not a good measurement of health. The good news are that parasites die eventually. A lot of people (especially outside US) are very much aware about how toxic american companies have become. In Europe there is right now a whole sector growing rapidly that is doing \"X but European\" and it looks very promising. This is not only a Europe thing, the same is happening in Asia, but European laws and culture have accelerated it. What this means is that you will see a lot of destruction and downfall as these giant parasites have to die or kill their hosts. Don't be the host. Don't rely on them. Don't do business with them. Don't work for them. Avoid them like the plague, and don't stand in their way when they fall. They will cause collateral damage, regulators should have stepped in a long time ago, but greed prevented that. These companies are already leaving big billion dollar holes in the market. They can't win those markets back, because in business trust is everything and they have lost trust from these markets. As they continue falling, they need to continue sucking out more blood of their remaining hosts which will further erode trust and create new bigger markets looking for a non toxic alternative. Be that alternative. It has never been easier. The future is bright if you want to. Random info: \"money is the root of all evil\" is false. It is actually \"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\". If you dig into the original bible texts, it is clear that it is not talking about money as being evil. It is talking about a spirit (mentality) that in English would be more accurately translated as \"greed\". It is very clear that greed causes destruction and suffering on all levels. From companies managing to erode the middle class to Putin wanting more land. There are companies that steal (legal with greedy corrupt leaders) water only to sell it back to the local population. Why? Greed. It caused Boeing planes to fall from the sky, it caused the 2008 crash and it will cause the AI crash. No matter how much they eat, they remain hungry without limits. This is what greed does. Greed weaponizes good companies with good ideas and turn it into a money sucking machine with no limits. If you want to resist this, you have to start with yourself. Everything starts with one person. Be that person. reply",

          "text": "Yes. It wasn't an unintended consequence. The goal of the legislation was to \"stop children from accessing age inappropriate content\" on the internet. Ahead of the legislation it was known that there would be a significant proportion of individuals who would switch to using VPN's because without platform based verification it would be a pita for users (more logins, random age verification services, and some sites just deciding to block). However, VPN's, come with their own minimum age 18 T&C's, as do the means of payment for those services (credit and debit). So from the pov of \"stop children from accessing age inappropriate content\" similar result Not perfect, but empirically this seems to be working well enough e.g. \"New data shows no rise in children’s VPN use after the introduction of online age checks\" ( https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/research/data-shows-no-r... ), i.e. the VPN traffic is largely adults. As to other unintended consequences, such as making it more difficult for the authorities to snoop on their citizens, I doubt this effectively makes any difference whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Setting this up through your router / network infra is one possible path. Another AU citizen here. I've been beefing up our home in prep for these laws too. You can use policy based routing to send traffic through a few VPN egress points depending on either domain, or IP based country lookup. Most providers will let you keep simultaneous connections up. This then applies to all devices so streaming apps works well (e.g. for my partner to access her home country's public broadcaster) and any complexity remains hidden from others you live with. From there, a wireguard tunnel for personal devices back through home means you can keep these same paths active when mobile. I'm looking forward to the level of networking and systems knowledge these laws will encourage across future generations. reply",

I recommend reading about authoritarian regimes in Europe (it was not just Germany) and how they controlled discourse, and what people had accessed to.

Them being able to serve up step-sister roleplay slop in two clicks isn't something I care about protecting. I doubt they said that comment about Pornhub specifically, maybe, but I can believe driving certain sites out of business being part of the intention, barely moderated suicide discussion forums filled with teenagers for one. I will read about that, but I quite quickly realised talking about this in person it's one of the few things I feel this strongly about, and even I'm not sure why I agree so entirely.

There’s a four month waiting list for licensing due to backlogs at the local County Court. The alternative is therefore to use up a strike and apply to have the account repurposed back to a Citizen User Account.  CUAs must remain below a 50:1 down/up ratio and must have p90 non-https “control” traffic of 48kbps or less.  They are expensive too but you get a 25% discount if you install your ISP’s mobileconfig / MDM profile though.  With the profile discount the price is now only £64.99 a month. (This assumes you run an Approved Platform capable of mobile device management.  Anything else — Linux based, old versions of macOS, Windows <= 13 etc. — has to pay the full price and CUAs are limited to one Custom Access device per connection.) You can get it down to £49.99 a month if you sign up for a 12-month trial of their home security system — cameras, door “e-locks”, that sort of thing.  The devices are locked down but you can see the last 48h of events on their cloud portal.  The devices have tamper detectors and the traffic is encrypted e2e but luckily that doesn’t count towards your CUA agreement’s limits on opaque traffic. reply",

Not only are the UK and EU exerting pressure against US companies to change their global policies, but especially in the case of the UK, they are attempting to change the legal framework governing the internet by claiming that sites are somehow subject to UK law unless they proactively block the UK. All this on top of long time EU/UK participation in shady “counter-misinformation” efforts that have spun up a web of state-funded NGOs who attempt to influence US policy against freedom of information.

The idea of a global internet is becoming increasingly infeasible and I believe that China is just ahead of its time. If you look at the UK, it is really just a matter of time until they figure out that the real issue they are having is that, the Internet allows communication with entities they can not enforce their laws on.

The Investigatory Powers Act governs how and when data can be requested by law enforcement and other relevant agencies. It includes robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy, ensuring that data is accessed only in exceptional cases and only when necessary and proportionate. The suggestion that cybersecurity and access to data by law enforcement are at odds is false.

          "text": "Currently, making a site accessible is more like a strong linter and a few standard UX elements (skip to content, etc.) Typically your tasks are things like: Increase the contrast on these 11 fonts, add missing labels, ensure keyboard navigation works. It is more of a checklist-type set of actions than a framework or library. But it was supposed to be evolving, at least from a regulatory perspective. The Office of Civil Rights in the DOJ owns enforcement of this, and that team is pretty friendly and reasonable. Or was a few years ago... I haven't talked to them since the current administration came in, so don't what what their current state is. In any case, their plan a couple years ago was to stop making it about checklists and accessibility checkers and work towards a broader goal of \"Make the UX as good for people with limits as it is for people without limits.\" They wanted to get away from, for example, solutions that would meet the letter of the law by making a non-mouse user hit tab 117 times when a mouse user only had to do one click. So if you are really trying to do accessibility well, that is the perspective to embrace - not \"give me a tool that fulfills a checklist\", but \"Make UX equitable for all.\" reply",

We did enough to cover our bases, maybe 80-90% of the way there, but that’s it. I mean emotionally I get it. But it’s a business at the end of the day.

Phrasing like this just confirms to me there’s no nuance.<p>Are these the current ethics in Y Combinator?</p></p></p></div>",
