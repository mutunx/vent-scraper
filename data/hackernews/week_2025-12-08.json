Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

My focus in the past few years has been on being a force multiplier for my team and increasing predictability, stability, and developer enjoyment of output. I'm also a big proponent of mentoring and frequently create tech talks from the daily work notes I take so that the lessons from any challenges I face benefit not only me, but my team as well. My preference is functional languages and companies that use Nix and/or NixOS, but it's more important to have a healthy company and team than any specific technology.

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a entry or mid-level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

Resume: https://mbrigdan.github.io/mbrigdan/resume.pdf Email: mbrigdan@gmail.com -- Hi folks, I'm Matt. About 7 years of experience working at the interface between data science and backend development. My most recent work has been around optimization of grid-scale energy storage systems - I was the technical lead for the team's first go-live in the ERCOT power market. A lot of experience taking something functional but bespoke (think e.g. a Jupyter notebook from a DS researcher) and applying rigorous software engineering principles to make it modular/scalable/maintainable, and dealing with the problems that result from applying machine learning in the real world (e.g. robustness to forecast error). Primarily experienced in Python but I've learned a lot of languages at this point and don't mind learning new tools that fit that job. Not afraid to get my hands dirty deep in the guts of algorithms/statistics/mathematics, my background is in electrical engineering with some signal processing experience. I've got years of math skills crying out to be used! I'm looking for a role that lets me sink my teeth into challenging problems - some kind of math/statistical analysis/optimization/algorithmic bent would be ideal, I get a great kick out of testing out cutting edge new libraries, implementing an algorithm from a new research paper, that kind of thing.

Résumé/CV: https://resume.sadauskas.com/ Email: psadauskas@gmail.com There’s an inflection point in every startup, where you’ve got your MVP and first customers, and now you need to scale everything. You need to make the application faster while also adding features and fixing bugs. You need to grow the whole team, not just engineering, and build the tools to support them. This is where I’m in my groove. I’ve grown teams from 3 to 100+, improved performance while scaling to 100x the load, and designed and built features from the ground up in an iterative and agile manner to minimize time-to-delivery while maximizing flexibility for future work. I have over 20 years of experience as a full-stack web application developer, primarily as a Rails developer since its inception. I also have experience with a large variety of languages, frameworks and technologies. I’m comfortable working at entire levels of the app stack, from CSS to SQL. I have the experience to know when to hack together a quick solution, or take the time to architect a foundation that will scale and provide a platform upon which the team can build stable features for years. If you’re an early stage startup that has found product/market fit, and needs someone to scale both your product and your team, then I’d be a great choice to help you out. reply",

Also the ranking went up during that period! * Using LLM rewrites to generate better product pages driving higher conversion and higher traffic * Created a full-stack web app showcasing our bespoke offerings, which halves the time to close the deal (before this, obtaining a price took a while) * Used triple exponential smoothing to predict supply and demand, showcasing the gap for our company to drive more supply to * Created my own project management dashboard so that certain weak PM skills I have are actually quite okay now :) reply",

All I want for christmas is some gnarly problems to chew on, otherwise it's coal for Christmas. I'm a data scientist with 20+ years experience who enjoys gnarly, avant-garde problems. I saved a well known German automaker from lemon law recalls. I've worked with a major cloud vendor to predict when servers would fail, allowing them to load shed in time. Some of the things I've done: - Live chip counting for estmating betting in casinos.\n    - Automotive part failure prediction (Lemon law recalls)\n    - Server fleet failure prediction allowing load shedding.\n    - Shipping piracy risk prediction - routing ships away from danger. \n    - Oil reservoir & well engineering forecasting production.\n    - Realtime routing (CVRP-PD-TW, shifts) for on demand delivery. \n    - Legal entity and contract term extraction from documents. \n    - Wound identification & tissue classification.\n    - The usual LLM and agent stuff. (I'd love to work on effective executive functioning)\n    - Your nasty problem here. I use the normal stacks you'd expect. Python, Pytorch, Spark/ray, Jupyter/Merimo, AWS, Postgres, Mathematica and whatever else is needed to get the job done. Ultimately it's about the problem, not the tools. I have years of experience helping companies plan, prototype, and productionize sane data science solutions.\nGet in touch if you have a problem, my email is in my profile. reply",

But the majority has been with laravel. Most front end experience is with vuejs and angular. About me:\nI have roughly 10 years of experience as a full stack developer. Outside of this i have 3 years of experience teaching at coding boot camps and adjuncting at a local college. I absolutely love build tools and sites that people enjoy using. I always joke that I design functional potatoes. But that doesn't mean I can't make something pretty. Lol At my current place of employment I have taken the place of the go to guy for llms and agents. I frequently spend time learning how they work and going over research papers. Currently I'm working on automating video creation for advertisers. Some key accomplishments over that last two years are: complete overhaul and redesign of a front end, automated 25% of all requests for a specific workflow (final output is on par with human output), fully automated process that required user approval before being sent out.

I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator. I was previously the first analytics hire at a Computer Vision startup, Roboflow. Before that, I was co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things. I'm primarily looking for data leadership or technical product roles. I enjoy ideating solutions, building MVPs, experimentation, and orchestrating all of the work to achieve a strategic vision. I prefer a 70/30 split between leader/IC. I prefer smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up. Despite my background, I'd like to avoid working in the advertising space. reply",

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. Further, I'm also interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

      "title": "Ask HN: Quality of recent gens of Dell/Lenovo laptops worse than 10 years ago?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I got a Dell XPS for work a couple years ago on someone's recommendation... one of my worst-ever decisions. The touchpad sucks and routinely breaks requiring restarts, constantly having driver issues (and you have to deal with the capital-N Nightmare that is SupportAssist for drivers), graphics card is busted and makes the display driver crash once a month. Power states are completely broken. Laptop will randomly turn on when it's in my bag and rev up to ten thousand degrees. Laptop will randomly, when on full battery and closed, decide to hard-shutoff leading to a windows recovery boot. Decides to do BIOS updates when it's at 3% battery in the middle of the night, then when I wake up for work the next morning it has to go through a ten-minute recovery sequence. Battery is swelling after only a couple years of use, which sometimes causes keys on the keyboard to stop working. In the middle of a slack convo I've had to type \"Sorrymyspacebarstoppedworkinggottarestartmycomputer\". BSODs, hard drive corruption, you name it. Never buy Dell. Not that there's many good options out there unless you're willing to drop two week's pay on a Framework - but anything is better than Dell. EDIT: Another I thought of - sound card is busted and sounds like it has a low pass filter on it. I know it's not a speaker issue because on occasion it magically fixes itself until the next restart. reply",

I have stopped using Apple laptops more than 15 years ago and since then I have used only Linux laptops. I have no idea whether hibernate worked on my laptops, because this is a feature for which I have never felt any need. I always take care to optimize the boot time on my computers with custom built kernels and carefully selected daemons (and I do not use systemd). For decades, the boot time on my laptops had been of perhaps twenty seconds at most and the biggest delay in starting to use the computers after being powered off is entering a password to unlock them, not the start-up of the OS. Using something like hibernation instead of complete power off would speed up negligibly the process of beginning to work on the computer. reply",

Rebooted and everything seemed to be working smoothly again but it was... concerning so I left it running overnight. Came back to YET ANOTHER BSOD the next morning and was like F### this.

The bottom cover doesn't have access panels anymore, but it's got just a few captive(!!) screws and the whole bottom comes off. Everything is neatly exposed and you don't need to access the top of the board at all. The bottom cover has plastic clips along with the screws, but they're spring loaded! They aren't simply molded in and cannot snap off. It's some incredible attention to detail. I've noticed that most recent laptops have the vent behind the screen hinge where it's completely blocked if the screen is closed. Thinkpad has the vent fully exposed. In fact, it exposes more vent when the screen is closed. Too bad the CPU is a lemon. One of the new AMD chips with a built in NPU. The NPU is slower than the integrated graphics for inference. Not a discrete card, just the GPU baked into the chip. In contrast, I got a hand-me-down Dell XPS-something from 2020 when I first started this job. It idles IDLES! at 100°C. I tried to re-paste the CPU, but the heat pipes were so small and thin that I crushed one between my fingers. Even with massive airflow through the case from external fans, it never drops below 100C. Absolutely inexcusable. Looks to me like Lenovo still has it. At least if you're paying real money for a professional level machine. This new Thinkpad is now my #1 most repairable and maintainable machine. T530 is a close second. Absolutely every other laptop I've ever used is tied for last place in the garbage. reply",

The laptop itself has a frame of metal and a shell of plastic. It's definitely not light, one of those laptops in the 3 kg category (6 lbs?) and definitely not cheap. It's also built for total repairability: it opens with no screws and I can replace everything even the CPU and the GPU l. I replaced the HDD and the DVD with 2 SSDs, maxed out the RAM to 32 GB and replaced the keyboard many times, when keys eventually wear and start to fail. I'd buy it again, with modern components (NVME bus, DDR5 RAM) and without the number pad so I can center the space bar and the touchpad. reply",

They are not perfect, but the different models (from cheapo plastic-case 12/13 inch to top-of-the-line metal cased \"16 inch desktop replacements\" lappies and low to mid-level desktops) have been better built, and more easily serviced, than comparable Lenovo, Dell & Acer models I've had my hands on in the same time. Our new MSP pushed Lenovos on us for a batch of 25 or so computers including my latest laptop, and I regret it. They just didn't have a 15\" metal case in the price range so I got a plastic 16\". Overall performance is lower than comparably spec'd HP Z-Book Fireflys I was using, when this Thinkpad T16 G4 hits the upper limits of RAM, it feels like it's using swap on a slow platter drive. Even on lower-spec HP Pro & EliteBooks, they slow down at max RAM but don't just freeze. Our staff thrashes the shit out of gear, so finding decently-priced lower-spec metal-bodied laptops is essential. Even on latest HP laptops I am able to replace RAM, batteries, SSDs without dealing with epoxied sockets. Haven't had to often, but displays and keyboards could be swapped if absolutely needed last time we had to several years ago. That said, the performance of onboard HP Bluetooth sucks compared to others I've used and their stock bloatware is terrible. Specific to Lenovo, when I was shopping for a bunch of laptops about 3 years ago there were weird gotchas like \"I can get every spec I need EXCEPT backlit keyboard, which kicks me up to the next model, at least $300 more/unit\" and \"Gee, they solder in a low amount of RAM on this one to make you...yup, spend at least $300 more/unit\"... reply",

I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I started buying 4x4 mini PCs.  They're exactly what you describe.  For $600 I got an 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 8745H with 96GB of RAM from Minisforum.  The graphics aren't half bad and the overall system has been really good.  It's even got better thermal performance than the Intel 4x4 I had previously and generally runs 10C cooler for the same workloads. If you don't absolutely need a \"backpack portable\" computer I can only highly recommend them. reply",

          "text": "I would say yes. Having been a big fan of Dell and having used it's laptops for both professional and personal uses over many years, I have moved off it to Acer. Couple of reasons - the first is that there is a price premium which I cannot seem to justify and second is the teething / niggling issues which I have had to face in pretty much every Dell I have owned. Sometime, it will be too long a time to wake up from sleep or a random crash which requires me to fetch bitlocker key from my account so that I can boot it up again to driver update issues to the fan continuously running for no reason etc. I had, by chance, a good experience with Acer in the past and since then have purchased a couple fo them more and the experience has been seamless and pleasant. I do hope Dell ups its game as it was an iconic and innovative brand but there is less now to differentiate it from competition and so no reason for the premium to be charged. reply",

          "text": "Sounds like Dells chargers are garbage. Yet another reason to stay away from Dell in that case. Never had this issue with any charger in my life. Everything USB should still take normal 5 volts, which any charger should provide without needing negotiation, and anything larger that actually needs more juice also should have the appropriate electronics to handle that (i.e. it's a phone or a laptop or a tablet or similarly expensive device). If you have devices that don't fall into either of those categories, so they don't take normal 5 volts, or they need more juice but are picky about USB, I'd consider them faulty from the get-go, as it's clear they haven't actually implemented USB-PD in any meaningful way. And if your charger doesn't provide 5 volts without asking, it too is faulty. It's hard to go wrong with charging cables when it comes to USB-C. I agree there's a mess on the data side, but the USB Forum can't even get its head straight with what it should even be called, so it's no wonder nobody there has the balls to mandate colour coding or something similarly helpful. reply",

I only had to change it as I felt I needed a better screen and performance. The Intel processor was showing its age. I have only minor complaints running Thinkpad with Ubuntu.

I bought a newer one in 2022 and sold it again a couple of months later because, although it had a faster processor and more RAM, it felt flimsier. I'm also currently upgrading a refurbed Lenovo X270 for my granddaughter who's starting high school, and I am thoroughly impressed. Newer Lenovos are slimmer and slicker, but this thing will still be trucking after the cockroach apocalypse. reply",

          "text": "I got my first Dell laptop, the XPS15, 5 years ago.  Prior to that I had a good 25 years as a Thinkpad die-hard.  The XPS has been ... ok.  I've had some issues with it resetting for no apparent reason over its life.  Frequency varies, but sometimes it'll just blank the screens and then the BIOS comes up on the display, a few times a week, then it'll be good for a month or more. I had one issue where I needed to ship it back: it would reset and then it was running off the battery, and no matter what port I plugged a charger/docking station into it wouldn't charge until I powered it off and back on again.  I got them to do a replacement under warranty a couple years ago. Around a month ago it was doing the reset fairly frequently and then wouldn't power on sometimes, and I noticed the wrist rest was a little bowed.  I replaced the battery pack (kind  of a pain, but not the worst I've done), and it was good for around a month, but now it has that \"won't charge the battery\" issue again.  I believe when they did the previous repair they replaced the motherboard, but now I'm out of warranty. For my next laptop I kind of want a Framework, so I can replace the mobo if I need to.  My work likes us to replace hardware no more frequently than every 5-6 years, but we get a warranty for way less than that (my laptop I pushed to get a 4 year). Meanwhile my previous Thinkpad T470s is still going strong, though the screen just developed a line through it.  That's ~10 year old now. My personal 4 year old Macbook has been a real workhorse, never had any hardware issues with it.  My son's macbook has been another story, he's had that in for service 4-5 times in the 3 years he's had it.  But, I suspect that is more him than the hardware.  I don't baby my MBP, but he is just terrible with things.  He's lucky if a pair of glasses can last 6 months, ditto with a phone (usually broken screens), so I'm not sure I can blame the MB Air... reply",

And yeah my 470S is still pretty strong. I started to use it again for my side projects.

Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.

You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes, deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when sites change. The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you will build need to be performant and maintainable. You should have solid Python skills and experience scraping ecommerce websites and APIs. You should also like the slightly-obsessive investigative nature of the work.

Our work consists of a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts. Our principles are here: https://futo.org/about/what-is-futo/ Machine Learning Engineer - FUTO Keyboard FUTO Keyboard is a privacy-first software keyboard for Android. Every prediction inference routine runs entirely on-device; no user data can ever leave the device. We support over 150 keyboard layouts and languages, and over 700 layout + language combinations (not all of them include dictionary or predictions) Swipe typing is an important part of the mobile typing experience for many. Applying machine learning here poses a unique challenge due to the requirement of needing to support so many layouts and languages, as well as user-added personal dictionary words (or even layout customizations!), with limited data. We have previously collected and publicly released a US English QWERTY dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/ We are looking for a machine-learning researcher or engineer to work through these challenges and help us improve the swipe typing experience in FUTO Keyboard.

Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026. As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO).  Now that we have thousands of customers, I have many other responsibilities and need to bring on a fulltime engineer (you!) to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  Together, you and I will add obfuscation, improve our interpreter, possibly re-write method dispatch, etc.  You don’t need to be a compiler/runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code. If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other large open source project, are compiler/runtime curious, and want to work at a growing startup, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding. We’re a small, senior team, making something people want. Tech: GCP, Cloudflare, React, Dart, C++, Rust.

          "text": "The biggest thing to be aware of honestly is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Essentially, .NET Core has dropped the \"Core\" moniker. It's just .NET (I tend to refer to it as .NET proper when differentiating between Framework). This change began with .NET 5.0. If you're starting from scratch, you will want to build everything using .NET now. Do not use .NET Framework unless absolutely necessary. Probably the most common reason you'd be stuck using .NET Framework is because your project is reliant on some driver or library that isn't making the transition to .NET proper. If you're in this situation, you should try to move as much stuff as you can to be on .NET proper and then use .NET Standard , a middle man library Microsoft developed for this exact situation, to allow for cohesion between .NET Framework and .NET proper. Otherwise, in terms of specific \"modern\" coding practices? I'd say to pay attention to modern OOP approaches in general. Dependency Injection seems to be used everywhere now. Also, be careful using Reflection. People get a lot done with it really fast, but if it starts being used for more than just attribute inspection and you're doing some crazy shit with it, that's usually a sign of a bigger architectural issue. Lastly, review LINQ if it's been a while for you. Specifically, understand deferred execution as a lot of people shoot themselves in the foot by tacking on a `.ToList()` and enumerating over a massive collection they shouldn't be enumerating over. C# has changed a lot, but it's more subtle than the way a lot of other languages have progressed. Mostly just new features that you can survive very easily without. C# 14 is bringing some interesting changes though, but that's still pretty new, so I'd see the release notes on that if you're interested. reply",

That art/originality is fading, that technology is causing more harm than good, and that most jobs now exist to feed some mindless machine where sole goal is to get people addicted. Tech roles feel drained of purpose, and non-tech roles are being eaten away.<p>This outlook is a stark contrast to the era I grew up in. From 2010 to 2020, tech optimism was at its peak. Despite the flaws, companies like Airbnb, Uber, Amazon, and countless SaaS startups felt like they were genuinely improving things—breaking old monopolies and building better systems.<p>Now we have AI, arguably the most transformative technology of our lifetime, yet a lot of times the reaction seems to be exhaustion rather than excitement. Sure, people love using it, but unlike the early Internet, AI doesn't seem like a medium for creativity. The core value feels just about compressing the time it takes to do what we were already doing.<p>Maybe it’s age. Maybe it’s just me. And maybe I am bitten by false nostalgia. But I’m curious: how are others seeing this shift?</p></p></p></div>",

My view of technical climate change is: it's usually good for the ordinary, educated people in the first few decades, because diversity and competition make the old caste difficult to keep up so they need to adjust and wait until the whole movement slows down. And then they swallow the whole thing down. We have had a good run and now it is time for them to reap the fruits. The other thing that I'm a bit more worried is, each technological advance first IMPROVES but eventually REDUCES the rate of success of violent revolutions. And violent revolution is the antidote for human societies. reply",

          "text": "I like to read about the Industrial Revolution a lot, and I think a thing that’s lost in the the way we talk about luddites was the change from guild/skilled labor to factory labor.  Software engineering is a lot like that old guild labor, you understand the whole of your craft (at the time called “mysteries”) and work to build things understanding that entirety. When things changed to factory / assembly lines, sure,  products got a lot cheaper and more plentiful for everyone else, but if you were a blacksmith or stone mason or etc.  you lost both your middle class income, status in society, and day to day joy from being an expert with autonomy — we talk a lot about how engineers value autonomy when building engineering cultures. With AI that’s starting to slip away. I actually think the twentieth century is a global culture-tech inflection point, and while I’m reluctant to say things will just continue to get worse (there are a lot of years ahead of us and lots of eras and changes to go through). The one thing I’m sure of is that for all the benefits technological change brings they’re not evenly distributed. So as many I think have pointed out, if you like spending 8+ hours a day on the nuts and bolts of software engineering, and you’re really invested in the sort of late nineties to early 2020’s technological paradigm, subjectively —- things are probably getting worse from here on out. reply",

          "text": "A lot of art from the middle ages is anonymous. Painting itself is an extension of the artist, containing the intension of the person producing it and hence no name is necessary. This is a theoretical state of quality, where activity is not measured in numbers or on a scale but is seen as expression of a particular unique human being. Then comes the renaissance and painters begin to attach names to their works. Here starts a crucial shift - a turn from quality to quantity. Certain artists are better than others and hence quality itself is now measured (quantified) using a name of the person. After that the name becomes so prevalent that some works begin to be valuable only because a certain name was responsible in producing that work. Think - Picasso. Quantity starts to take over. Then comes film and comics and ads where the painter is expected to have no  individuality, and he is praised for having a style and technique that is replaceable. Same is true for corporate software development by the way. Here the name (the intermediate state connecting quality and quantity) starts to disappear and is often replaced by a name of a \"golem\" - a corporation. Quantity dominates - more and faster is better, and the more \"nameless\" the better. Ten years ago one might think that this is the limit of dehumanisation and it cannot move any further. But now we have AI - where a work of art (or other kind of work) cannot be associated with any quality (cannot be given a name) in principle. And quantity (more, faster, cheaper) dominates. When you think in these terms, the \"techno-optimism\" is just a place somewhere in this arrow moving from quality to quantity. Or in other words moving from a qualitative anonymity (my work is an extension of my being) to quantitative anonymity (the work is not associated with any being). Hence, it is not a stable position. reply",

          "text": "I see it.  I think that a couple of large things happened in the larger society, and tech is inside of that. The American Dream kind of died.  It died in two ways, and it's important to keep them separate. First, the American Dream died (or at least got very sick) in that the path from high school graduate to high-paying job got very narrow.  This was because other countries rebuilt after WWII, and outsourcing happened, and the US culture changed from more \"we're all in this together\" to more \"I got mine, you can starve\". Second, the American Dream died even for those who got the well-paid jobs.  They found out that it wasn't enough - that they needed something more than more money.  Material prosperity is not enough, and more material prosperity won't fix it.  Humans need something more, and we aren't getting it. We're not getting it from technology, either.  We don't need better graphics and instant movies.  We don't even need social media - or at least, we don't need what social media has turned into, making us a slave to dopamine hits. With that going on, how do people view tech?  As a way to get rich?  Well, that's probably not going to work out, at least not for most of us, and even if it does, all it gets me is money.  As a means of making the world better?  Yeah, how's that working out? We're feeling the lack of something, and money isn't going to fix it, and tech isn't either. I think that's what changed.  People thought that tech could make the world better, and make them rich along the way, and now they see that tech can't fix what we need fixed, and being rich isn't enough. reply",

My particular concerns are around atrophy of basic skills (reading, research, writing, etc.,) the authenticity/trustworthiness of \"knowledge\" obtained from various Internet sources (misinformation, fake news, deep fakes,) and lack of personal contact and interaction in a world where peoples' only connection to others is through a screen (fakebook, instagram, tiktok, etc..)

I didn't have to try to convince myself then. All of the ideas we thought were going to lead to something cool have been weaponized against us to maximize corporate profits. How many apps do you actually use on your phone? The theory was cool, the reality is it's a little addiction slab not really used for the 'cool' ideas. Airbnb exploited loopholes in local laws to move hospitality into neighborhoods, with detriment to them. Amazon literally has a plan for when it runs out of low paid workers because it is so bad. Yet it's plan isn't 'be a less shitty company to work for'. If you did home automation stuff, how much of that is still around, working, and useful? I have a really complex system to turn my front light on at dusk using the internet, something a light sensor did at my parents house in the 90s. And that's about all I have left working. When you stop your car at a stoplight, and instead of having buttons you have a big screen with an ad, that is also selling all of your movement info, are you experiencing progress? Netflix, Amazon, etc use to have algorithms that made what you wanted rise to the top. They now all make what Netflix/Amazon/etc want rise to the top. Every tech company's main focus is 'how shitty can I get away with if shitty gets me more money'? Instead of giving me relevant, they now either sell add positions (Amazon) or chose position based on how profitable it is to them (Netflix/Spotify financial/licensing considerations come above an algo taylored for me like they used to have). We literally have seperate recipes from American companies now. Slop for the domestic American market, and the 1990s actual food grade recipes for Europe. For our grains now, instead of traditional harvesting, we spray Roundup/glyphosate (tested and approved for earlier in the crop cycle) to kill the wheat/etc to better control harvest. We literally added as a final step for our food to pour questionable glyphosate/herbicides on it all. America now has more private equity than McDonalds, build on a business model that would have made Reagan era cocaine filled corporate raiders blush. What once made for scandals for movies is now more common than McDonalds. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/private-equity-consolidation... reply",

          "text": "I think the future is both bright and dark. It has never been this easy to create anything yourself. Anything from software to hardware, you can buy and build the tools and make something amazing in your spare time that would only 20 years ago would take a small team with some funding. There are 2 kinds of companies:\n1. The greedy kind that always want more. They see extracting money out of their customers as their sole purpose.\n2. The kind that want to build good stuff and help people. A lot of companies start out as nr 2, but with time and growth, greedy people have a tendency to climb the ladder and turn the nr 2 companies into nr 1 unless the original team knows about this and resist such change. This also means that the founders must be okay living their whole life without owning a Bugatti. VC companies make it hard to stay as nr 2, because even if you are good, if you make a deal with a VC firm that wants to 100x their investment through you, then you have already let the greedy devil through the front door. A nr 1 company will over time turn into a parasite. Once they extract more value than they give, it is a downward spiral of destruction on the way down. A big part of the US tech economy (as seen from Europe) have \"evolved\" into parasites. They say they fuel the economy. What they actually mean is that they cause a lot of money to flow around. A parasite that suck a lot of blood will also make a lot of blood flow, so it is not a good measurement of health. The good news are that parasites die eventually. A lot of people (especially outside US) are very much aware about how toxic american companies have become. In Europe there is right now a whole sector growing rapidly that is doing \"X but European\" and it looks very promising. This is not only a Europe thing, the same is happening in Asia, but European laws and culture have accelerated it. What this means is that you will see a lot of destruction and downfall as these giant parasites have to die or kill their hosts. Don't be the host. Don't rely on them. Don't do business with them. Don't work for them. Avoid them like the plague, and don't stand in their way when they fall. They will cause collateral damage, regulators should have stepped in a long time ago, but greed prevented that. These companies are already leaving big billion dollar holes in the market. They can't win those markets back, because in business trust is everything and they have lost trust from these markets. As they continue falling, they need to continue sucking out more blood of their remaining hosts which will further erode trust and create new bigger markets looking for a non toxic alternative. Be that alternative. It has never been easier. The future is bright if you want to. Random info: \"money is the root of all evil\" is false. It is actually \"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\". If you dig into the original bible texts, it is clear that it is not talking about money as being evil. It is talking about a spirit (mentality) that in English would be more accurately translated as \"greed\". It is very clear that greed causes destruction and suffering on all levels. From companies managing to erode the middle class to Putin wanting more land. There are companies that steal (legal with greedy corrupt leaders) water only to sell it back to the local population. Why? Greed. It caused Boeing planes to fall from the sky, it caused the 2008 crash and it will cause the AI crash. No matter how much they eat, they remain hungry without limits. This is what greed does. Greed weaponizes good companies with good ideas and turn it into a money sucking machine with no limits. If you want to resist this, you have to start with yourself. Everything starts with one person. Be that person. reply",

          "text": "Yes. It wasn't an unintended consequence. The goal of the legislation was to \"stop children from accessing age inappropriate content\" on the internet. Ahead of the legislation it was known that there would be a significant proportion of individuals who would switch to using VPN's because without platform based verification it would be a pita for users (more logins, random age verification services, and some sites just deciding to block). However, VPN's, come with their own minimum age 18 T&C's, as do the means of payment for those services (credit and debit). So from the pov of \"stop children from accessing age inappropriate content\" similar result Not perfect, but empirically this seems to be working well enough e.g. \"New data shows no rise in children’s VPN use after the introduction of online age checks\" ( https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/research/data-shows-no-r... ), i.e. the VPN traffic is largely adults. As to other unintended consequences, such as making it more difficult for the authorities to snoop on their citizens, I doubt this effectively makes any difference whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Setting this up through your router / network infra is one possible path. Another AU citizen here. I've been beefing up our home in prep for these laws too. You can use policy based routing to send traffic through a few VPN egress points depending on either domain, or IP based country lookup. Most providers will let you keep simultaneous connections up. This then applies to all devices so streaming apps works well (e.g. for my partner to access her home country's public broadcaster) and any complexity remains hidden from others you live with. From there, a wireguard tunnel for personal devices back through home means you can keep these same paths active when mobile. I'm looking forward to the level of networking and systems knowledge these laws will encourage across future generations. reply",

I recommend reading about authoritarian regimes in Europe (it was not just Germany) and how they controlled discourse, and what people had accessed to.

Them being able to serve up step-sister roleplay slop in two clicks isn't something I care about protecting. I doubt they said that comment about Pornhub specifically, maybe, but I can believe driving certain sites out of business being part of the intention, barely moderated suicide discussion forums filled with teenagers for one. I will read about that, but I quite quickly realised talking about this in person it's one of the few things I feel this strongly about, and even I'm not sure why I agree so entirely.

There’s a four month waiting list for licensing due to backlogs at the local County Court. The alternative is therefore to use up a strike and apply to have the account repurposed back to a Citizen User Account.  CUAs must remain below a 50:1 down/up ratio and must have p90 non-https “control” traffic of 48kbps or less.  They are expensive too but you get a 25% discount if you install your ISP’s mobileconfig / MDM profile though.  With the profile discount the price is now only £64.99 a month. (This assumes you run an Approved Platform capable of mobile device management.  Anything else — Linux based, old versions of macOS, Windows <= 13 etc. — has to pay the full price and CUAs are limited to one Custom Access device per connection.) You can get it down to £49.99 a month if you sign up for a 12-month trial of their home security system — cameras, door “e-locks”, that sort of thing.  The devices are locked down but you can see the last 48h of events on their cloud portal.  The devices have tamper detectors and the traffic is encrypted e2e but luckily that doesn’t count towards your CUA agreement’s limits on opaque traffic. reply",

Not only are the UK and EU exerting pressure against US companies to change their global policies, but especially in the case of the UK, they are attempting to change the legal framework governing the internet by claiming that sites are somehow subject to UK law unless they proactively block the UK. All this on top of long time EU/UK participation in shady “counter-misinformation” efforts that have spun up a web of state-funded NGOs who attempt to influence US policy against freedom of information.

The idea of a global internet is becoming increasingly infeasible and I believe that China is just ahead of its time. If you look at the UK, it is really just a matter of time until they figure out that the real issue they are having is that, the Internet allows communication with entities they can not enforce their laws on.

The Investigatory Powers Act governs how and when data can be requested by law enforcement and other relevant agencies. It includes robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy, ensuring that data is accessed only in exceptional cases and only when necessary and proportionate. The suggestion that cybersecurity and access to data by law enforcement are at odds is false.

          "text": "Currently, making a site accessible is more like a strong linter and a few standard UX elements (skip to content, etc.) Typically your tasks are things like: Increase the contrast on these 11 fonts, add missing labels, ensure keyboard navigation works. It is more of a checklist-type set of actions than a framework or library. But it was supposed to be evolving, at least from a regulatory perspective. The Office of Civil Rights in the DOJ owns enforcement of this, and that team is pretty friendly and reasonable. Or was a few years ago... I haven't talked to them since the current administration came in, so don't what what their current state is. In any case, their plan a couple years ago was to stop making it about checklists and accessibility checkers and work towards a broader goal of \"Make the UX as good for people with limits as it is for people without limits.\" They wanted to get away from, for example, solutions that would meet the letter of the law by making a non-mouse user hit tab 117 times when a mouse user only had to do one click. So if you are really trying to do accessibility well, that is the perspective to embrace - not \"give me a tool that fulfills a checklist\", but \"Make UX equitable for all.\" reply",

We did enough to cover our bases, maybe 80-90% of the way there, but that’s it. I mean emotionally I get it. But it’s a business at the end of the day.

Phrasing like this just confirms to me there’s no nuance.<p>Are these the current ethics in Y Combinator?</p></p></p></div>",

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

Email: camerongu3@gmail.com --- Full stack web dev here with a bias towards the backend. On my own time I prefer to use python for web work and GDScript/Godot for game dev, but I'm a big proponent of using the right tools for the job. I'm good at turning domain knowledge into software and quickly getting up to speed on preexisting code bases. Ideally looking for a role doing something socially conscious. * At my last job I led a team and helped build a Windows desktop app that pulled data from native node modules and added overlays to games. I used Electron, Node, Typescript, React, and Redux to build it, AWS for CI/deployments, and finally TrackJS and Sentry for logging/monitoring. I also started learning Rust from working with other engineers on the native node modules. reply",

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a entry or mid-level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only.

Resume: https://mbrigdan.github.io/mbrigdan/resume.pdf Email: mbrigdan@gmail.com -- Hi folks, I'm Matt. About 7 years of experience working at the interface between data science and backend development. My most recent work has been around optimization of grid-scale energy storage systems - I was the technical lead for the team's first go-live in the ERCOT power market. A lot of experience taking something functional but bespoke (think e.g. a Jupyter notebook from a DS researcher) and applying rigorous software engineering principles to make it modular/scalable/maintainable, and dealing with the problems that result from applying machine learning in the real world (e.g. robustness to forecast error). Primarily experienced in Python but I've learned a lot of languages at this point and don't mind learning new tools that fit that job. Not afraid to get my hands dirty deep in the guts of algorithms/statistics/mathematics, my background is in electrical engineering with some signal processing experience. I've got years of math skills crying out to be used! I'm looking for a role that lets me sink my teeth into challenging problems - some kind of math/statistical analysis/optimization/algorithmic bent would be ideal, I get a great kick out of testing out cutting edge new libraries, implementing an algorithm from a new research paper, that kind of thing. Would love to connect, even if just for networking. reply",

I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts.

Various Javascript frameworks as they come and go: React, Svelte, Vue. DevOps with Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure. Résumé/CV: https://resume.sadauskas.com/ Email: psadauskas@gmail.com There’s an inflection point in every startup, where you’ve got your MVP and first customers, and now you need to scale everything. You need to make the application faster while also adding features and fixing bugs. You need to grow the whole team, not just engineering, and build the tools to support them. This is where I’m in my groove. I’ve grown teams from 3 to 100+, improved performance while scaling to 100x the load, and designed and built features from the ground up in an iterative and agile manner to minimize time-to-delivery while maximizing flexibility for future work. I have over 20 years of experience as a full-stack web application developer, primarily as a Rails developer since its inception. I also have experience with a large variety of languages, frameworks and technologies. I’m comfortable working at entire levels of the app stack, from CSS to SQL. I have the experience to know when to hack together a quick solution, or take the time to architect a foundation that will scale and provide a platform upon which the team can build stable features for years. If you’re an early stage startup that has found product/market fit, and needs someone to scale both your product and your team, then I’d be a great choice to help you out. reply",

Also the ranking went up during that period! * Using LLM rewrites to generate better product pages driving higher conversion and higher traffic * Created a full-stack web app showcasing our bespoke offerings, which halves the time to close the deal (before this, obtaining a price took a while) * Used triple exponential smoothing to predict supply and demand, showcasing the gap for our company to drive more supply to * Created my own project management dashboard so that certain weak PM skills I have are actually quite okay now :) reply",

All I want for christmas is some gnarly problems to chew on, otherwise it's coal for Christmas. I'm a data scientist with 20+ years experience who enjoys gnarly, avant-garde problems. I saved a well known German automaker from lemon law recalls. I've worked with a major cloud vendor to predict when servers would fail, allowing them to load shed in time. Some of the things I've done: - Live chip counting for estmating betting in casinos.\n    - Automotive part failure prediction (Lemon law recalls)\n    - Server fleet failure prediction allowing load shedding.\n    - Shipping piracy risk prediction - routing ships away from danger. \n    - Oil reservoir & well engineering forecasting production.\n    - Realtime routing (CVRP-PD-TW, shifts) for on demand delivery. \n    - Legal entity and contract term extraction from documents. \n    - Wound identification & tissue classification.\n    - The usual LLM and agent stuff. (I'd love to work on effective executive functioning)\n    - Your nasty problem here. I use the normal stacks you'd expect. Python, Pytorch, Spark/ray, Jupyter/Merimo, AWS, Postgres, Mathematica and whatever else is needed to get the job done. Ultimately it's about the problem, not the tools. I have years of experience helping companies plan, prototype, and productionize sane data science solutions.\nGet in touch if you have a problem, my email is in my profile. reply",

I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator. I was previously the first analytics hire at a Computer Vision startup, Roboflow. Before that, I was co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things. I'm primarily looking for data leadership or technical product roles. I enjoy ideating solutions, building MVPs, experimentation, and orchestrating all of the work to achieve a strategic vision. I prefer a 70/30 split between leader/IC. I prefer smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up.

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. Further, I'm also interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I got a Dell XPS for work a couple years ago on someone's recommendation... one of my worst-ever decisions. The touchpad sucks and routinely breaks requiring restarts, constantly having driver issues (and you have to deal with the capital-N Nightmare that is SupportAssist for drivers), graphics card is busted and makes the display driver crash once a month. Power states are completely broken. Laptop will randomly turn on when it's in my bag and rev up to ten thousand degrees. Laptop will randomly, when on full battery and closed, decide to hard-shutoff leading to a windows recovery boot. Decides to do BIOS updates when it's at 3% battery in the middle of the night, then when I wake up for work the next morning it has to go through a ten-minute recovery sequence. Battery is swelling after only a couple years of use, which sometimes causes keys on the keyboard to stop working. In the middle of a slack convo I've had to type \"Sorrymyspacebarstoppedworkinggottarestartmycomputer\". BSODs, hard drive corruption, you name it. Never buy Dell. Not that there's many good options out there unless you're willing to drop two week's pay on a Framework - but anything is better than Dell. EDIT: Another I thought of - sound card is busted and sounds like it has a low pass filter on it. I know it's not a speaker issue because on occasion it magically fixes itself until the next restart. reply",

I have stopped using Apple laptops more than 15 years ago and since then I have used only Linux laptops. I have no idea whether hibernate worked on my laptops, because this is a feature for which I have never felt any need. I always take care to optimize the boot time on my computers with custom built kernels and carefully selected daemons (and I do not use systemd). For decades, the boot time on my laptops had been of perhaps twenty seconds at most and the biggest delay in starting to use the computers after being powered off is entering a password to unlock them, not the start-up of the OS. Using something like hibernation instead of complete power off would speed up negligibly the process of beginning to work on the computer. reply",

          "text": "I recently got a new Thinkpad for work, can't recall which model. I think L series? The build quality is nicer than my T530. The bottom cover doesn't have access panels anymore, but it's got just a few captive(!!) screws and the whole bottom comes off. Everything is neatly exposed and you don't need to access the top of the board at all. The bottom cover has plastic clips along with the screws, but they're spring loaded! They aren't simply molded in and cannot snap off. It's some incredible attention to detail. I've noticed that most recent laptops have the vent behind the screen hinge where it's completely blocked if the screen is closed. Thinkpad has the vent fully exposed. In fact, it exposes more vent when the screen is closed. Too bad the CPU is a lemon. One of the new AMD chips with a built in NPU. The NPU is slower than the integrated graphics for inference. Not a discrete card, just the GPU baked into the chip. In contrast, I got a hand-me-down Dell XPS-something from 2020 when I first started this job. It idles IDLES! at 100°C. I tried to re-paste the CPU, but the heat pipes were so small and thin that I crushed one between my fingers. Even with massive airflow through the case from external fans, it never drops below 100C. Absolutely inexcusable. Looks to me like Lenovo still has it. At least if you're paying real money for a professional level machine. This new Thinkpad is now my #1 most repairable and maintainable machine. T530 is a close second. Absolutely every other laptop I've ever used is tied for last place in the garbage. reply",

But, sadly, next generations went deep shit instead. Nowadays, I have a very hard time selecting a laptop that would fit my needs, even disregarding the price.\nOne of the worst feature in term of offender is the keyboard: Manufacturers are going on with this totally stupid unergonomic trend of having \"half size\" enter keys, removing page-up/page-down keys, and hiding directional arrows behind over keys needing to use the \"FN+other_key\" to be able to use the arrow. reply",

By cheap I mean 300 or 400 Euro and by expensive I mean 800 or 1000 Euro or more. Some laptops that flex are made of metal, some that do not flex are made of plastic. My HP ZBook 15 from 2014 is rock solid and does not flex even if it's mostly plastic. There is a catch: the keyboard is built with a sheet of metal on the bottom, so it's very rigid. The laptop itself has a frame of metal and a shell of plastic. It's definitely not light, one of those laptops in the 3 kg category (6 lbs?) and definitely not cheap. It's also built for total repairability: it opens with no screws and I can replace everything even the CPU and the GPU l. I replaced the HDD and the DVD with 2 SSDs, maxed out the RAM to 32 GB and replaced the keyboard many times, when keys eventually wear and start to fail. I'd buy it again, with modern components (NVME bus, DDR5 RAM) and without the number pad so I can center the space bar and the touchpad. reply",

          "text": "I've had about 400 Windows HP laptops/200 desktops through my hands running IT for a nonprofit. They are not perfect, but the different models (from cheapo plastic-case 12/13 inch to top-of-the-line metal cased \"16 inch desktop replacements\" lappies and low to mid-level desktops) have been better built, and more easily serviced, than comparable Lenovo, Dell & Acer models I've had my hands on in the same time. Our new MSP pushed Lenovos on us for a batch of 25 or so computers including my latest laptop, and I regret it. They just didn't have a 15\" metal case in the price range so I got a plastic 16\". Overall performance is lower than comparably spec'd HP Z-Book Fireflys I was using, when this Thinkpad T16 G4 hits the upper limits of RAM, it feels like it's using swap on a slow platter drive. Even on lower-spec HP Pro & EliteBooks, they slow down at max RAM but don't just freeze. Our staff thrashes the shit out of gear, so finding decently-priced lower-spec metal-bodied laptops is essential. Even on latest HP laptops I am able to replace RAM, batteries, SSDs without dealing with epoxied sockets. Haven't had to often, but displays and keyboards could be swapped if absolutely needed last time we had to several years ago. That said, the performance of onboard HP Bluetooth sucks compared to others I've used and their stock bloatware is terrible. Specific to Lenovo, when I was shopping for a bunch of laptops about 3 years ago there were weird gotchas like \"I can get every spec I need EXCEPT backlit keyboard, which kicks me up to the next model, at least $300 more/unit\" and \"Gee, they solder in a low amount of RAM on this one to make you...yup, spend at least $300 more/unit\"... reply",

Sometime, it will be too long a time to wake up from sleep or a random crash which requires me to fetch bitlocker key from my account so that I can boot it up again to driver update issues to the fan continuously running for no reason etc. I had, by chance, a good experience with Acer in the past and since then have purchased a couple fo them more and the experience has been seamless and pleasant.

Everything USB should still take normal 5 volts, which any charger should provide without needing negotiation, and anything larger that actually needs more juice also should have the appropriate electronics to handle that (i.e. it's a phone or a laptop or a tablet or similarly expensive device). If you have devices that don't fall into either of those categories, so they don't take normal 5 volts, or they need more juice but are picky about USB, I'd consider them faulty from the get-go, as it's clear they haven't actually implemented USB-PD in any meaningful way. And if your charger doesn't provide 5 volts without asking, it too is faulty. It's hard to go wrong with charging cables when it comes to USB-C. I agree there's a mess on the data side, but the USB Forum can't even get its head straight with what it should even be called, so it's no wonder nobody there has the balls to mandate colour coding or something similarly helpful. reply",

I installed Ubuntu and it almost ran out of the box but I ended up having to tinker with it to get My Dell docking station and i3 window manager to work. But that is something I was willing to live with. So far, I have had no complaints. If you’re using Linux, the sleep and standby performance aren’t good. But much better than my previous laptop. Coming to my previous laptop which I still have with me, I bought a Thinkpad L480 in 2018. It was then a dirt cheap version of a Thinkpad. But it did the job with no complaints. I had to replace the battery after 4 years but that wasn’t an issue. It did everything a daily driver is supposed to do, reliable and never threw a fit. I only had to change it as I felt I needed a better screen and performance. The Intel processor was showing its age. I have only minor complaints running Thinkpad with Ubuntu. But if you start moving away from popular distros, then you have to accept you will occasionally have to tinker to get things work. reply",

          "text": "I got my first Dell laptop, the XPS15, 5 years ago.  Prior to that I had a good 25 years as a Thinkpad die-hard.  The XPS has been ... ok.  I've had some issues with it resetting for no apparent reason over its life.  Frequency varies, but sometimes it'll just blank the screens and then the BIOS comes up on the display, a few times a week, then it'll be good for a month or more. I had one issue where I needed to ship it back: it would reset and then it was running off the battery, and no matter what port I plugged a charger/docking station into it wouldn't charge until I powered it off and back on again.  I got them to do a replacement under warranty a couple years ago. Around a month ago it was doing the reset fairly frequently and then wouldn't power on sometimes, and I noticed the wrist rest was a little bowed.  I replaced the battery pack (kind  of a pain, but not the worst I've done), and it was good for around a month, but now it has that \"won't charge the battery\" issue again.  I believe when they did the previous repair they replaced the motherboard, but now I'm out of warranty. For my next laptop I kind of want a Framework, so I can replace the mobo if I need to.  My work likes us to replace hardware no more frequently than every 5-6 years, but we get a warranty for way less than that (my laptop I pushed to get a 4 year). Meanwhile my previous Thinkpad T470s is still going strong, though the screen just developed a line through it.  That's ~10 year old now. My personal 4 year old Macbook has been a real workhorse, never had any hardware issues with it.  My son's macbook has been another story, he's had that in for service 4-5 times in the 3 years he's had it.  But, I suspect that is more him than the hardware.  I don't baby my MBP, but he is just terrible with things.  He's lucky if a pair of glasses can last 6 months, ditto with a phone (usually broken screens), so I'm not sure I can blame the MB Air... reply",

Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.

You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes, deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when sites change. The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you will build need to be performant and maintainable.

          "text": "FUTO | Austin, TX | On-site / Remote | Full Time FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologies that frustrate centralization and industry consolidation. Our work consists of a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts. Our principles are here: https://futo.org/about/what-is-futo/ Machine Learning Engineer - FUTO Keyboard FUTO Keyboard is a privacy-first software keyboard for Android. Every prediction inference routine runs entirely on-device; no user data can ever leave the device. We support over 150 keyboard layouts and languages, and over 700 layout + language combinations (not all of them include dictionary or predictions) Swipe typing is an important part of the mobile typing experience for many. Applying machine learning here poses a unique challenge due to the requirement of needing to support so many layouts and languages, as well as user-added personal dictionary words (or even layout customizations!), with limited data. We have previously collected and publicly released a US English QWERTY dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/ We are looking for a machine-learning researcher or engineer to work through these challenges and help us improve the swipe typing experience in FUTO Keyboard.

I’m optimizing for someone autonomous who can run with outreach + content. Comp: contract, €60–€120/hour depending on fit, 8–16h/week. Start with a small paid test project.

Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026. As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO).  Now that we have thousands of customers, I have many other responsibilities and need to bring on a fulltime engineer (you!) to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  Together, you and I will add obfuscation, improve our interpreter, possibly re-write method dispatch, etc.  You don’t need to be a compiler/runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code. If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other large open source project, are compiler/runtime curious, and want to work at a growing startup, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding. We’re a small, senior team, making something people want. Tech: GCP, Cloudflare, React, Dart, C++, Rust.

          "text": "The biggest thing to be aware of honestly is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Essentially, .NET Core has dropped the \"Core\" moniker. It's just .NET (I tend to refer to it as .NET proper when differentiating between Framework). This change began with .NET 5.0. If you're starting from scratch, you will want to build everything using .NET now. Do not use .NET Framework unless absolutely necessary. Probably the most common reason you'd be stuck using .NET Framework is because your project is reliant on some driver or library that isn't making the transition to .NET proper. If you're in this situation, you should try to move as much stuff as you can to be on .NET proper and then use .NET Standard , a middle man library Microsoft developed for this exact situation, to allow for cohesion between .NET Framework and .NET proper. Otherwise, in terms of specific \"modern\" coding practices? I'd say to pay attention to modern OOP approaches in general. Dependency Injection seems to be used everywhere now. Also, be careful using Reflection. People get a lot done with it really fast, but if it starts being used for more than just attribute inspection and you're doing some crazy shit with it, that's usually a sign of a bigger architectural issue. Lastly, review LINQ if it's been a while for you. Specifically, understand deferred execution as a lot of people shoot themselves in the foot by tacking on a `.ToList()` and enumerating over a massive collection they shouldn't be enumerating over. C# has changed a lot, but it's more subtle than the way a lot of other languages have progressed. Mostly just new features that you can survive very easily without. C# 14 is bringing some interesting changes though, but that's still pretty new, so I'd see the release notes on that if you're interested. reply",

The compiler will teach you a lot because the errors are extremely easy to follow. I never bought into books because too many language features have been added in the past years that improve on \"old\" ways. The only complaint I have is that Google is still the best interface for navigating the docs. Spamming google over and over. Solving this in an easily greppable way is on my wishlist.

We like the features that the WAF provides - but not at the expense of global outages. If you have a 3 9s availability SLA, you've just blown 90% of your allotted downtime because of Cloudflare's WAF.</p></p></div>",

          "text": "Ok, I'll byte... Nvidia's business is cored on selling hardware to price insensitive customers. Those customers are price insensitive because the value created with Nvidia's GPU's is a non-fractional multiple of their capital cost and the capital cost of the GPU's is a fraction of the capital cost of the overall infrastructure. And this is really important: if you maintain your margins, higher prices mean more net revenue. 30% of $2500 is less than 30% of $3000 while logistic and marketing and development costs are the same. The retail market is price sensitive but is not the core of Nvidia's business. Large price insensitive customers are what drives development direction and what goes into retail is condensed from the exhaust fumes. As a customer for RAM fabs, Nvidia drives the direction of RAM development without capital expenditure on infrastructure and R&D. It also mitigates the investment risks from political changes and disruption caused by technological breakthrough (the inertia of obsolescent RAM fabs driving design decisions). Or to put it more simply, the age where near-leading-edge GPU hardware was readily accessible to consumers are past. The leading edge is increasingly military-industrial scale...with all that implies. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "The UI matters A LOT. We are the creators who know the product inside and out to the last comma in the code. This makes us completely blind to what our users actually see. We design our UIs to be functional, because of the aforementioned. But the users have absolutely no idea what is going on under the hood. The UI is THE product to them. So as a fellow founder/architect/... i strongly urge you to hire a professional designer who will create a CONSISTENT and INTUITIVE user interface. YOU will not see much value in that but your users WILL. Personal anecdote, when I launched my last project, Gethly.com, I asked a friend to do some user stuff and give me some feedback. I very quickly realised that I had a lot of work ahead of me when he told me he had no idea how to do absolutely basic things because of the wording used in the UI(nomenclature can become a problem) or click a link that was staring him right in the face was completely invisible to him. Again, I call this \"founder's blindness\" type of thing where we are incapable of seeing our own work through user's eyes as we have too much knowledge of the whole thing and cannot even comprehend how someone would be unable to do a, in our eyes, most basic thing. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I see people all around me who have this bleak, pessimistic view of where everything is going. That art/originality is fading, that technology is causing more harm than good, and that most jobs now exist to feed some mindless machine where sole goal is to get people addicted. Tech roles feel drained of purpose, and non-tech roles are being eaten away.<p>This outlook is a stark contrast to the era I grew up in. From 2010 to 2020, tech optimism was at its peak. Despite the flaws, companies like Airbnb, Uber, Amazon, and countless SaaS startups felt like they were genuinely improving things—breaking old monopolies and building better systems.<p>Now we have AI, arguably the most transformative technology of our lifetime, yet a lot of times the reaction seems to be exhaustion rather than excitement. Sure, people love using it, but unlike the early Internet, AI doesn't seem like a medium for creativity. The core value feels just about compressing the time it takes to do what we were already doing.<p>Maybe it’s age. Maybe it’s just me. And maybe I am bitten by false nostalgia. But I’m curious: how are others seeing this shift?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I like to read about the Industrial Revolution a lot, and I think a thing that’s lost in the the way we talk about luddites was the change from guild/skilled labor to factory labor.  Software engineering is a lot like that old guild labor, you understand the whole of your craft (at the time called “mysteries”) and work to build things understanding that entirety. When things changed to factory / assembly lines, sure,  products got a lot cheaper and more plentiful for everyone else, but if you were a blacksmith or stone mason or etc.  you lost both your middle class income, status in society, and day to day joy from being an expert with autonomy — we talk a lot about how engineers value autonomy when building engineering cultures. With AI that’s starting to slip away. I actually think the twentieth century is a global culture-tech inflection point, and while I’m reluctant to say things will just continue to get worse (there are a lot of years ahead of us and lots of eras and changes to go through). The one thing I’m sure of is that for all the benefits technological change brings they’re not evenly distributed. So as many I think have pointed out, if you like spending 8+ hours a day on the nuts and bolts of software engineering, and you’re really invested in the sort of late nineties to early 2020’s technological paradigm, subjectively —- things are probably getting worse from here on out. reply",

          "text": "I'll try my theory: In the west, the last decades have been marked by prosperity. After the big wars, there was abundant energy, relative geopolitical stability, so everything was improving for everybody (we can use more energy to build more machine to produce more stuff that becomes cheaper so we own more and we are happier). Now we see that we have: 1. An energy problem (we're reaching the peak of fossil fuels, that shows in the economy, and we don't have a viable solution for saving the growth). 2. A climate problem, which means that even if we discovered an infinite source of fossil fuels that could save the growth, we would still be screwed because climate change will eventually destroy society as we know it (and probably kill many (most?) of us). 3. A biodiversity problem, which means that even if we discovered an infinite, clean energy and somehow saved the climate, the very consequence of our growth is habitat loss. We're living in a mass extinction that's orders of magnitudes faster than the one that killed the dinosaurs. It's a fact, it's measured. Say we could have a fusion reactor in our smartphones, we could still not eat it. It used to be that everything was going well, and therefore technology was just allowing us to own more and be happier. Now we realise that all of this is not sustainable. And technology is what allowed us to get where we are, and it doesn't look at all like it can save us. The sustainable way is \"doing less with less\". reply",

          "text": "A lot of art from the middle ages is anonymous. Painting itself is an extension of the artist, containing the intension of the person producing it and hence no name is necessary. This is a theoretical state of quality, where activity is not measured in numbers or on a scale but is seen as expression of a particular unique human being. Then comes the renaissance and painters begin to attach names to their works. Here starts a crucial shift - a turn from quality to quantity. Certain artists are better than others and hence quality itself is now measured (quantified) using a name of the person. After that the name becomes so prevalent that some works begin to be valuable only because a certain name was responsible in producing that work. Think - Picasso. Quantity starts to take over. Then comes film and comics and ads where the painter is expected to have no  individuality, and he is praised for having a style and technique that is replaceable. Same is true for corporate software development by the way. Here the name (the intermediate state connecting quality and quantity) starts to disappear and is often replaced by a name of a \"golem\" - a corporation. Quantity dominates - more and faster is better, and the more \"nameless\" the better. Ten years ago one might think that this is the limit of dehumanisation and it cannot move any further. But now we have AI - where a work of art (or other kind of work) cannot be associated with any quality (cannot be given a name) in principle. And quantity (more, faster, cheaper) dominates. When you think in these terms, the \"techno-optimism\" is just a place somewhere in this arrow moving from quality to quantity. Or in other words moving from a qualitative anonymity (my work is an extension of my being) to quantitative anonymity (the work is not associated with any being). Hence, it is not a stable position. reply",

          "text": "Techo-optimism peaked in the 1960s. After that people became much more cynical or realistic about technology. The last three recent major technological advances in term of impact on everyday life are the internet and mobile phone in the 1990s and then the smartphone as ushered by the iPhone in 2007. All three are intertwined and really what makes today different from 1990. Amazon is a 1990s company. In the 2010s it was fully established and a giant. It's a retail and logistics company that understood the impact and possibilities of the internet. AirBnb (founded 2008) understood and exploited that the internet and smartphone allowed a new approach to holiday lettings but isn't doing anything hard technologically. Uber (founded 2009) has done the same for taxi cabs. Nothing technologically hard but making full use of the ubiquitous smartphone. Perhaps you remember the 2010s as more exciting because it was when the smartphone was new so there was this burst of apps and services to make use of it. reply",

          "text": "Energy usage per capita peaked in america in the 1970s[1]. After that, maybe there were efficiency gains, but by using more energy you get crazy progress in the early 20th century, like doing 100x or 1000x more work per person. With efficiency gains I doubt you'll even get 2x the work in most cases. There's also the Productivity Paradox[2] where progress in IT (computers, internet, ...) didn't translate on higher productivity in society. There's different theories about this, like it being caused by the change from industrial economy to a service economy. [1] https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/04/10/176801719/two-...

          "text": "I see it.  I think that a couple of large things happened in the larger society, and tech is inside of that. The American Dream kind of died.  It died in two ways, and it's important to keep them separate. First, the American Dream died (or at least got very sick) in that the path from high school graduate to high-paying job got very narrow.  This was because other countries rebuilt after WWII, and outsourcing happened, and the US culture changed from more \"we're all in this together\" to more \"I got mine, you can starve\". Second, the American Dream died even for those who got the well-paid jobs.  They found out that it wasn't enough - that they needed something more than more money.  Material prosperity is not enough, and more material prosperity won't fix it.  Humans need something more, and we aren't getting it. We're not getting it from technology, either.  We don't need better graphics and instant movies.  We don't even need social media - or at least, we don't need what social media has turned into, making us a slave to dopamine hits. With that going on, how do people view tech?  As a way to get rich?  Well, that's probably not going to work out, at least not for most of us, and even if it does, all it gets me is money.  As a means of making the world better?  Yeah, how's that working out? We're feeling the lack of something, and money isn't going to fix it, and tech isn't either. I think that's what changed.  People thought that tech could make the world better, and make them rich along the way, and now they see that tech can't fix what we need fixed, and being rich isn't enough. reply",

          "text": "I'd say it is saturation fatigue. 20 years ago, people who were online were kinda power users. Nowadays, internet is full of normies. Nothing wrong with that but it also means competition for everything has increased ten fold. Social networks used to be filled with smart people, now they are filled with average people and smart people are now just static noise in the background. Jobs in IT are the same. Instead of 5 smart people competing for one job, now you might have hundreds and thousands and as employer you might not be able to distinguish the good/skilled one from the average one. And now employers have to hire based on your skin color instead of skill, among other things, which dilutes the potential for a company to be successful in inventing, creating, competing disrupting... You used to be able to create some fun side project and get few customers to pay your bills. Nowadays, everything is monopolised and behind red tape with insane cost of entry. Which discourages competition and creativity of an individual. Software has hit a plateau with social networks, online communication, programming languages and whatnot. Now it is all about AI(which it is not but it is being sold as such) because that is the last software paramount. Hardware stopped advancing too, mostly due to AI again. We had the smart phone revolution, tablet revolution, online video streaming revolution... then Elon Musk did some work with SapaceX(rockets + internet) and electric cars. But that is about it. Not much new came after that. Definitely nothing ground breaking or revolutionary. Again, likely because most effort and investments go into AI hardware. So we are in a limbo when it comes to both - HW and SW. We've reached peak saturation in user base, we've hit ceiling in programming and hardware and there is nothing interesting behind the corner. Maybe except new-age nuclear reactors(smaller, more efficient) and quantum computing(though that is still decades away from commercial use and production). But I think all of this is mostly because economic and demographic factors. The societies have peaked, at least the \"western\" ones, and are now heading into correction period that will stifle technological progress as the \"west\" overplayed the globalization card and has to pull back and start shifting towards manufacturing and blue collar jobs, as it became heavily service-based economically. Also it is important to factor in the feminism and DEI aspect of modern societies that is causing (white)men to graduate less, partake in STEM less, be more absent in white collar jobs, HR departments hindering creativity at the work place and so on. It's a whole bowl of spaghetti of societal issues that has to get unwound and levelled before we can bounce back up. reply",

I didn't have to try to convince myself then. All of the ideas we thought were going to lead to something cool have been weaponized against us to maximize corporate profits. How many apps do you actually use on your phone? The theory was cool, the reality is it's a little addiction slab not really used for the 'cool' ideas. Airbnb exploited loopholes in local laws to move hospitality into neighborhoods, with detriment to them. Amazon literally has a plan for when it runs out of low paid workers because it is so bad. Yet it's plan isn't 'be a less shitty company to work for'. If you did home automation stuff, how much of that is still around, working, and useful? I have a really complex system to turn my front light on at dusk using the internet, something a light sensor did at my parents house in the 90s. And that's about all I have left working. When you stop your car at a stoplight, and instead of having buttons you have a big screen with an ad, that is also selling all of your movement info, are you experiencing progress? Netflix, Amazon, etc use to have algorithms that made what you wanted rise to the top. They now all make what Netflix/Amazon/etc want rise to the top. Every tech company's main focus is 'how shitty can I get away with if shitty gets me more money'? Instead of giving me relevant, they now either sell add positions (Amazon) or chose position based on how profitable it is to them (Netflix/Spotify financial/licensing considerations come above an algo taylored for me like they used to have). We literally have seperate recipes from American companies now. Slop for the domestic American market, and the 1990s actual food grade recipes for Europe. For our grains now, instead of traditional harvesting, we spray Roundup/glyphosate (tested and approved for earlier in the crop cycle) to kill the wheat/etc to better control harvest. We literally added as a final step for our food to pour questionable glyphosate/herbicides on it all. America now has more private equity than McDonalds, build on a business model that would have made Reagan era cocaine filled corporate raiders blush.

          "text": "I think the future is both bright and dark. It has never been this easy to create anything yourself. Anything from software to hardware, you can buy and build the tools and make something amazing in your spare time that would only 20 years ago would take a small team with some funding. There are 2 kinds of companies:\n1. The greedy kind that always want more. They see extracting money out of their customers as their sole purpose.\n2. The kind that want to build good stuff and help people. A lot of companies start out as nr 2, but with time and growth, greedy people have a tendency to climb the ladder and turn the nr 2 companies into nr 1 unless the original team knows about this and resist such change. This also means that the founders must be okay living their whole life without owning a Bugatti. VC companies make it hard to stay as nr 2, because even if you are good, if you make a deal with a VC firm that wants to 100x their investment through you, then you have already let the greedy devil through the front door. A nr 1 company will over time turn into a parasite. Once they extract more value than they give, it is a downward spiral of destruction on the way down. A big part of the US tech economy (as seen from Europe) have \"evolved\" into parasites. They say they fuel the economy. What they actually mean is that they cause a lot of money to flow around. A parasite that suck a lot of blood will also make a lot of blood flow, so it is not a good measurement of health. The good news are that parasites die eventually. A lot of people (especially outside US) are very much aware about how toxic american companies have become. In Europe there is right now a whole sector growing rapidly that is doing \"X but European\" and it looks very promising. This is not only a Europe thing, the same is happening in Asia, but European laws and culture have accelerated it. What this means is that you will see a lot of destruction and downfall as these giant parasites have to die or kill their hosts. Don't be the host. Don't rely on them. Don't do business with them. Don't work for them. Avoid them like the plague, and don't stand in their way when they fall. They will cause collateral damage, regulators should have stepped in a long time ago, but greed prevented that. These companies are already leaving big billion dollar holes in the market. They can't win those markets back, because in business trust is everything and they have lost trust from these markets. As they continue falling, they need to continue sucking out more blood of their remaining hosts which will further erode trust and create new bigger markets looking for a non toxic alternative. Be that alternative. It has never been easier. The future is bright if you want to. Random info: \"money is the root of all evil\" is false. It is actually \"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\". If you dig into the original bible texts, it is clear that it is not talking about money as being evil. It is talking about a spirit (mentality) that in English would be more accurately translated as \"greed\". It is very clear that greed causes destruction and suffering on all levels. From companies managing to erode the middle class to Putin wanting more land. There are companies that steal (legal with greedy corrupt leaders) water only to sell it back to the local population. Why? Greed. It caused Boeing planes to fall from the sky, it caused the 2008 crash and it will cause the AI crash. No matter how much they eat, they remain hungry without limits. This is what greed does. Greed weaponizes good companies with good ideas and turn it into a money sucking machine with no limits. If you want to resist this, you have to start with yourself. Everything starts with one person. Be that person. reply",

Proponents might say “that’s the point - you don’t have to worry about there you are, it’s one code base” but these sort of issues indicate otherwise.

One comment stands out to me: > Whether to add it to the formal guidelines ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ) is a different question, of course. I'm reluctant to do that, partly because it arguably follows from what's there, partly because this is still a pretty fuzzy area that is rapidly evolving, and partly because the community is already handling this issue pretty well. I guess me raising this question is because it feels maybe slightly off that people can't really know about this unwritten rule until they break it or see someone else break it and people tell them why. It is true that the community seems to handle it with downvotes, but it might not be clear enough why something gets downvoted, people can't see the intent. And it also seems like an inefficient way of communicating community norms, by telling users about them once they've broken them. Being upfront with what rules and norms to follow, like the guidelines already do for most things, feels more honest and welcoming for others to join in on discussions. reply",

          "text": "The rules are written; they're just not all in that one document. The balance HN strikes here is something Dan has worked out over a very long time. There's at least two problems with arbitrarily fleshing out the guidelines (\"promoting\" \"case law\" to \"statutes\", as it were): * First, the guidelines get too large, and then nobody reads them all, which makes the guideline document less useful. Better to keep the guidelines page reduced down to a core of things, especially if those things can be extrapolated to most of the rest of the rules you care about (or most of them plus a bunch of stuff that doesn't come up often enough to need space on that page). * Second, whatever you write in the guidelines, people will incline to lawyer and bicker about. Writing a guideline implies, at least for some people, that every word is carefully considered and that there's something final about the specific word choices in the guidelines. \"Technically correct is the best kind of correct\" for a lot of nerds like us. Perhaps \"generated comments\" is trending towards a point where it earns a spot in the official guidelines. It sure comes up a lot. The flip side though is that we leave a lot of \"enforcement\" of the guidelines up to the community, and we have a pretty big problem with commenters randomly accusing people of LLM-authoring things, even when they're clearly (because spelling errors and whatnot) human-authored. Anyways: like I said, this is pretty well-settled process on HN. I used to spend a lot of time pushing Dan to add things to the guidelines; ultimately, I think the approach they've landed on is better than the one you (and, once, I) favored. reply",

I don't like that sort of phrase either, I especially hate comments that just go \"This.\", but they're rare on HN so I'm in good company. Ultimately, I put it because: - It was the most directly informative comment on the thread; - It had been downvoted (greyed out) to the very bottom of the thread; and - I wanted to express my support before making a fairly orthogonal comment without whiplashing everyone. The whiplashing concern is the problem I run into most generally. It can be hard to reply to someone with a somewhat related idea without making it seem like you're contradicting them, particularly if they're being dogpiled on with downvotes or comments. I'd love to hear other ways to go about this, I'm always trying to improve my communication. reply",

This is analogous to \"Should we ban people from wearing bluetooth headsets in the coffee shop?\" in the 00s: people are demonstrating a new behavior that is disrupting social norms but the actual violation is really that the person looks like a dork.

All questions are legitimate, but in this circumstance what reason is there to believe that they would find even more enjoyment from reducing the quality? It seems a lot like code. You can \"vibe code\" your way into an ungodly mess, but those who used to enjoy the craft of writing high quality code before LLMs arrived still seem to insist on high quality code even if an LLM is helping produce it now. It is highly likely that internet comments are no different. Those who value quality will continue to. Those who want garbage will produce it, AI or not. Much more likely is seeing the user base shift over time towards users that don't care about quality. Many a forum have seen that happen long before LLMs were a thing, and it is likely to happen to forums again in the future. But, the comments aren't written for you (except your own, of course) anyway, so... It is not rational to want to control what others are writing for themselves.

The epitome of writing for oneself. > upvotes were intended to be used for comments that contributed to the discussion. Intent is established by he who acts, not he who observes. It fundamentally cannot be any other way. The intent of an upvote is down to whatever he who pressed the button intended. That was case from conception of said feature, and will always remain the case. Attempting to project what you might have intended had you been the one who acted onto another party is illogical. > The contents of those comments should not be purely self-satisfying, though. Unless, perhaps, you are receiving a commission with detailed requirements, there is really no way to know what someone else will find satisfying. All you can do is write for yourself. If someone else also finds enjoyment in what you created, wonderful, but if not, who cares? That's their problem. And if you did receive a commission to write for another, well, you'd expect payment.

And then there's people (like eg. experienced wikipedians doing research) who have google-fu and can find accurate information about the weirdest things in the amount of time it takes you to tie your shoes and get your hat on. Now watch how someone like THAT uses chatgpt (or some better LLM) . It's very different from just prompting with a question. Often it involves delegating search tasks to the LLM (and opening 5 google tabs alongside besides) . And they get really interesting results! reply",

We know it's not perfect but it works. Without the embedded translation? It absolutely wouldn't.

          "text": "I find the premise reasonable, though I do have an observation. The current AI hype may have placed us in a filter bubble or echo chamber, shaping our conclusions. These highly specialized algorithms can nudge or reward us for thinking in specific ways. Regarding programming languages, there is immense value in understanding internal primitives. As example, consider concurrency primitives. Different languages provide different levels of abstraction: high-level library support in Python, the event loop structure in JavaScript, compiler-level implementations in Rust and C++, runtime-intrinsic mechanisms in Go and Java, and virtual machine intrinsics, such as Erlang. By viewing languages through this lens, you recognize that each implements these primitives differently, allowing you to choose the most effective tool for the job. If your goal is to assess the short-term economic value of a technology, your logic is understandable. However, learning new languages and tools remains worthwhile. When AI agents begin invoking these tools on the fly, you may not know if a specific choice is the most effective one. Without this knowledge, you will have some gaps to challenge the AI's decision. In the long run, making the effort to master these concepts yields far greater value as a software engineer. It enables you to understand the rationale behind applying a precise tool to a precise task. There are valid arguments supporting various perspectives on this. However, while any approach can be useful, this discussion highlights the need for wisdom: the awareness of one's own biases. As I noted earlier, filter bubbles can distort judgment. Continuously questioning your conclusions helps ensure you move toward the best outcomes. I hope you find this recommendation useful. reply",

          "text": "Agreed. There's no way someone can vibe code production-quality code today... Interestingly as AI models are becoming \"more competent\" I'm finding more and more issues with AI generated code in the project I work on... Whenever AI is used by a more junior dev (or a senior dev who simply can't be assed) you always find strange patterns which a senior would never have done... Typically the code works, but there might be subtle security issues or just unusual coding patterns where it appears an LLM has written slop, and instead of taking a step back and reconsidering its approach when errors crop up, LLMs tend to just add layers of complexity to patch over its slop. These problems obviously compound if left unchecked. I actually prefer how things were last year when coding models were less competent because at least if a problem was hard enough they'd get nowhere. Today they're good enough to keep hacking until the slop it writes is just about working. In regards to OPs question though, I suspect there's less point in playing around with different technologies to get some basic understanding of how they work today (LLMs can do this). But if you want to be able to guide LLMs towards good solutions and ensure the code being produced in the era of AI is good, then having engineers with a deep understanding of the technologies they're using is very important. reply",

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

Resume: https://mbrigdan.github.io/mbrigdan/resume.pdf Email: mbrigdan@gmail.com -- Hi folks, I'm Matt. About 7 years of experience working at the interface between data science and backend development. My most recent work has been around optimization of grid-scale energy storage systems - I was the technical lead for the team's first go-live in the ERCOT power market. A lot of experience taking something functional but bespoke (think e.g. a Jupyter notebook from a DS researcher) and applying rigorous software engineering principles to make it modular/scalable/maintainable, and dealing with the problems that result from applying machine learning in the real world (e.g. robustness to forecast error). Primarily experienced in Python but I've learned a lot of languages at this point and don't mind learning new tools that fit that job. Not afraid to get my hands dirty deep in the guts of algorithms/statistics/mathematics, my background is in electrical engineering with some signal processing experience. I've got years of math skills crying out to be used! I'm looking for a role that lets me sink my teeth into challenging problems - some kind of math/statistical analysis/optimization/algorithmic bent would be ideal, I get a great kick out of testing out cutting edge new libraries, implementing an algorithm from a new research paper, that kind of thing. Would love to connect, even if just for networking. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available by request Email: rtlo9962@gmail.com I'm a software engineer with a background in law and business (JD/MBA), now focused on hands-on engineering for cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, and AI-powered applications. I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

Various Javascript frameworks as they come and go: React, Svelte, Vue. DevOps with Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure. Résumé/CV: https://resume.sadauskas.com/ Email: psadauskas@gmail.com There’s an inflection point in every startup, where you’ve got your MVP and first customers, and now you need to scale everything. You need to make the application faster while also adding features and fixing bugs. You need to grow the whole team, not just engineering, and build the tools to support them. This is where I’m in my groove. I’ve grown teams from 3 to 100+, improved performance while scaling to 100x the load, and designed and built features from the ground up in an iterative and agile manner to minimize time-to-delivery while maximizing flexibility for future work. I have over 20 years of experience as a full-stack web application developer, primarily as a Rails developer since its inception. I also have experience with a large variety of languages, frameworks and technologies. I’m comfortable working at entire levels of the app stack, from CSS to SQL. I have the experience to know when to hack together a quick solution, or take the time to architect a foundation that will scale and provide a platform upon which the team can build stable features for years. If you’re an early stage startup that has found product/market fit, and needs someone to scale both your product and your team, then I’d be a great choice to help you out. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I got a Dell XPS for work a couple years ago on someone's recommendation... one of my worst-ever decisions. The touchpad sucks and routinely breaks requiring restarts, constantly having driver issues (and you have to deal with the capital-N Nightmare that is SupportAssist for drivers), graphics card is busted and makes the display driver crash once a month. Power states are completely broken. Laptop will randomly turn on when it's in my bag and rev up to ten thousand degrees. Laptop will randomly, when on full battery and closed, decide to hard-shutoff leading to a windows recovery boot. Decides to do BIOS updates when it's at 3% battery in the middle of the night, then when I wake up for work the next morning it has to go through a ten-minute recovery sequence. Battery is swelling after only a couple years of use, which sometimes causes keys on the keyboard to stop working. In the middle of a slack convo I've had to type \"Sorrymyspacebarstoppedworkinggottarestartmycomputer\". BSODs, hard drive corruption, you name it. Never buy Dell. Not that there's many good options out there unless you're willing to drop two week's pay on a Framework - but anything is better than Dell. EDIT: Another I thought of - sound card is busted and sounds like it has a low pass filter on it. I know it's not a speaker issue because on occasion it magically fixes itself until the next restart. reply",

If I had a way to transition from sleep to shut down I'd use it, but also... this is where I see that if the sleep state were more perfect (used zero energy, zero unintended wakeups), it would obviate my need to shut down most of the time. reply",

I was bothered by the failure but understand sometimes things just break. The service quality was good. I'm not dealing with the scale other people are in here.  We should take the ancedotes of personal laptops with a grain of salt.  Anyone pushing the scale that Dell does will have incidents where service runs totally off the rails.  I don't know how they stack up at scale but I'm reading this thread with interest.  When I'm due for a laptop upgrade Dell will still be in the running but right now Framework might be the one to get my business. reply",

          "text": "I recently got a new Thinkpad for work, can't recall which model. I think L series? The build quality is nicer than my T530. The bottom cover doesn't have access panels anymore, but it's got just a few captive(!!) screws and the whole bottom comes off. Everything is neatly exposed and you don't need to access the top of the board at all. The bottom cover has plastic clips along with the screws, but they're spring loaded! They aren't simply molded in and cannot snap off. It's some incredible attention to detail. I've noticed that most recent laptops have the vent behind the screen hinge where it's completely blocked if the screen is closed. Thinkpad has the vent fully exposed. In fact, it exposes more vent when the screen is closed. Too bad the CPU is a lemon. One of the new AMD chips with a built in NPU. The NPU is slower than the integrated graphics for inference. Not a discrete card, just the GPU baked into the chip. In contrast, I got a hand-me-down Dell XPS-something from 2020 when I first started this job. It idles IDLES! at 100°C. I tried to re-paste the CPU, but the heat pipes were so small and thin that I crushed one between my fingers. Even with massive airflow through the case from external fans, it never drops below 100C. Absolutely inexcusable. Looks to me like Lenovo still has it. At least if you're paying real money for a professional level machine. This new Thinkpad is now my #1 most repairable and maintainable machine. T530 is a close second. Absolutely every other laptop I've ever used is tied for last place in the garbage. reply",

But, sadly, next generations went deep shit instead. Nowadays, I have a very hard time selecting a laptop that would fit my needs, even disregarding the price.\nOne of the worst feature in term of offender is the keyboard: Manufacturers are going on with this totally stupid unergonomic trend of having \"half size\" enter keys, removing page-up/page-down keys, and hiding directional arrows behind over keys needing to use the \"FN+other_key\" to be able to use the arrow. reply",

By cheap I mean 300 or 400 Euro and by expensive I mean 800 or 1000 Euro or more. Some laptops that flex are made of metal, some that do not flex are made of plastic. My HP ZBook 15 from 2014 is rock solid and does not flex even if it's mostly plastic. There is a catch: the keyboard is built with a sheet of metal on the bottom, so it's very rigid. The laptop itself has a frame of metal and a shell of plastic. It's definitely not light, one of those laptops in the 3 kg category (6 lbs?) and definitely not cheap. It's also built for total repairability: it opens with no screws and I can replace everything even the CPU and the GPU l. I replaced the HDD and the DVD with 2 SSDs, maxed out the RAM to 32 GB and replaced the keyboard many times, when keys eventually wear and start to fail. I'd buy it again, with modern components (NVME bus, DDR5 RAM) and without the number pad so I can center the space bar and the touchpad. reply",

          "text": "I've had about 400 Windows HP laptops/200 desktops through my hands running IT for a nonprofit. They are not perfect, but the different models (from cheapo plastic-case 12/13 inch to top-of-the-line metal cased \"16 inch desktop replacements\" lappies and low to mid-level desktops) have been better built, and more easily serviced, than comparable Lenovo, Dell & Acer models I've had my hands on in the same time. Our new MSP pushed Lenovos on us for a batch of 25 or so computers including my latest laptop, and I regret it. They just didn't have a 15\" metal case in the price range so I got a plastic 16\". Overall performance is lower than comparably spec'd HP Z-Book Fireflys I was using, when this Thinkpad T16 G4 hits the upper limits of RAM, it feels like it's using swap on a slow platter drive. Even on lower-spec HP Pro & EliteBooks, they slow down at max RAM but don't just freeze. Our staff thrashes the shit out of gear, so finding decently-priced lower-spec metal-bodied laptops is essential. Even on latest HP laptops I am able to replace RAM, batteries, SSDs without dealing with epoxied sockets. Haven't had to often, but displays and keyboards could be swapped if absolutely needed last time we had to several years ago. That said, the performance of onboard HP Bluetooth sucks compared to others I've used and their stock bloatware is terrible. Specific to Lenovo, when I was shopping for a bunch of laptops about 3 years ago there were weird gotchas like \"I can get every spec I need EXCEPT backlit keyboard, which kicks me up to the next model, at least $300 more/unit\" and \"Gee, they solder in a low amount of RAM on this one to make you...yup, spend at least $300 more/unit\"... reply",

Sometime, it will be too long a time to wake up from sleep or a random crash which requires me to fetch bitlocker key from my account so that I can boot it up again to driver update issues to the fan continuously running for no reason etc. I had, by chance, a good experience with Acer in the past and since then have purchased a couple fo them more and the experience has been seamless and pleasant.

Everything USB should still take normal 5 volts, which any charger should provide without needing negotiation, and anything larger that actually needs more juice also should have the appropriate electronics to handle that (i.e. it's a phone or a laptop or a tablet or similarly expensive device). If you have devices that don't fall into either of those categories, so they don't take normal 5 volts, or they need more juice but are picky about USB, I'd consider them faulty from the get-go, as it's clear they haven't actually implemented USB-PD in any meaningful way. And if your charger doesn't provide 5 volts without asking, it too is faulty. It's hard to go wrong with charging cables when it comes to USB-C. I agree there's a mess on the data side, but the USB Forum can't even get its head straight with what it should even be called, so it's no wonder nobody there has the balls to mandate colour coding or something similarly helpful. reply",

I had to replace the battery after 4 years but that wasn’t an issue. It did everything a daily driver is supposed to do, reliable and never threw a fit. I only had to change it as I felt I needed a better screen and performance. The Intel processor was showing its age. I have only minor complaints running Thinkpad with Ubuntu.

          "text": "I got my first Dell laptop, the XPS15, 5 years ago.  Prior to that I had a good 25 years as a Thinkpad die-hard.  The XPS has been ... ok.  I've had some issues with it resetting for no apparent reason over its life.  Frequency varies, but sometimes it'll just blank the screens and then the BIOS comes up on the display, a few times a week, then it'll be good for a month or more. I had one issue where I needed to ship it back: it would reset and then it was running off the battery, and no matter what port I plugged a charger/docking station into it wouldn't charge until I powered it off and back on again.  I got them to do a replacement under warranty a couple years ago. Around a month ago it was doing the reset fairly frequently and then wouldn't power on sometimes, and I noticed the wrist rest was a little bowed.  I replaced the battery pack (kind  of a pain, but not the worst I've done), and it was good for around a month, but now it has that \"won't charge the battery\" issue again.  I believe when they did the previous repair they replaced the motherboard, but now I'm out of warranty. For my next laptop I kind of want a Framework, so I can replace the mobo if I need to.  My work likes us to replace hardware no more frequently than every 5-6 years, but we get a warranty for way less than that (my laptop I pushed to get a 4 year). Meanwhile my previous Thinkpad T470s is still going strong, though the screen just developed a line through it.  That's ~10 year old now. My personal 4 year old Macbook has been a real workhorse, never had any hardware issues with it.  My son's macbook has been another story, he's had that in for service 4-5 times in the 3 years he's had it.  But, I suspect that is more him than the hardware.  I don't baby my MBP, but he is just terrible with things.  He's lucky if a pair of glasses can last 6 months, ditto with a phone (usually broken screens), so I'm not sure I can blame the MB Air... reply",

Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more. This is an opportunity for senior engineers and product managers to join us, and contribute to shaping a deep-tech product from its earliest stage.

I do some consulting to bootstrap the company with and build customer relations. Simultaenously, we're starting to build a product business. For that we have strengthened the team with a Senior ML Engineer (ex google) and a Head of Data with prior experience in setting up data pipelines in this domain. The products we build are in a broad sense trading signals, e.g. to help traders of renewable or flexible assets trade their positions better. Role: So given that it is pretty early days, we're of course looking for a broader skillset to lead the development especially of the cloud and backend infrastructure (hetzner), but eventually also frontend applications. Techstack so far is obviously minimal (linux, python, bash, postgres/timescale), so there is plenty of room to also shape this. What we as a team value is simplicity, really clean code/architectures, excellent documentations and quality over speed. So we're not trying to glue together the next venture to scam a bunch of VCs, but to really build something excellent. if that resonates with you, please reach out to me directly via the email address you'll find  on our website. reply",

You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes, deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when sites change. The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you will build need to be performant and maintainable. You should have solid Python skills and experience scraping ecommerce websites and APIs. You should also like the slightly-obsessive investigative nature of the work. If you worked in scraping or botting in the past, please hit me up! Reach out directly - gray at netail.ai reply",

Our work consists of a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts. Our principles are here: https://futo.org/about/what-is-futo/ Machine Learning Engineer - FUTO Keyboard FUTO Keyboard is a privacy-first software keyboard for Android. Every prediction inference routine runs entirely on-device; no user data can ever leave the device. We support over 150 keyboard layouts and languages, and over 700 layout + language combinations (not all of them include dictionary or predictions) Swipe typing is an important part of the mobile typing experience for many. Applying machine learning here poses a unique challenge due to the requirement of needing to support so many layouts and languages, as well as user-added personal dictionary words (or even layout customizations!), with limited data. We have previously collected and publicly released a US English QWERTY dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/ We are looking for a machine-learning researcher or engineer to work through these challenges and help us improve the swipe typing experience in FUTO Keyboard.

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you've ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let's talk: info@fusionbox.com. reply",

I’m optimizing for someone autonomous who can run with outreach + content. Comp: contract, €60–€120/hour depending on fit, 8–16h/week. Start with a small paid test project.

Ideally they're a pragmatic backend expert to help us scale our integration platform as we continue to grow. The expectation is deep knowledge of healthcare standards. Integrations can be a full time role, but at a startup it's necessary to wear many hats. So this individual should also feel comfortable as a generalist who can jump in at any part of the stack. Stack: Python, Django, GraphQL, AWS, TypeScript, React, Terragrunt/OpenTofu Ideal: early-stage experience, deep experience in healthcare integrations (FHIR, HL7, etc.), thrives solving problems Fair compensation + equity JD and application: https://app.dover.com/apply/altirahealth/862317ca-7c42-4dc1-... reply",

We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026. As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO).  Now that we have thousands of customers, I have many other responsibilities and need to bring on a fulltime engineer (you!) to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  Together, you and I will add obfuscation, improve our interpreter, possibly re-write method dispatch, etc.  You don’t need to be a compiler/runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code. If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other large open source project, are compiler/runtime curious, and want to work at a growing startup, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding.

          "text": "The biggest thing to be aware of honestly is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Essentially, .NET Core has dropped the \"Core\" moniker. It's just .NET (I tend to refer to it as .NET proper when differentiating between Framework). This change began with .NET 5.0. If you're starting from scratch, you will want to build everything using .NET now. Do not use .NET Framework unless absolutely necessary. Probably the most common reason you'd be stuck using .NET Framework is because your project is reliant on some driver or library that isn't making the transition to .NET proper. If you're in this situation, you should try to move as much stuff as you can to be on .NET proper and then use .NET Standard , a middle man library Microsoft developed for this exact situation, to allow for cohesion between .NET Framework and .NET proper. Otherwise, in terms of specific \"modern\" coding practices? I'd say to pay attention to modern OOP approaches in general. Dependency Injection seems to be used everywhere now. Also, be careful using Reflection. People get a lot done with it really fast, but if it starts being used for more than just attribute inspection and you're doing some crazy shit with it, that's usually a sign of a bigger architectural issue. Lastly, review LINQ if it's been a while for you. Specifically, understand deferred execution as a lot of people shoot themselves in the foot by tacking on a `.ToList()` and enumerating over a massive collection they shouldn't be enumerating over. C# has changed a lot, but it's more subtle than the way a lot of other languages have progressed. Mostly just new features that you can survive very easily without. C# 14 is bringing some interesting changes though, but that's still pretty new, so I'd see the release notes on that if you're interested. reply",

          "text": "I been using C# since .Net Framework 4.6, jumped to .Net 6, and have kept up to .Net 9 when starting new projects. My advice is to download .Net 9 SDK because it's now super easy to create a file with extension .cs, put your terminal window next to your code, and call `dotnet run file.cs` and it just works. The compiler will teach you a lot because the errors are extremely easy to follow. I never bought into books because too many language features have been added in the past years that improve on \"old\" ways. The only complaint I have is that Google is still the best interface for navigating the docs. Spamming google over and over. Solving this in an easily greppable way is on my wishlist. Especially because I see the MSDN docs are rolling out new \"Did you want to generate a sample of this?

That art/originality is fading, that technology is causing more harm than good, and that most jobs now exist to feed some mindless machine where sole goal is to get people addicted. Tech roles feel drained of purpose, and non-tech roles are being eaten away.<p>This outlook is a stark contrast to the era I grew up in. From 2010 to 2020, tech optimism was at its peak. Despite the flaws, companies like Airbnb, Uber, Amazon, and countless SaaS startups felt like they were genuinely improving things—breaking old monopolies and building better systems.<p>Now we have AI, arguably the most transformative technology of our lifetime, yet a lot of times the reaction seems to be exhaustion rather than excitement. Sure, people love using it, but unlike the early Internet, AI doesn't seem like a medium for creativity. The core value feels just about compressing the time it takes to do what we were already doing.<p>Maybe it’s age. Maybe it’s just me. And maybe I am bitten by false nostalgia. But I’m curious: how are others seeing this shift?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I like to read about the Industrial Revolution a lot, and I think a thing that’s lost in the the way we talk about luddites was the change from guild/skilled labor to factory labor.  Software engineering is a lot like that old guild labor, you understand the whole of your craft (at the time called “mysteries”) and work to build things understanding that entirety. When things changed to factory / assembly lines, sure,  products got a lot cheaper and more plentiful for everyone else, but if you were a blacksmith or stone mason or etc.  you lost both your middle class income, status in society, and day to day joy from being an expert with autonomy — we talk a lot about how engineers value autonomy when building engineering cultures. With AI that’s starting to slip away. I actually think the twentieth century is a global culture-tech inflection point, and while I’m reluctant to say things will just continue to get worse (there are a lot of years ahead of us and lots of eras and changes to go through). The one thing I’m sure of is that for all the benefits technological change brings they’re not evenly distributed. So as many I think have pointed out, if you like spending 8+ hours a day on the nuts and bolts of software engineering, and you’re really invested in the sort of late nineties to early 2020’s technological paradigm, subjectively —- things are probably getting worse from here on out. reply",

          "text": "I see it.  I think that a couple of large things happened in the larger society, and tech is inside of that. The American Dream kind of died.  It died in two ways, and it's important to keep them separate. First, the American Dream died (or at least got very sick) in that the path from high school graduate to high-paying job got very narrow.  This was because other countries rebuilt after WWII, and outsourcing happened, and the US culture changed from more \"we're all in this together\" to more \"I got mine, you can starve\". Second, the American Dream died even for those who got the well-paid jobs.  They found out that it wasn't enough - that they needed something more than more money.  Material prosperity is not enough, and more material prosperity won't fix it.  Humans need something more, and we aren't getting it. We're not getting it from technology, either.  We don't need better graphics and instant movies.  We don't even need social media - or at least, we don't need what social media has turned into, making us a slave to dopamine hits. With that going on, how do people view tech?  As a way to get rich?  Well, that's probably not going to work out, at least not for most of us, and even if it does, all it gets me is money.  As a means of making the world better?  Yeah, how's that working out? We're feeling the lack of something, and money isn't going to fix it, and tech isn't either. I think that's what changed.  People thought that tech could make the world better, and make them rich along the way, and now they see that tech can't fix what we need fixed, and being rich isn't enough. reply",

After the big wars, there was abundant energy, relative geopolitical stability, so everything was improving for everybody (we can use more energy to build more machine to produce more stuff that becomes cheaper so we own more and we are happier). Now we see that we have: 1. An energy problem (we're reaching the peak of fossil fuels, that shows in the economy, and we don't have a viable solution for saving the growth). 2. A climate problem, which means that even if we discovered an infinite source of fossil fuels that could save the growth, we would still be screwed because climate change will eventually destroy society as we know it (and probably kill many (most?) of us). 3. A biodiversity problem, which means that even if we discovered an infinite, clean energy and somehow saved the climate, the very consequence of our growth is habitat loss. We're living in a mass extinction that's orders of magnitudes faster than the one that killed the dinosaurs. It's a fact, it's measured. Say we could have a fusion reactor in our smartphones, we could still not eat it. It used to be that everything was going well, and therefore technology was just allowing us to own more and be happier. Now we realise that all of this is not sustainable. And technology is what allowed us to get where we are, and it doesn't look at all like it can save us. The sustainable way is \"doing less with less\". reply",

          "text": "A lot of art from the middle ages is anonymous. Painting itself is an extension of the artist, containing the intension of the person producing it and hence no name is necessary. This is a theoretical state of quality, where activity is not measured in numbers or on a scale but is seen as expression of a particular unique human being. Then comes the renaissance and painters begin to attach names to their works. Here starts a crucial shift - a turn from quality to quantity. Certain artists are better than others and hence quality itself is now measured (quantified) using a name of the person. After that the name becomes so prevalent that some works begin to be valuable only because a certain name was responsible in producing that work. Think - Picasso. Quantity starts to take over. Then comes film and comics and ads where the painter is expected to have no  individuality, and he is praised for having a style and technique that is replaceable. Same is true for corporate software development by the way. Here the name (the intermediate state connecting quality and quantity) starts to disappear and is often replaced by a name of a \"golem\" - a corporation. Quantity dominates - more and faster is better, and the more \"nameless\" the better. Ten years ago one might think that this is the limit of dehumanisation and it cannot move any further. But now we have AI - where a work of art (or other kind of work) cannot be associated with any quality (cannot be given a name) in principle. And quantity (more, faster, cheaper) dominates. When you think in these terms, the \"techno-optimism\" is just a place somewhere in this arrow moving from quality to quantity. Or in other words moving from a qualitative anonymity (my work is an extension of my being) to quantitative anonymity (the work is not associated with any being). Hence, it is not a stable position. reply",

It's a retail and logistics company that understood the impact and possibilities of the internet. AirBnb (founded 2008) understood and exploited that the internet and smartphone allowed a new approach to holiday lettings but isn't doing anything hard technologically. Uber (founded 2009) has done the same for taxi cabs. Nothing technologically hard but making full use of the ubiquitous smartphone. Perhaps you remember the 2010s as more exciting because it was when the smartphone was new so there was this burst of apps and services to make use of it. reply",

          "text": "I'd say it is saturation fatigue. 20 years ago, people who were online were kinda power users. Nowadays, internet is full of normies. Nothing wrong with that but it also means competition for everything has increased ten fold. Social networks used to be filled with smart people, now they are filled with average people and smart people are now just static noise in the background. Jobs in IT are the same. Instead of 5 smart people competing for one job, now you might have hundreds and thousands and as employer you might not be able to distinguish the good/skilled one from the average one. And now employers have to hire based on your skin color instead of skill, among other things, which dilutes the potential for a company to be successful in inventing, creating, competing disrupting... You used to be able to create some fun side project and get few customers to pay your bills. Nowadays, everything is monopolised and behind red tape with insane cost of entry. Which discourages competition and creativity of an individual. Software has hit a plateau with social networks, online communication, programming languages and whatnot. Now it is all about AI(which it is not but it is being sold as such) because that is the last software paramount. Hardware stopped advancing too, mostly due to AI again. We had the smart phone revolution, tablet revolution, online video streaming revolution... then Elon Musk did some work with SapaceX(rockets + internet) and electric cars. But that is about it. Not much new came after that. Definitely nothing ground breaking or revolutionary. Again, likely because most effort and investments go into AI hardware. So we are in a limbo when it comes to both - HW and SW. We've reached peak saturation in user base, we've hit ceiling in programming and hardware and there is nothing interesting behind the corner. Maybe except new-age nuclear reactors(smaller, more efficient) and quantum computing(though that is still decades away from commercial use and production). But I think all of this is mostly because economic and demographic factors. The societies have peaked, at least the \"western\" ones, and are now heading into correction period that will stifle technological progress as the \"west\" overplayed the globalization card and has to pull back and start shifting towards manufacturing and blue collar jobs, as it became heavily service-based economically. Also it is important to factor in the feminism and DEI aspect of modern societies that is causing (white)men to graduate less, partake in STEM less, be more absent in white collar jobs, HR departments hindering creativity at the work place and so on. It's a whole bowl of spaghetti of societal issues that has to get unwound and levelled before we can bounce back up. reply",

Yet it's plan isn't 'be a less shitty company to work for'. If you did home automation stuff, how much of that is still around, working, and useful? I have a really complex system to turn my front light on at dusk using the internet, something a light sensor did at my parents house in the 90s. And that's about all I have left working. When you stop your car at a stoplight, and instead of having buttons you have a big screen with an ad, that is also selling all of your movement info, are you experiencing progress? Netflix, Amazon, etc use to have algorithms that made what you wanted rise to the top. They now all make what Netflix/Amazon/etc want rise to the top. Every tech company's main focus is 'how shitty can I get away with if shitty gets me more money'? Instead of giving me relevant, they now either sell add positions (Amazon) or chose position based on how profitable it is to them (Netflix/Spotify financial/licensing considerations come above an algo taylored for me like they used to have). We literally have seperate recipes from American companies now. Slop for the domestic American market, and the 1990s actual food grade recipes for Europe. For our grains now, instead of traditional harvesting, we spray Roundup/glyphosate (tested and approved for earlier in the crop cycle) to kill the wheat/etc to better control harvest. We literally added as a final step for our food to pour questionable glyphosate/herbicides on it all. America now has more private equity than McDonalds, build on a business model that would have made Reagan era cocaine filled corporate raiders blush. What once made for scandals for movies is now more common than McDonalds. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/private-equity-consolidation... reply",

Uber/ifood and other transport/delivery apps are just working around labor laws, undoing centuries of progress towards worker rights and approaching slavery-like situations. Amazon is just another monopoly, not sure why you put it beside the others, but it's one of the companies lobbying to make the world a worse place. Then came crypto\"currency\", which started the \"age of anything goes\", where tons of money are thrown in the trashbin for the next speculative pseudo-tech bubble. AI is just the bubble that came after crypto, little practical utility with lots of hype from billionaires who threw money at it. After it bursts, there'll probably be another. reply",

          "text": "I think the future is both bright and dark. It has never been this easy to create anything yourself. Anything from software to hardware, you can buy and build the tools and make something amazing in your spare time that would only 20 years ago would take a small team with some funding. There are 2 kinds of companies:\n1. The greedy kind that always want more. They see extracting money out of their customers as their sole purpose.\n2. The kind that want to build good stuff and help people. A lot of companies start out as nr 2, but with time and growth, greedy people have a tendency to climb the ladder and turn the nr 2 companies into nr 1 unless the original team knows about this and resist such change. This also means that the founders must be okay living their whole life without owning a Bugatti. VC companies make it hard to stay as nr 2, because even if you are good, if you make a deal with a VC firm that wants to 100x their investment through you, then you have already let the greedy devil through the front door. A nr 1 company will over time turn into a parasite. Once they extract more value than they give, it is a downward spiral of destruction on the way down. A big part of the US tech economy (as seen from Europe) have \"evolved\" into parasites. They say they fuel the economy. What they actually mean is that they cause a lot of money to flow around. A parasite that suck a lot of blood will also make a lot of blood flow, so it is not a good measurement of health. The good news are that parasites die eventually. A lot of people (especially outside US) are very much aware about how toxic american companies have become. In Europe there is right now a whole sector growing rapidly that is doing \"X but European\" and it looks very promising. This is not only a Europe thing, the same is happening in Asia, but European laws and culture have accelerated it. What this means is that you will see a lot of destruction and downfall as these giant parasites have to die or kill their hosts. Don't be the host. Don't rely on them. Don't do business with them. Don't work for them. Avoid them like the plague, and don't stand in their way when they fall. They will cause collateral damage, regulators should have stepped in a long time ago, but greed prevented that. These companies are already leaving big billion dollar holes in the market. They can't win those markets back, because in business trust is everything and they have lost trust from these markets. As they continue falling, they need to continue sucking out more blood of their remaining hosts which will further erode trust and create new bigger markets looking for a non toxic alternative. Be that alternative. It has never been easier. The future is bright if you want to. Random info: \"money is the root of all evil\" is false. It is actually \"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\". If you dig into the original bible texts, it is clear that it is not talking about money as being evil. It is talking about a spirit (mentality) that in English would be more accurately translated as \"greed\". It is very clear that greed causes destruction and suffering on all levels. From companies managing to erode the middle class to Putin wanting more land. There are companies that steal (legal with greedy corrupt leaders) water only to sell it back to the local population. Why? Greed. It caused Boeing planes to fall from the sky, it caused the 2008 crash and it will cause the AI crash. No matter how much they eat, they remain hungry without limits. This is what greed does. Greed weaponizes good companies with good ideas and turn it into a money sucking machine with no limits. If you want to resist this, you have to start with yourself. Everything starts with one person. Be that person. reply",
