          "text": "i think, its more then convenient to click on a link and being logged in. No account creation, no risk of leaking hashes/pwds/info. I don't have to remember what password is used where (minimizing the risk of one big password for all sites), no monolithic mammoth-authentication-systems with a single/multiple point-of-failures, no auth-gate-keepers. The problems with passwords you mention, are valid. But, the same situation will happen for authentication - your mom can't remember her email account's pwd, but then you want her to remember facebook, google and all the other services' pwds?? Just think about where is the difference of \"remember email pwd\" and \"remember 1Password pwd\" ?? absolutely no difference. So, while I understand your points, I'm thinking, magic links are the easiest and failure proof and user friendly way, to verify the user. Another point is: Onboarding is very fast. The new user doesn't even need to bother with input of pwds, verfication, etc ... for me: please no account creation in the old style. Give me magic links. Implement a 2nd factor to check, if necessary - but just let them passwords dieeeeee reply",

If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it. Some possible ideas: Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity. Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense. Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc). Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad. You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough reply",

Unless you have business connections and raised funding from people who do, open source wil not help gain any additional adoption or raise awareness of your project. This only worked in the past. 2. Hardly anybody who does happen to use your open source project will pay you. You need massive global exposure just to make a developers' standard salary... I remember for years Evan You who built VueJS was getting like $120k max in sponsorships annually (I think it was Patreon), at the peak... And VueJS was extremely popular at the time and being updated frequently... And companies got something (e.g. exposure) in exchange for the sponsorship. 3. It doesn't matter how good it is. Implementation details don't really matter. If your product is useful, some big tech company will build an inferior alternative but promote it like crazy. Nobody will even know your project exists. It doesn't matter if your product is better for many use cases; people won't know it exists so that fact is irrelevant. 4. At best, some big tech monopoly will use your open source code to train their AI to replace you in the marketplace or drive down your wages. People like Linus, DHH, Matt Mullenweg, Solomon Hykes... Who made millions; are from a different epoch and different place too. Not happening anymore. Don't be fooled. They all had to move to Silicon Valley at some point. It's a big club and you ain't in it. My advice is; if you can't sell it, keep your code and use for yourself and your friends/family. reply",

Okay...so it isn't \"sustainable\". So you stop maintaining it. So what? You made a neat thing. You had fun making it. You shared it with others because you thought it was neat, and maybe someone else found it useful too. That's the happy ending of a happy story.

I'd say about 25% of my time is the fun part of writing the code (that just works for me.) The rest is in debugging the code for all the edge cases, writing docs, examples, training, support etc. In other words the \"work\" part. Minimally you need to do enough so that someone can use the code. The code itself has minimal value, the value is in the using. Then you need to figure out how to reach an audience. Then you need to decide if the user will pay, or maybe it's ad supported. Or maybe donations. Hint: unless you have a large audience this will result in very minimal income. Is all this extra work worth it? You can Open Source it, but frankly its unlikely anyone will find it or use it. It might be an interesting line on your CV, bit again probably of marginal value there. My advice is that if it has little to no value to others, just move on. reply",

However, FOSS, as applied to apps, games & tools is nothing more than tech slavery, which is why nowadays it's championed by FANNG and the Deep State (some countries like Israel and India commercialize FOSS source codes as a matter of statecraft).

For example I have worked in two companies that both chose to write sort of YAML based ingestion framework so that users only need to write YAML. I guess you can make the case that a general framework is useful, but TBH I think either it takes too long to include all use cases (and each company probably only needs one), or becomes too complicated to be a framework. Not to discourage you though, it's fun to build your own project and I'd love you to try it out. Worst case, no one uses it but you bag a ton of experience. reply",

The “source” can be modeled as a table. The “sink” can also be modeled as a table. What does a custom dsl provide over sql? I have a side project called Sqlflow which is attempting to do something similar/ https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow It’s not a DSL but the pipeline is standardized using the source, process, sink stages.\nRight now the process is pure sql but the source and sink are declarative.

Instead of challenging the underlying paradigm, we’re accelerating its replication — just with fewer keystrokes. GenAI is helping us pave cow paths, not design highways.

This can certainly be made more concise if desired, if we want to wrap things in classes, decorators, context managers, overload the actual pipe operator, or other syntactic sugar mechanisms. Most tools you find will be aimed at handling scale, and in the name of efficiency will therefore be in a columnar form, which is why you see a bunch of tools that do this already but only on tabular data. JSON is slow to work with beyond the initial load, so often you’d see it loaded into pandas or polars, maybe with minor transformation, then dumped to parquet files for some downstream tool to pick up and process. These systems are also geared toward being robust. In a real world system there are all kinds of unexpected errors to handle. What happens if the API you’re pushing to is down, or starts rate limiting you, or someone added a new field or renamed a field or your two data sets don’t have matching keys? Real pipelines have to account for this, and depending on your scenario you might want to retry, or roll back changes, and this can get ridiculously complicated because in API land you often don’t have any analogous concept of transactions and rollback like exist in SQL, so without a distributed transaction coordinator (it’s own complexity), streaming data will lead to distributed systems drifting out of sync. And now you need a batch job on top of your streaming data to ensure it hasn’t fallen out of sync (so in reality, unless you have heavy complexity needs, just use SQL so you have transactions, or just use batch jobs). But that’s the reason you don’t see this record-based fire-and-forget approach, because it’s too slow and lacks error handling, and why instead everything is columnar and heavyweight (with DAGs and workflow orchestrators etc). Maybe I’m missing your point, but your Python code could definitely be as concise as any of the other examples you gave. reply",

Then certain rerenders and calls can be clientside and others can go through the server if needed. It shouldn't just be a fashion choice, but a measured analysis. Like what is on your backend and what is on the edge, how would consistency work, what are the regional considerations, etc. I feel like asking which infra to build without knowing the app is putting the cart before the horse.

          "text": "I'll share what worked for me. I did a masters thesis on computational fluid dynamics. Go to google scholar and find the 'seminal' works in your field, for example say you want to know about aerodynamics, basically every course starts with Anderson's textbook, it has almost 10k citations. Find the books and papers with tonnes of citations. Those are likely the top books and top people in the field. Also look for literature reviews and if you search for universities and do 'filetype:pdf' in google, you can find lecture notes and reading lists. Those are all good starting points. As soon as you know what your topic is, start making it a habit to read research papers, take notes in the margins, highlight stuff. Read papers every week. I was lucky to have a long train ride where I had no phone service for a solid 60mins per day, so I read papers on the train almost every day. At this point you should know who the key people are and what they are interested in, in your field and topic. For my topic I figured out there are like 20 key researchers in the field, find the ones who are regularly publishing still (last 10 years or so) and read all of their stuff. You should be forming the 'lay of the land' now and finding patterns in where the gaps are, what future work and next steps are the researchers writing about. Work with your supervisor to discuss what you learned and narrow down the topic. So that is the INPUT part of the process covered. Let's talk about the OUTPUT next. When I was putting my thesis together, I really didn't want to have to write it all at the end or in the last few months. So my method was to imagine each chapter or so, was a paper of it's own, that built on each other. As you read you should be putting your literature review together anyway which could be a whole chapter of a thesis. Then the other pieces - introduction,  proofs, calculations, experimental design, testing, results, conclusion. If you start writing bits of it as soon as you get your topic you'll have lots of writing done by the time it comes to publishing, and the challenge is more about editing it down and making it cohesive. Obviously you kind of do the work then write the results, and from there form your intro and abstract to review what you did, and the conclusions to discuss next steps and how to build on your research. This approach scales from a single paper to a book, and it's mostly about being curious of the current state of the art in your field, building a habit for reading other papers, and figuring out where the gaps could be. As an undergrad, you're not really expected to contribute new science, so it's fine to pick an existing method and paper and only change a little bit of it, your supervisor will have a better idea of where the bar is set on this point, and what you're expected to accomplish. reply",

          "text": "While I do like LLMs for these tasks, unfortunately this one failed you but was a near enough miss that you couldn't see it. What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

To be clear, I'm using it to become a better small game developer and not relying on it to answer anything I would classify as an \"important question\". Moreover, I don't take everything AI tells me to be 100% accurate (and I never copy/paste the response). Rather, I use it as an assistant with which I can have a back and forth \"conversation\" to acquire other perspectives. Despite a lot of effort, I'm just not a highly skilled developer and I don't have any friends / colleagues I can turn to for assistance (I don't know a single software developer or even another person who enjoys video games). While resources like StackOverflow are certainly useful, having answers tailored to my specific situation really accelerates progress. I'm not trying to cure cancer here and much of what would be considered the \"best approach\" for a small game architecture is unique to the developer. As such, AI is an incredible resource to lean on and get information tailored to my unique use case (here is my code...how does {topic} apply to my situation?\") And yes, I find errors from time to time, but that is good. It keeps me on my toes and forces me to really understand the response / perspective. reply",

You could extract the initial matrix of embeddings from some open-weights model and find tokens closest to your query. However, it's not clear why do this. OP got coherent text, so that's not search. It's _similar_, though, because attention in LLMs basically looks for most similar tokens. So to answer the question about the term, the LLM had to create a stream of tokens that's semantically closest to the given description.

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have seen a few examples of this. Every case is a little different, but from what you've described I'd focus on salvaging the co-founder relationship. Conflict like this is totally normal. IMO, a pivot is when you change directions based on new information. It sounds like you're not pivoting, but lost. If you haven't already, addressing this head-on and having a candid conversation about being lost would be beneficial. Think of it as an exercise to possibly strengthen your relationship via conflict. Few other thoughts: 1. At this early stage of the business, the core asset is really the co-founding team and their relationship. Conflict is very much normal, but how you resolve it is important. You should be able to articulate your co-founder's concerns. For ex. she might feel the pressure to show \"progress\" to your investors. 2. It takes a lot of time and energy to build a good working relationship. Moving onto something else might seem like a good idea at the moment, but you could be right back with the same issue with another co-founder. 3. If you do decide to move on, end the relationship as amicably as you can. Note that this is not necessarily the \"quickest\" route, but it'll help keep your reputation intact. Edit: spelling. reply",

It's also possible that over the next two years, either he or his coworker could damage their relationships with investors. Typically, messy blow-ups reflect far worse on founders than politely stepping away. It often goes better to simply say something like, \"Hey, I'm sorry, but I don't think we're aligned anymore. This startup probably works best with just one captain at the helm, so for that reason, I'm out.\" Most importantly, even if sticking around for another year or two meant the difference between guaranteed funding and none at all, I'd still choose the extra year or two over the funding. Founders usually earn half—or even a third—of what they would make elsewhere. That extra time essentially translates to a couple of years of self-funded startup runway, and I'd much rather have that flexibility than guaranteed funding with strings attached. reply",

          "text": "Some additional personal observations that OP might find useful: - Building a company is really emotional, as you already know. Most founders are under-skilled when they start, and are forced to learn quickly. As a result, you get a lot of scars along the way and the experience will test all of your insecurities. Learning how to resolve existential crises again and again is part of the package. And it gets worse. Wait until you have whole teams of smart opinionated people that you have to lead. - It'll be good to revisit why you and your co-founder decided to start a company. You've both spent 2 years of your lives living in the trenches, so to speak. Someone decided you two were worth the risk. Why didn't your co-founder quit after the first idea failed? Why does she keep trying? I obviously don't have enough info to make any judgement calls, but I've seen situations where people make the wrong call because they've failed to truly appreciate the emotional baggage. For example, sometimes the first failure hits really hard and triggers all sorts of insecurities in a co-founder about not being good enough. And if their team starts questioning their judgement over and over without diffusing the insecurities, it just makes things worse. - There are good and bad breakups. Good breakups are worth it for the emotional closure and the reputational upside. Bad breakups can create all sorts of fallout that will affect you in unexpected way (sometimes without you even knowing, ex. if the drama resurfaces during due-diligence). All the legal mechanics are also much smoother and drama-free when the breakup is on good terms. - I am probably biased because these types of co-founder blowups are what keep investors up at night. Losing a technical co-founder is not only emotionally draining, but usually lethal for the investment. People problems are gnarly and take a lot of skill and precision to diffuse. If anything, use the crisis as a personal challenge to figure out how to resolve it on good terms. reply",

          "text": "At the risk of an unpopular view, and the inevitable downvotes, I think it's worth stating the following; If your business model is raising money from VCs then doing things VCs want is important to getting paid. All businesses tailor their output to suit their customer. Your customer is VCs. So you need to tailor your output accordingly. In this sense your business partner is not wrong. There's no point on working on things that excite you, if it doesn't excite them. That's a hobby. Sure, pivoting too often is also wrong. So you should try to improve that. At this point it's probably worth sitting down with your partner with the fundamental understanding she is right; You need to find something to attract the next investor. However you need to stick with it, success or fail. You've thrown a lot against the wall, now it's time to choose. Of course you'll likely fail. Most businesses do. VC based businesses at an even higher rate because your customer base is so small. But even failure is OK because VCs are looking for founders, not successes. Make no mistake; founding a startup is hard work. Not fun stuff. Not interesting stuff. Mostly it's just work. Being a founder isn't about coding. It's about business. You need to bring more to the table than just coding. Just like your co-founder takes an interest in the technical side, so you need to take more than a passing interest in the business side. In any business, sales is the most important thing. Without them you will fail. Tech supports sales, not the other way around. I'm sorry that this sounds harsh. I don't mean it that way. I wish you success. That success starts with you realizing the truth at the heart of your partners position. Start there. Fix your relationship. Good luck! reply",

I’ve seen this archetype before—a business person with just enough technical knowledge to chime in on complex product decisions, but without the patience or interest to develop any real depth. Instead of building real understanding, they rely on mimicking what looks successful. Always chasing whatever has funding or buzz. That kind of thinking lacks vision and makes it really hard to build anything meaningful. Over time, it wears you down. Even if the product “works,” it doesn’t feel good because you know you're forcing it. These folks tend to say things like “this should be easy,” then only show up to question why something isn’t done. They manufacture urgency instead of clarity, and when things inevitably fall short, the blame falls on the technical team. Second, you’re not a first-time founder anymore. Life’s short. For me at least, you’ve earned the right to walk away and build something you actually care about again. reply",

The remaining founder will need that equity to offer outsize offers to senior (and eventually C-level) folks to replace them. And it's demoralizing for the remaining founder and team to be working extremely hard to make the company successful, while the departed founder reaps  the rewards with no effort. Opinions will differ here, but I think if you're leaving a pre-PMF startup you've created essentially no durable value, and should return nearly all of your equity. I've heard of startups doing 10 year vesting for founders (with double trigger) to align this better. reply",

          "text": "I have been a similar situation before. Yes, walk away — and learn what you can. There's one easy part of your situation, which is that your immediate next step is clear. I think it's clear because it sounds like the two of you have a fundamental disagreement about how to choose a direction. There's also a power imbalance if you've consistently been going along with pivots that you don't want to execute on. If you think you can resolve things, then maybe I'm wrong. I'm basing my advice on the fact that this is 24 months in — enough time for you to know how easy it'd be to get back to \"we like working together and are on a path to success.\" Now for the hard parts:\n* You want to act as professionally as possible in walking away. Communicate clearly, being fair to both yourself and the other people involved. I think it's easy to err to far on either side (either too defensive/passive \"nice to yourself\" or too deferential \"nice to others\").\n* It can be tempting to think of this is as your cofounder's fault, but that's not constructive, and it's better to learn toward your future actions. For example, how could you have seen this problem earlier? My guess is that you were never \"cofounder compatible,\" and this is a chance to get better at identifying that compatibility with others (useful for both startups and other jobs). It's not a fun situation, and I hope things go well for you. reply",

In both cases our original business idea didn't work out, and we were trying to stay alive. It felt like pivoting from idea to idea.

If your heart is not 100% in it (for whatever reason) I'd suggest walking away. The opportunity cost of dragging the dead weight of a business that you're not bought into (and that you aren't seeing success with) is simply too high - and can have real life consequences (finances, stresses, etc). There's nothing wrong with walking away - there's a reason the overwhelming majority of startups fail. And most tiny startups fail due to co-founder relationships - doesn't have anything to do with PMF or anything. Think about it over a weekend - have the tough conversation(s) - don't burn the bridge.

          "text": "Mr Stuck, I went through this and have strong feelings about it. I think the most important answer is to a question you aren't asking. *How to predict market demand for a new product.* It sounds like neither you or your co-founder know how to do this, and that's the problem. I don't have enough context to understand if the differences between you and your co-founder are unreconcilable, if they are, then maybe the answer is to move on, but if you mostly get along but are just struggling with an extremely uncomfortable and challenging situation, then here are some things to consider... First off, learn about Nonviolent Communication. If both you and your co-founder are willing to adopt it, that should help you improve your collaboration. Next, you probably need to cut your burn down to near-zero if you haven't already. Even if you have a decent amount of cash, if you and your co-founder still have enough control to make this decision, lay off everyone that isn't essential to servicing existing customers. If you have no customers, then cut everyone. Cut down to the smallest possible burn you can, to give you the most possible runway. Then, address your complete lack of market research skills, either by committing wholeheartedly to learning how to do it yourselves, or by finding a third co-founder who is really good at it. What you need is someone who has a decent grasp of technology trends and value-overhang, and who is very good at doing market research interviews (customer discovery interviews), and thinking through lenses like Jobs to be Done Theory, Outcome Driven Innovation and Design Thinking. When I say market research I don't mean some proctor and gamble quant nerd, I mean a scrappy startup bloodhound. Not all \"business people\" are built the same, and it would be good for you to ramp up the resolution of your evaluations of people in these roles. Then you need to come together to pick a group of people to focus on for AT LEAST 3 months. These need to be people you can access and talk to many of, and people who you have good reason to believe are all doing or trying to do very similar things. Read more about jobs to be done theory if you don't know what I mean. Here are some examples: (Startup founders, insurance brokers, nurses, teachers, parents raising two or more toddlers, robotics engineers, etc. - PICK ONE). Ideally you want to pick people who have money to spend themselves, have some authority or influence over how some money is spent, or whose work is important enough that making them more productive would be exciting to people who have influence. For example, elementary school teachers are probably not as attractive as a market as university professors, and private school elementary teachers are probably better than public school. If your founder is sensitive about engaging in this process without certainty that you will find an opportunity that's big enough to justify the VC investment, then consider focusing on a group of people like described above with high economic leverage (e.g. fintech CEOs, data-center architects, etc.) ~ focus on a set of people doing similar things close to where the money is flowing fast. Once you pick the group of people, you need to resist the urge to come up with any product ideas. Your next step isn't to ideate or innovate or whatever, its to go and empathize with the people. Get really fucking curious about what the people actually care about. Find a way to not want them to have specific wants. Read this again: Set yourself up to be curious about these people's actual wants, while not wanting them to have certain wants. It's way more fun to talk to people this way, you won't have the tension of \"I hope they validate our idea\", and they will enjoy talking to you because it will feel like therapy to them if you do it right. Ask things like \"What's the most important thing to you that you are the least satisfied with?\", and \"What else?\", \"if you could wave a magic wand...?\", ask follow up questions, \"has anything changed about that recently? Is it getting worse? How does it work today? Why does it work that way? How important is that step?, etc.\", make sure you understand all their answers. Listen actively. Stay curious. Empathize. Consider reading The Mom Test. You will be better off paying the targeted interviewees hundreds of dollars to spend an hour talking to you (2-3x their hourly salary), than spending that money on employees helping you flail around. If you can get their time for free, great! Once you start targeting a specific problem, it makes more sense to not pay for their time, since the chance of solving the problem can become the new motivation for speaking with you. After you have talked to ~30 or so people like this, you are fairly likely to spot an opportunity (You have also started to develop a very valuable skill). What you are looking for is something that a decent segment (e.g. 30%+) of the sample consider the most important thing they are trying to get done that they are the least satisfied with, or at least in the top 3, and that you think you can make a huge impact on with some emerging tech. Whatever you do needs to genuinely seem 10x better from the customers perspective, because the new benefit has to be worth the risk of spending time and money on something unproven / doesn't exist yet. The best opportunities will come from when you can re-frame the problems they are struggling with and understand them better than any one of the people you interviewed, because you got some unique perspective from talking to many people. Just don't rush this, because it has to be grounded in the reality of their existing values. After you gain the insight and have designed a new approach that you are highly confident at least a handful of the people will be excited about, go back to them and validate it. Ask the hard and scary questions (now with all that validation tension again), that they can and will pay money for it, or fight hard to get other people to pay for it, etc. If you did everything right up to this point, at least a handful of people will start pulling the product out of you. When you reach this point, at least 90% of the problems you described will be gone and you will have new (slightly better) problems. This is startups. <3 If you can't bring yourself to do something at least close to what I described above, then you're probably better off moving on, since the odds of succeeding from your current situation by pure luck is near-zero. That said, I encourage you to take the courageous and responsible path if you have it in you, the world needs more of it, and you will grow a lot from it. Sincerely,\nFloorEgg reply",

          "text": "I have realized this morning, when I was riding in the bus, that my habit of creating a new side project every 6 months, working on it for maybe 2-3 months of relatively high productivity, and suddenly losing interests afterwards (usually not finished, or not polished), probably means that programming is an addiction to me. No one is using my project, and I'm not exactly learning a lot from them, except in the first half of each one because whatever afterwards is just polishing (e.g. I did an interpreter project on a Python subset a year ago, and TBH the whole concept was pretty straightforward once my brain got it in the first few weeks). It's more of an obsession and that probably explains why I got burned out after 2-3 months and COMPLETELY lost interests in it. Looking at my GitHub commit history, it is always 2-3 months of almost daily commits compensated by 3 months of absolutely non-activity. I don't think this is the right path for me if I want to leverage my side projects to get a job in low-level programming. Either I figure out how to drill deeper into each of my projects, or I need to figure out how to remove the burnout every 2-3 months. If the market is good I'd go straight to apply for system programming jobs but right now it's even tough to keep my own job. So this is my unpopular opinions about side project programming -- if you are like me, maybe it's time to rethink the strategy. We only have one life, and I'm already 42. Gosh! Maybe I (we) should just find another hobby. reply",

          "text": "Strong types are not orthogonal to dynamic types, but I'll assume you're referring to static typing instead. My opinion on this is static type systems are great and provide amazing fit when you can model an entire system (e.g. a compiler). I think they are overrated for typical business software subject to change over time. IMO this is because business data tends to outlive any particular code base, or compiler version. The way I see it is there's a spectrum of ways of handling this, from type systems, validation code, documentation, integration tests (validating runtime behaviour), and static analysis tooling, but I don't agree that a static type system is the best (and is often only barely adequate) way of integrating modules. The optimal solution is going to vary based on each project's requirements: e.g., is the modular code going to be consumed via networked API or as a library, and is it internally controlled or third-party? How many teams are going to be working on it? How much care has been taken with backwards compatibility? If we break the interface of some random minor function every update, a static type system may help, then again if it's just for our team: who cares? I'm sure we've all seen updates make internal modifications that break runtime behaviour but don't alter data models or function signatures in a way that get's picked up by a compiler. Even in the most extreme type systems, interfaces are eventually going to need documentation and examples to explain domain/business logic peculiarities. What if a library interface requires a list in sorted order? Is it better to leak a LibrarySortedList type into the caller codebase? The modularity starts to break down. The alternative is use a standard library generic List type, but you can't force the data to be sorted. To encode this type of info we need dependent types or similar. A different example would be a database connection library, every database supports different key/value pairs for connection strings. If the database library released a patch which deprecated support for some arbitrary connection string param, you wouldn't find out until someone tried to run the code. Static analysis tools may catch common things like connection strings, but IME there's always some custom \"stringly\" typed values in business applications, living in a DB schema written 10+ years ago. We also have to consider that the majority of our data arrives serialised, from files or over the wire. It's necessarily constrained to generic wire protocols, which have lower fidelity than data parsed into a more featured type system. Given that this type of data is getting validated or rejected directly after deserialisation, how much extra value is derived from having the compiler reiterate your validation code? Non-zero for sure, but probably not as much as we like to think. reply",

          "text": "That's fascinating. You should do a writeup about it! I had thought (perhaps incorrectly? it's not something I've spent a lot of time pondering) that a stateful connection like this is fragile in the real world compared to HTTP because it requires some sort of manual reconnection to the server on network changes (like if you're on a phone in a train or in a car), and that it would require both the server and app itself to be aware of what is dynamic realtime data, what is cacheable, what is stale, etc. Like kinda related to your other statement about state... doesn't this mean you're sharing and syncing state across both the server and the client? Competitive video games operating over UDP are the closest everyday analogy I can think of, where the server handles most state (and is the ultimate source of truth) but the client optimistically approximates some stuff (like player movement and aiming), which usually works fine but can lead to rubber-banding issues and such if some packets are missed. But most gaming happens between one server and just a small handful of clients (maybe 100 or 200 at most?). In a web app, would the same sort of setup lead to UI jank, like optimistic updates often flicking and back and forth, etc.? I suppose that's not inherent to either HTTP or websockets, though, just depends on how it's coded and how resilient it is to network glitches. And how would this scale... you can't easily CDN a websockets app, right, or use serverless to handle writes? You'd have to have a persistent stateful backend of some sort? One of the things I like about the usual way we do HTTP is that it can batch a bunch of updates into a single call and send that as one single atomic request that succeeds or fails in its entirety (vs an ongoing stream), and it doesn't really matter if that request was one second or one minute after the previous one as long as the server still knows the session it was a part of. Like on both the client and the server, the state could be \"eventually\" consistent as opposed to requiring a stable, real-time sync between the two? Not disagreeing with you per se (hope it didn't sound that way), just thinking out loud and wondering how the details play out in a setup like this. I'm definitely intrigued! reply",

          "text": "It is the same level of fragility compared to HTTP because most HTTP connections now are stateless keep-alive connections.  The solution to this fragility is to open a new connection after the prior connection breaks.  You will know when the WebSocket connection breaks in both the browser and Node because there is an event exactly for that.  That new connection request can occur via timed intervals or as needed at next message, depending upon concerns of directionality and urgency. Transmission is not a function of state.  Your application gains greater durability when those two qualities become fully independent of each other. Transmission jank is a concern for web servers that come down and then back up with restoration of many concurrent connections.  The solution to that is stagger connection establishment in batches and intervals.  This is not a normal operating concern though, because how often does your web server crash on you in production if you have 10,000 or more active connections. As for CDNs leave static asset requests to HTTP.  For performance these files should be consolidated to the fewest number of requests balanced against initial rendering concerns in the browser.  This should also typically be limited to initial page request. reply",

Even back in the pre .NET days, when Microsoft pretty much did have a monopoly on PC desktops, Visual Studio (not VSCode, but its full-fledged big brother) had pretty awesome DX. And having a standard UI layer (like WinForms) made GUI development way way better for both the developer (who could drag and drop shapes and easily align frames and tabs and buttons and such instead of having to try to wrangle CSS) and the average user could have standard UI looks & feels across many different apps. The openness of the Web led to its popularity (and my career), but then every company ended up making their code style, IDE, APIs, UI layers, etc., leading to extreme fragmentation in both DX and UX that to this day is still a mess. Of course I still prefer this over a closed Microsoft monopoly (or an Apple one), but it's certainly made for a lot of unnecessary reinventions of the wheel. reply",

Reference is not a proof, it's information that you have to check yourself if you want the latter. I guess same will happen with LLMs. Any link to a chat will be met by some with \"ew, llm\" regardless of the fact whether it's checked and informative and saves effort to formulate, or is just-generated crap. With all the issues with llms, it's us who don't understand the basics when it comes to handling the info. This is by semi-natural social design, I believe. reply",

This way it's comfy to write on (soft surface) and it leaves a nice afterimage on a file after a while, which is visible at an angle in daylight. Very cozy and professional, plus doesn't collect dust. I also put a sheet back under if it has any value, so I can address it later. But usually I strike out points, rewrite what's left on a new sheet and bin the old one. I tend to use thin-ish gel pens cause you can add details in fine strokes if needed. For space management I'm using an arm mount for the display, so that the keyboard can go all the way under it, leaving space for the paper. I also tend to work at long tables, at least outstretched arms long, so it has enough space for everything including \"amenities\", because otherwise the logistic issues start piling up and harm the setting. reply",

          "text": "I agree that a debugger is a great tool; in particular, knowing how to set conditional breakpoints and how to read a stack trace allows you to do things that are nearly impossible in other ways. I can give a example story below, but first: There's a larger point here that *debugging methodology* in general is a key skill that many programmers seem to overlook or take for granted, and even think they are good at it while making wasteful mistakes -- real Dunning-Kruger material here. * I can't tell you the number of times I've seen developers get a hunch and waste too much time going down a rabbit hole, instead of devising a test to attempt to disprove the hypothesis before plowing into a huge code review and seeing ghosts in every shadow of the codebase. * Print statements for debugging aren't necessarily always the wrong tool, but the mindset should be that they are code and can have bugs too. Good debug logging should be part of the code telemetry infrastructure, so you can toggle it on/off. If it's going to be written and deleted, then use a debugger instead. Actually this post is getting long so I'll stop now, but I could go on for several paragraphs. Oh wait, I promised a debugger story. One time I started a new job, they assigned me a bug that other developers had spent a lot of time on but never resolved. It was a random crash, in a game, that rarely happened in less than 12 hours of continuous runtime, typically after 18 hours. The crash occurred even when the game was idle with no player input. The crash stack trace was very different in many instances, so the failure was happening some time/distance after its cause. My first pass was to devise tests to eliminate subsystems: try to repro the crash after disabling all graphics/animation, another test that disabled all audio/input, etc. That led to narrowing it down to a problem with the music. Telemetry showed no memory leaks, it was not running out of heap. The music playback was in a thread, double-buffered. I added a bunch of conditional breakpoints that were based on assert-like conditionals. One of those caught the interrupt happening in between two statements that should have been in a critical section. Instead of using a mutex around the whole thing, I just switched the double buffer logic to a queue, which resolved the problem. reply",

One big part of Flutter was that it was a hedge against Java lawsuits back in the day. The other was that it was experimenting with some mobile code, like designing it around lifecycles and all the async UI. But now the same paradigms have been adopted by iOS and Android. Unlike BE, mobile moves quite quickly too; the last few years have been deprecating a lot of things like push notification security and file access. Mostly to deal with dark patterns. So a platform that isn't in active maintenance tends to fall apart quickly like we've seen with many mobile libraries, Cordova, etc. reply",

It does RAG but Supabase does that better too. Firebase functions are really good for prototyping, but once it starts to cost money, we move it to AWS. It's good for feature flagging, and we moved that to Growthbook. Analytics started on Firebase and were moved to open source so we'd own the data. The only thing they do well is Crashlytics and that's free. If everyone was as bad a customer as us, I would assume they're in trouble. Unfortunately a lot of people have trust issues with Google. We don't want them controlling data and certainly nothing as core as functions, DB, and feature flagging. Then when people don't use these things, Google kills it real fast. reply",

          "text": "That’s a fair point — ecosystems naturally evolve with competing frameworks, and sometimes that diversity helps the best ideas emerge. But in those examples (PHP vs. .NET vs. Django, React vs. Angular), we usually see clear differences in philosophy, performance, developer experience, or use case fit. What I find puzzling in the current wave of AI agent libraries is that many seem to be doing almost exactly the same thing — wrapping LLMs, defining tools, planning steps — just with slightly different APIs or names. It’s hard to see a fundamental divergence in capability or vision, at least so far. So my question is less about why variety exists — and more about whether this current fragmentation is actually productive, or just noise driven by branding and platform lock-in strategies. Would love to be wrong here if others are seeing more substantial innovation beneath the surface. reply",

          "text": "Part of the reason bit torrent works really well is that the file is downloaded in random order. It lets everyone cooperate, while still being robust to bad peers, bad network connections, churn etc. If you want live high quality streaming, a lot of reasons bit torrent works so well goes away. Latency matters. In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. In bit torrent, everyone can divide the work - clients try to download the part of the file the least number of people have, quickly rare parts of the file spread everywhere. In streaming everyone needs the same piece at the same time. Bit torrent punishes people who dont contribute by deprioritizing sending stuff to peers that freeride. It can do this on the individual level. In a p2p streaming setup, you probably have some peers getting the feed, and then sending it to other peers. The relationship isnt reciperocal so its harder to punish freeriders as you can't at the local level know if the peer you are sending data to is pushing data to the other nodes it is supposed to or not. I'm sure some of these have work arounds, but they are hard problems that aren't really satisfactorily solved reply",

In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. First of all, BitTorrent clients do not download in random order or wait 5 minutes. They usually download the rarest block first, but can do whatever they want, whenever they want. Second, standard HLS sets a nominal segment size of 6 seconds (some implementations will go as high as 10 seconds), and a client will usually cache multiple segments before playing (e.g., 3). This mean that you have 18 seconds before a segment becomes critical. This is not a difficult thing for a P2P network to handle. You'd adapt things to introduce timing information and manage number of hops, but each client can maintain a connection to a number of other clients and have sufficient capacity to fill a segment if a connection fails. Various strategies could be used to distribute load while avoiding latency penalties. Low-latency HLS uses much smaller segments and would be more demanding, but isn't impossible to manage. > BitTorrent punishes people who dont contribute Private communities punish this behavior, BitTorrent clients do not. Most new downloads will appear as freeriders for a long time, and only over long periods far exceeding the download time will enough compatible seeding opportunities arise for them to contribute in any substantial way. The network does not need everyone to seed, it only needs enough people to seed. reply",

(Note my client is still there if somebody needs a rare block) I remember some Bittorrent networks circa 2005 or so which tried to monitor you and punish you for not contributing and this was a disaster for me since my upload is necessarily a small fraction of my download.  What I found is that kind of network seemed to perform poorly even when I had a good bidirectional connection.

You should understand my argument more as a sketch of proof. That being said I have a small correction. If you want to stream to two peers (that is you have a network with 3 fully connected nodes, one being the originator of the stream) and the link latency for all links is 20ms, then your lowest latency path to each node is exactly 20ms, as the originating node could simply send the content to each client. The unfortunate realization is that 20ms is then also the optimal stream delay, assuming you care about the shortest possible latency for your live streaming service. The clients will therefore end up with the content exactly when they were supposed to show it, and therefore they would have no time to forward it to anyone else, lest that downstream would get the content AFTER they were supposed to show it. reply",

          "text": "I don't think people are appreciating the nuance of what you're saying. Most of what you are saying isn't accurate for netflix style streaming, which would actually be more aptly called \"video on demand\", but is very applicable to \"live streaming\" in the sense of live sporting events or news broadcasts. Video-on-demand is perfectly implementable on top of BitTorrent. As you say, there are some latency pitfalls you'll have to avoid, but that's nothing you can't hack yourself out of. Livestreaming is a different beast. As you say, the problem with livestreaming is that everyone needs the same content at the same time. If I spend 200ms downloading the next 500ms worth of content, then there's nobody to share it with, they all spent the 200ms doing the same. BitTorrent relies on the time shift that is allowed between me downloading the content and you requesting it. If you request it before I've got it, well I can't fulfil that request, only the guy I intend to get it from can. If you wanted to implement something like that, you would probably pick a tree of seeders where the protocol would pick a subset of trusted nodes that it would upload the content to before then allowing them to seed it, and the have them doing the same recursively. That would obviously introduce a bunch of complexity and latency, and would very much not be BitTorrent anymore. reply",

For example, say you have a cluster of people on the call in the US and another cluster in the UK. Ping times are 100ms or more across the ocean, there will be some random packets lost, but ping times within the UK are around 15ms max. By working co-operatively and sharing among themselves the clients in one cluster can fill in missing packets from a different cluster far quicker than the requesting them from the originating host. In general, the ability to request missing packets from a more local source should be able to improve overall video call quality. It still might be \"too late\", because for minimal latency, you might choose to use packets as soon as they arrive and maybe even treat out-of-order packets as missing, and just display a blockier video instead, but if the clients can tolerate a little more latency (maybe a tunable setting, like 50ms more than the best case) then it should in theory work better than current systems. I've been mulling over some of these ideas myself in the past, but it's never been high enough on my TODO list to try anything out. reply",

That's only true if you assume the nodes operate sequentially, which is not given. If the nodes operate independently from one another (which they would, being non-cooperating) they'd all get a response in ~100ms (computation and signaling time is negligible here), which is faster than they could get it cooperatively, even if we assume perfect cooperation (100ms for the first local node + 15ms from there). It's parallelism. Doing less work might seem theoretically nice, but if you have the capacity to do the same work twice simultaneously you avoid the synchronization. Basically, it falls somewhere in my loose \"tree based system\" sketch. In this case the \"trusted\" nodes would be picked based on ping time clustering, but the basic sketch that you pick a subset of nodes to be your local nodes and then let that structure recursively play out is the same. The problem you run into is latency. There's no good way to pick a global latency figure for the whole network, since it varies by how deep into the tree you are. As the tree grows deeper, you end up having to retune the delay. The only other option is to grow in width at which point you've just created a another linear growth problem, albeit with a lower slope. reply",

This P2P stack was meant to allow for mass scaling of lowish latency video streaming, even in parts of the World with limited peer bandwidth to original content source servers. The VC-1 format got into a legal quagmire, as most video streaming protocols do, and it speaks volumes that by the time I turned up in ~2012-ish, the entire stack was RTMP, RTSP, HDS and HLS with zero evidence of that P2P tech stack in production. My main role was to get the ingest stack out of a DC and into cloud, while also dealing with a myriad of poor design decisions that led to issues (yes, that 2013 outage in the first paragraph of the wiki article was on my watch). At no point did anybody suggest to me that what we really needed to fix our attention back to was P2P streaming, beyond the fact the company built a version of Periscope (Twitter's first live streaming product), and launched it weeks/months before they did, and were pivoting towards a social media platform, at which point I decided to go do other things. The technical and legal problems are real, and covered elsewhere here. People want reliable delivery. Even Spotify, YouTube and others who have licensed content and could save a pile by moving to DRM-ified P2P don't go near it, and that should tell you something about the challenges. I'd love more widespread adoption of P2P tech, but not convinced we'll ever see it in AV any time soon, unfortunately. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveStation reply",

The primary problem is you oftentimes don't get people who want to share back or who have firewalls or other connections that don't allow them to share back. So you end up with a few people who end up seeding everything out. The second problem is in order to watch a streaming protocol things need to arrive in order. It is totally possible to do with BitTorrent and request the blocks in the order that you want but you may not always be able to get them in the order you want. In general people aren't tolerant of lag and spinning circles and other such things when they're trying to watch streaming content. If you're fine with just watching it a little bit later might as well queue it up and left the whole thing down load so it's ready when you're ready. reply",

I think you would probably need something more in the neighbourhood of 10 minutes to really make a difference. If you could make a stable p2p live streaming app with the number of peers all watching the same stream in the hundreds and only 30 seconds latency, i'd consider that pretty amazing. > Also do you think there's any way you can prioritize seeders in such a protocol? like some kind of algorithm that the more you share the more you're prioritized in getting the most up to date packets. If we are talking about a livestream (and not \"netflix\" type streaming) then i don't think seeders are a thing. You can't seed a file that isn't finished being created yet. If you mean more generally punishing free-riders, i think  that is difficult in a live stream as generally data would be coming in from a different set of peers than the peers you are sending data out to, so its difficult (maybe not impossible) to know who is misbehaving. reply",

Media companies are generally pretty secretive about their tech (Netflix being the exception to this rule), so there isn't much to be found about this. The piracy community (because, let's be real here) also won't be interested in a non-free (speech and beer) streaming solutions like these. So that's probably why there is just very little public information available.

It's closed source through and the UI was a forked version of VLC - it's also been suspected to spread malware - CLI tools look fine through but who knows. Surprisingly the channels that are available work really well if you just use the mpegts stream. In a past life I've added a few channels to a tvheadend instance on a VPS. It reliable crashed Kodi watching some channels and I've wondered if it's just broken streams or something more interesting is going on. If you open the ports and watch popular channels it's easily saturating bandwidth - there is no limit. I've since stopped using it it's the kind of thing that breaks not often enough to be not useless but often enough to be annoying. It's IPv4 only and seems to use it's own tracker or at least calls to some URLs for initial peer discovery. Building something similar as true open source would be great but I guess the usecase is mostly illegal streaming. Be careful - it's attempting to use upnp to open ports on the router and even if just looking through the lists makes you upload fragments. Still fascinating tool. It's getting to close to what op is looking for but I think it has scalability issues and everything about it is kind of shady and opaque. reply",

As someone who genuinely is interested in crypto from a technology (decentralization perspective) I see transactions as a byproduct not the end result & I see people wanting to earn a quick buck feel really weird. Also crypto isn't safe. I just think like now its better to correlate as a tech stock though 99% of the time, its run by scams, so absolutely worse. The technology is still fascinating. But just because the technology is fascinating doesn't mean its valuable. Many people are overselling their stuff. That being said, I have actually managed to use crypto to create a permanent storage (something like ipfs but its forced to store it forever) , so I think this can be used where anonymity/decentralized is required. But still, this thing could be done without including money in the process as well & crypto is still not as decentralized as one might imagine. reply",

          "text": "I am a contributor to Iroh ( https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh ), an open source library for direct QUIC connections between devices that can be behind a NAT. Our library is general purpose and can be used whenever you need direct connections, but on top of Iroh we also provide iroh-blobs, which provides BLAKE3 verified streaming over our QUIC connections. Blobs currently is a library that provides low level primitives and point to point streaming (see e.g. https://www.iroh.computer/sendme as an example/demo ) We are currently working on extending blobs to also allow easy concurrent downloading from multiple providers. We will also provide pluggable content discovery mechanisms as well as a lightweight content tracker implementation. There is an experimental tracker here: https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-experiments/tree/main/co... Due to the properties of the BLAKE3 tree hash you can start sharing content even before you have completely downloaded it, so blobs is very well suited to the use case described above. We already did a few explorations regarding media streaming over iroh connections, see for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3qqyu1mmGQ . The big advantage of iroh over bittorrent is that content can be shared efficiently from even behind routers that don't allow manual or automatic port mapping, such as many carrier grade NAT setups. Another advantage that BLAKE3 has over the bittorrent protocol is that content is verified incrementally . If somebody sends you wrong data you will notice after at most ~16 KiB. Bittorrent has something similar in the form of piece hashes, but those are more coarse grained. Also, BLAKE3 is extremely fast due to a very SIMD friendly design. We are big fans of bittorrent and actually use parts of bittorrent, the mainline DHT, for our node discovery. Here is a talk from last year explaining how iroh works in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj-7Y_7p4Dg , also briefly covering the blobs protocol. reply",

My experience is, passwords are a 1 second affair: open website, tap credential highlighted by password manager, trigger face/touch id or whatever exists on android/windows, done. Email experience: open website, click login, get some link, go to another app, wait for it to pull emails, look for email, open email, click link, opens in browser, maybe not the same browser where you opened the app, so go back and copy link, realize copying links from email buttons is not easy on mobile, finally login. If this is where you guys want this to go, it sucks. How can we improve it? Maybe we need to implement some wait to do what apple does when you get a 2FA code via sms? It just shows it to you in app instead of having you open messages app? reply",

I don't have to remember what password is used where (minimizing the risk of one big password for all sites), no monolithic mammoth-authentication-systems with a single/multiple point-of-failures, no auth-gate-keepers. The problems with passwords you mention, are valid. But, the same situation will happen for authentication - your mom can't remember her email account's pwd, but then you want her to remember facebook, google and all the other services' pwds?? Just think about where is the difference of \"remember email pwd\" and \"remember 1Password pwd\" ?? absolutely no difference. So, while I understand your points, I'm thinking, magic links are the easiest and failure proof and user friendly way, to verify the user. Another point is: Onboarding is very fast. The new user doesn't even need to bother with input of pwds, verfication, etc ... for me: please no account creation in the old style. Give me magic links.

I generally don't mind having one or the other, so either password or magic link. What I can't stand is having both in the same login flow: - Enter your email - Get sent a magic link - Open magic link - Continue and enter your password - Enter your 2FA as well - Smash computer reply",

          "text": "My take, Low security should use passwords. None of that fancy &@73gdb-Whb stuff. Just a regular word. Suitable for Netflix and meditation apps that want a basic login to prove that you paid. Medium security should use magic links and a simple password that you don't need to write. If you lose your email, the password prevents hackers from taking over your app. If you lose your password, hackers can't take over your device. Suited for something like social media or MMOs, which are targeted very often. High security might need proper 2FA with auth app, password rotation, stuff like that. Probably shouldn't be necessary unless there's constant active attempts to hack. Everyone gets attacked, especially in the era of AI, but I'm saying at least 10 attacks a day. You can also layer on extra levels of security, but IMO that's about the level you should expect from users. reply",

If you control the email address signed up with, you have \"god\" access to the account (can perform password resets, etc).  They essentially outsourced security to your email provider.

If my email's hacked, I don't want that to pwn my other stuff. 2FA helps but often there are ways around it if you control the email account. reply",

          "text": "IMO you don’t need to build a full app or company. You could just build a series of niche sites or properties. If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it. Some possible ideas: Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity. Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense. Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc). Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad. You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough reply",

If you're super keen, pick a problen to solve and build a conpany. Open source all the above code on github and use it as a funnel with links back to your new company site.

Unless you have business connections and raised funding from people who do, open source wil not help gain any additional adoption or raise awareness of your project. This only worked in the past. 2. Hardly anybody who does happen to use your open source project will pay you. You need massive global exposure just to make a developers' standard salary... I remember for years Evan You who built VueJS was getting like $120k max in sponsorships annually (I think it was Patreon), at the peak... And VueJS was extremely popular at the time and being updated frequently... And companies got something (e.g. exposure) in exchange for the sponsorship. 3. It doesn't matter how good it is. Implementation details don't really matter. If your product is useful, some big tech company will build an inferior alternative but promote it like crazy. Nobody will even know your project exists. It doesn't matter if your product is better for many use cases; people won't know it exists so that fact is irrelevant. 4. At best, some big tech monopoly will use your open source code to train their AI to replace you in the marketplace or drive down your wages. People like Linus, DHH, Matt Mullenweg, Solomon Hykes... Who made millions; are from a different epoch and different place too. Not happening anymore. Don't be fooled. They all had to move to Silicon Valley at some point. It's a big club and you ain't in it. My advice is; if you can't sell it, keep your code and use for yourself and your friends/family. reply",

Okay...so it isn't \"sustainable\". So you stop maintaining it. So what? You made a neat thing. You had fun making it. You shared it with others because you thought it was neat, and maybe someone else found it useful too. That's the happy ending of a happy story.

Some criticize you that some of your free stuff is not the best quality and demand better service. Then you find out the local grocer is stopping by every day to take it all and sell it in his store.

I'd say about 25% of my time is the fun part of writing the code (that just works for me.) The rest is in debugging the code for all the edge cases, writing docs, examples, training, support etc. In other words the \"work\" part. Minimally you need to do enough so that someone can use the code. The code itself has minimal value, the value is in the using. Then you need to figure out how to reach an audience. Then you need to decide if the user will pay, or maybe it's ad supported. Or maybe donations. Hint: unless you have a large audience this will result in very minimal income. Is all this extra work worth it? You can Open Source it, but frankly its unlikely anyone will find it or use it. It might be an interesting line on your CV, bit again probably of marginal value there. My advice is that if it has little to no value to others, just move on. reply",

          "text": "[citation needed] No dude, the central question in this thread is “When?” Realtime, accurate, up-to-the-minute manifest information is sensitive. Manifest information from last week, perhaps less so—especially considering other ways to infer movement of people. But being able to know, “bdangubic just presented a boarding pass at El-Al Gate 8A in Kiev” or the details of USPS cargo stowed in the downbelow; or “AStonesThrow just 3 seconds ago landed with 74 other souls at KSFO and there are 11 Lyft Drivers nearby” that’s the crux of sensitivity. Like where to aim the MANPADS. furthermore, passenger manifest data is not one blob of perfectly accurate information, like the digits of pi. it's ever-changing, and so the accuracy matters when considering the value, and the resale value, of such data. and the costs of litigation. imagine that a preliminary manifest is you know two weeks prior to the flights departure. and it gets leaked. it's preliminary, and it indicates who's booked the flight, but you have no idea who's actually going to board the flight or who did if this is looking in retrospective. or I mean you can conceive of situations where a manifest would change while in flight. for instance somebody checks in and boards the flight, but they get sucked out of a door. or they die on route. and so the body shows up but the passengers soul is no longer present. Conversely, a hypothetical,pregnant mother boards a flight in shanghai, she gives birth to triplets, and these additional “formerly uterine passengers” land in San Francisco. how's that manifest look? and so that's going to affect the accuracy, and therefore the value, of your manifest when considering sales to third parties, or litigation situations. or you know regilatory Federal Agency fines and stuff court fees. Private jets and General Aviation have other rules. I don’t know what happens when Dad takes 8 children on a Piper Cub from Podunk Field Runway 18, but perhaps that’s going to be sold 30 days after they land safely? At that point in time, it hardly matters who reads a list, compared to the realtime shit you assert without citing any reliable sources. reply",

The inputs may change, the outputs may change. I personally think that sql and duckdb are well positioned to do this. SQL is declarative, standardized and has decades worth of mature implementations. The “source” can be modeled as a table. The “sink” can also be modeled as a table. What does a custom dsl provide over sql? I have a side project called Sqlflow which is attempting to do something similar/ https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow It’s not a DSL but the pipeline is standardized using the source, process, sink stages.\nRight now the process is pure sql but the source and sink are declarative.

What worries me most, though, is that because of exactly the reasons you’ve described — and now, with the rise of GenAI that makes generating boilerplate imperative code even easier — we might be permanently missing the opportunity to invent a better, more elegant solution. Instead of challenging the underlying paradigm, we’re accelerating its replication — just with fewer keystrokes. GenAI is helping us pave cow paths, not design highways. My fear is that the convenience of generating \"good enough\" code at scale will solidify suboptimal workflows, and the space for reimagining them might quietly close forever. reply",

          "text": "Can you clarify what angle of the existing solution you don’t like? The example you give of the Unix pipeline is pretty similar to what we do with pandas pipeline chains. (pd.read_json(…)\n    .join(pd.read_json(…))\n    .assign(\n        texts=…,\n        embeddings=…,\n    )\n    .pipe(extract_something)\n    .query(some_filter)\n    .pipe(send_somewhere, batch=50)) (this is just thrown together, untested, on mobile, and I’m not sure what your data looks like exactly, or how you’re transforming it, but that’s the general form) Is it the syntax you don’t like, or your data is too large to fit in memory, or what aspect? This can certainly be made more concise if desired, if we want to wrap things in classes, decorators, context managers, overload the actual pipe operator, or other syntactic sugar mechanisms. Most tools you find will be aimed at handling scale, and in the name of efficiency will therefore be in a columnar form, which is why you see a bunch of tools that do this already but only on tabular data. JSON is slow to work with beyond the initial load, so often you’d see it loaded into pandas or polars, maybe with minor transformation, then dumped to parquet files for some downstream tool to pick up and process. These systems are also geared toward being robust. In a real world system there are all kinds of unexpected errors to handle. What happens if the API you’re pushing to is down, or starts rate limiting you, or someone added a new field or renamed a field or your two data sets don’t have matching keys? Real pipelines have to account for this, and depending on your scenario you might want to retry, or roll back changes, and this can get ridiculously complicated because in API land you often don’t have any analogous concept of transactions and rollback like exist in SQL, so without a distributed transaction coordinator (it’s own complexity), streaming data will lead to distributed systems drifting out of sync. And now you need a batch job on top of your streaming data to ensure it hasn’t fallen out of sync (so in reality, unless you have heavy complexity needs, just use SQL so you have transactions, or just use batch jobs). But that’s the reason you don’t see this record-based fire-and-forget approach, because it’s too slow and lacks error handling, and why instead everything is columnar and heavyweight (with DAGs and workflow orchestrators etc). Maybe I’m missing your point, but your Python code could definitely be as concise as any of the other examples you gave. reply",

          "text": "While I do like LLMs for these tasks, unfortunately this one failed you but was a near enough miss that you couldn't see it. What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

To be clear, I'm using it to become a better small game developer and not relying on it to answer anything I would classify as an \"important question\". Moreover, I don't take everything AI tells me to be 100% accurate (and I never copy/paste the response). Rather, I use it as an assistant with which I can have a back and forth \"conversation\" to acquire other perspectives. Despite a lot of effort, I'm just not a highly skilled developer and I don't have any friends / colleagues I can turn to for assistance (I don't know a single software developer or even another person who enjoys video games). While resources like StackOverflow are certainly useful, having answers tailored to my specific situation really accelerates progress. I'm not trying to cure cancer here and much of what would be considered the \"best approach\" for a small game architecture is unique to the developer. As such, AI is an incredible resource to lean on and get information tailored to my unique use case (here is my code...how does {topic} apply to my situation?\") And yes, I find errors from time to time, but that is good.

It's _similar_, though, because attention in LLMs basically looks for most similar tokens. So to answer the question about the term, the LLM had to create a stream of tokens that's semantically closest to the given description.

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

That may be a useful memory aide when learning. - The real website may have diagrams and other things that may not be available in your LLM tool of choice (grok). - The ACT of browsing to a different web page may help some learners better “compartmentalize” their new knowledge. The human brain works in funny ways. - i have 0 concerns of a hallucination when readings docs directly from the author/source. Unless they also jumped on the LLM bandwagon lol.

I examined a few months of previous posts and looked for descriptions people had written that stood out and looked good. I went back and looked at a previous month I had posted and noticed that post by me didn't stand out. I added a well written prompt about what I was looking in an organization and a role and I feel like that helped to give color to who I was compared to a giant list of technologies I'm capable of working with. I also received feedback from people who reached out that they went and read my personal website / blog; that gave them better insight into who I was. Don't underestimate the fact that soft skills and communication go a long way in the interview process and software engineering as a whole. Having a blog, which demonstrates the ability the communicate over a written medium, I feel is a great way help yourself stand out. It isn't a requirement to land a job, but I think it helps. reply",

          "text": "I'm in the job search right now but I wrote my own little tool to scrape linkedIn. It's a simple automation which searches through 10 pages of job postings and stores the results in a log file. This alone is helpful because it helps me avoid getting distracted by all the non-job related aspects of linkedIn; click-bait headlines, cringe posters etc. In addition it also filters out jobs that it has seen before. I found that the exact same job can be posted again with a different ID so I use a hash of the job description as the ID. I also have filters for certain words like \"7+\" which I assume means 7+ years of experience which I don't have. It's not perfect but it works well enough. I hate reading a job posting which looks decent only to find hidden near the end that they want someone with over a decade of experience. After a few days of using this tool consistently, I'll reach a saturation point which means that after going through the first 10 pages it will not find any new job. That's not a bad thing. That's actually the goal. It means that when an actual new job is posted, my tool will help me see it through all the clutter. The saturation point gives me a goal to reach every day. Instead of some arbitrary goal like sending out 10 applications or spending 1 hour every day, my goal is always to keep going until I reach the saturation point. This encourages me to be consistent and gives me a reasonable stopping point. reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have seen a few examples of this. Every case is a little different, but from what you've described I'd focus on salvaging the co-founder relationship. Conflict like this is totally normal. IMO, a pivot is when you change directions based on new information. It sounds like you're not pivoting, but lost. If you haven't already, addressing this head-on and having a candid conversation about being lost would be beneficial. Think of it as an exercise to possibly strengthen your relationship via conflict. Few other thoughts: 1. At this early stage of the business, the core asset is really the co-founding team and their relationship. Conflict is very much normal, but how you resolve it is important. You should be able to articulate your co-founder's concerns. For ex. she might feel the pressure to show \"progress\" to your investors. 2. It takes a lot of time and energy to build a good working relationship. Moving onto something else might seem like a good idea at the moment, but you could be right back with the same issue with another co-founder. 3. If you do decide to move on, end the relationship as amicably as you can. Note that this is not necessarily the \"quickest\" route, but it'll help keep your reputation intact. Edit: spelling. reply",

It's also possible that over the next two years, either he or his coworker could damage their relationships with investors. Typically, messy blow-ups reflect far worse on founders than politely stepping away. It often goes better to simply say something like, \"Hey, I'm sorry, but I don't think we're aligned anymore. This startup probably works best with just one captain at the helm, so for that reason, I'm out.\" Most importantly, even if sticking around for another year or two meant the difference between guaranteed funding and none at all, I'd still choose the extra year or two over the funding. Founders usually earn half—or even a third—of what they would make elsewhere. That extra time essentially translates to a couple of years of self-funded startup runway, and I'd much rather have that flexibility than guaranteed funding with strings attached. reply",

          "text": "Some additional personal observations that OP might find useful: - Building a company is really emotional, as you already know. Most founders are under-skilled when they start, and are forced to learn quickly. As a result, you get a lot of scars along the way and the experience will test all of your insecurities. Learning how to resolve existential crises again and again is part of the package. And it gets worse. Wait until you have whole teams of smart opinionated people that you have to lead. - It'll be good to revisit why you and your co-founder decided to start a company. You've both spent 2 years of your lives living in the trenches, so to speak. Someone decided you two were worth the risk. Why didn't your co-founder quit after the first idea failed? Why does she keep trying? I obviously don't have enough info to make any judgement calls, but I've seen situations where people make the wrong call because they've failed to truly appreciate the emotional baggage. For example, sometimes the first failure hits really hard and triggers all sorts of insecurities in a co-founder about not being good enough. And if their team starts questioning their judgement over and over without diffusing the insecurities, it just makes things worse. - There are good and bad breakups. Good breakups are worth it for the emotional closure and the reputational upside. Bad breakups can create all sorts of fallout that will affect you in unexpected way (sometimes without you even knowing, ex. if the drama resurfaces during due-diligence). All the legal mechanics are also much smoother and drama-free when the breakup is on good terms. - I am probably biased because these types of co-founder blowups are what keep investors up at night. Losing a technical co-founder is not only emotionally draining, but usually lethal for the investment. People problems are gnarly and take a lot of skill and precision to diffuse. If anything, use the crisis as a personal challenge to figure out how to resolve it on good terms. reply",

          "text": "At the risk of an unpopular view, and the inevitable downvotes, I think it's worth stating the following; If your business model is raising money from VCs then doing things VCs want is important to getting paid. All businesses tailor their output to suit their customer. Your customer is VCs. So you need to tailor your output accordingly. In this sense your business partner is not wrong. There's no point on working on things that excite you, if it doesn't excite them. That's a hobby. Sure, pivoting too often is also wrong. So you should try to improve that. At this point it's probably worth sitting down with your partner with the fundamental understanding she is right; You need to find something to attract the next investor. However you need to stick with it, success or fail. You've thrown a lot against the wall, now it's time to choose. Of course you'll likely fail. Most businesses do. VC based businesses at an even higher rate because your customer base is so small. But even failure is OK because VCs are looking for founders, not successes. Make no mistake; founding a startup is hard work. Not fun stuff. Not interesting stuff. Mostly it's just work. Being a founder isn't about coding. It's about business. You need to bring more to the table than just coding. Just like your co-founder takes an interest in the technical side, so you need to take more than a passing interest in the business side. In any business, sales is the most important thing. Without them you will fail. Tech supports sales, not the other way around. I'm sorry that this sounds harsh. I don't mean it that way. I wish you success. That success starts with you realizing the truth at the heart of your partners position. Start there. Fix your relationship. Good luck! reply",

I’ve seen this archetype before—a business person with just enough technical knowledge to chime in on complex product decisions, but without the patience or interest to develop any real depth. Instead of building real understanding, they rely on mimicking what looks successful. Always chasing whatever has funding or buzz. That kind of thinking lacks vision and makes it really hard to build anything meaningful. Over time, it wears you down. Even if the product “works,” it doesn’t feel good because you know you're forcing it. These folks tend to say things like “this should be easy,” then only show up to question why something isn’t done. They manufacture urgency instead of clarity, and when things inevitably fall short, the blame falls on the technical team. Second, you’re not a first-time founder anymore. Life’s short. For me at least, you’ve earned the right to walk away and build something you actually care about again. reply",

I think it's clear because it sounds like the two of you have a fundamental disagreement about how to choose a direction. There's also a power imbalance if you've consistently been going along with pivots that you don't want to execute on. If you think you can resolve things, then maybe I'm wrong. I'm basing my advice on the fact that this is 24 months in — enough time for you to know how easy it'd be to get back to \"we like working together and are on a path to success.\" Now for the hard parts:\n* You want to act as professionally as possible in walking away. Communicate clearly, being fair to both yourself and the other people involved. I think it's easy to err to far on either side (either too defensive/passive \"nice to yourself\" or too deferential \"nice to others\").\n* It can be tempting to think of this is as your cofounder's fault, but that's not constructive, and it's better to learn toward your future actions. For example, how could you have seen this problem earlier? My guess is that you were never \"cofounder compatible,\" and this is a chance to get better at identifying that compatibility with others (useful for both startups and other jobs). It's not a fun situation, and I hope things go well for you. reply",

In both cases our original business idea didn't work out, and we were trying to stay alive. It felt like pivoting from idea to idea. Reality was it was just trying to sell and collect enough to make payroll in six weeks. So we went from whatever we were doing to custom dev shop... Survival mode sucks.

It was that the business could execute well enough (without cofounders fighting and second guessing) so it could survive, and eventually find something to productize. reply",

If your heart is not 100% in it (for whatever reason) I'd suggest walking away. The opportunity cost of dragging the dead weight of a business that you're not bought into (and that you aren't seeing success with) is simply too high - and can have real life consequences (finances, stresses, etc). There's nothing wrong with walking away - there's a reason the overwhelming majority of startups fail. And most tiny startups fail due to co-founder relationships - doesn't have anything to do with PMF or anything. Think about it over a weekend - have the tough conversation(s) - don't burn the bridge.

It's not like this is an iron rule, but it's something you should be thinking about. If the only things in common between your new direction and your old one is your cofounder and some of your tech stack, you should have a good reason to keep the investors on, right? reply",

          "text": "Mr Stuck, I went through this and have strong feelings about it. I think the most important answer is to a question you aren't asking. *How to predict market demand for a new product.* It sounds like neither you or your co-founder know how to do this, and that's the problem. I don't have enough context to understand if the differences between you and your co-founder are unreconcilable, if they are, then maybe the answer is to move on, but if you mostly get along but are just struggling with an extremely uncomfortable and challenging situation, then here are some things to consider... First off, learn about Nonviolent Communication. If both you and your co-founder are willing to adopt it, that should help you improve your collaboration. Next, you probably need to cut your burn down to near-zero if you haven't already. Even if you have a decent amount of cash, if you and your co-founder still have enough control to make this decision, lay off everyone that isn't essential to servicing existing customers. If you have no customers, then cut everyone. Cut down to the smallest possible burn you can, to give you the most possible runway. Then, address your complete lack of market research skills, either by committing wholeheartedly to learning how to do it yourselves, or by finding a third co-founder who is really good at it. What you need is someone who has a decent grasp of technology trends and value-overhang, and who is very good at doing market research interviews (customer discovery interviews), and thinking through lenses like Jobs to be Done Theory, Outcome Driven Innovation and Design Thinking. When I say market research I don't mean some proctor and gamble quant nerd, I mean a scrappy startup bloodhound. Not all \"business people\" are built the same, and it would be good for you to ramp up the resolution of your evaluations of people in these roles. Then you need to come together to pick a group of people to focus on for AT LEAST 3 months. These need to be people you can access and talk to many of, and people who you have good reason to believe are all doing or trying to do very similar things. Read more about jobs to be done theory if you don't know what I mean. Here are some examples: (Startup founders, insurance brokers, nurses, teachers, parents raising two or more toddlers, robotics engineers, etc. - PICK ONE). Ideally you want to pick people who have money to spend themselves, have some authority or influence over how some money is spent, or whose work is important enough that making them more productive would be exciting to people who have influence. For example, elementary school teachers are probably not as attractive as a market as university professors, and private school elementary teachers are probably better than public school. If your founder is sensitive about engaging in this process without certainty that you will find an opportunity that's big enough to justify the VC investment, then consider focusing on a group of people like described above with high economic leverage (e.g. fintech CEOs, data-center architects, etc.) ~ focus on a set of people doing similar things close to where the money is flowing fast. Once you pick the group of people, you need to resist the urge to come up with any product ideas. Your next step isn't to ideate or innovate or whatever, its to go and empathize with the people. Get really fucking curious about what the people actually care about. Find a way to not want them to have specific wants. Read this again: Set yourself up to be curious about these people's actual wants, while not wanting them to have certain wants. It's way more fun to talk to people this way, you won't have the tension of \"I hope they validate our idea\", and they will enjoy talking to you because it will feel like therapy to them if you do it right. Ask things like \"What's the most important thing to you that you are the least satisfied with?\", and \"What else?\", \"if you could wave a magic wand...?\", ask follow up questions, \"has anything changed about that recently? Is it getting worse? How does it work today? Why does it work that way? How important is that step?, etc.\", make sure you understand all their answers. Listen actively. Stay curious. Empathize. Consider reading The Mom Test. You will be better off paying the targeted interviewees hundreds of dollars to spend an hour talking to you (2-3x their hourly salary), than spending that money on employees helping you flail around. If you can get their time for free, great! Once you start targeting a specific problem, it makes more sense to not pay for their time, since the chance of solving the problem can become the new motivation for speaking with you. After you have talked to ~30 or so people like this, you are fairly likely to spot an opportunity (You have also started to develop a very valuable skill). What you are looking for is something that a decent segment (e.g. 30%+) of the sample consider the most important thing they are trying to get done that they are the least satisfied with, or at least in the top 3, and that you think you can make a huge impact on with some emerging tech. Whatever you do needs to genuinely seem 10x better from the customers perspective, because the new benefit has to be worth the risk of spending time and money on something unproven / doesn't exist yet. The best opportunities will come from when you can re-frame the problems they are struggling with and understand them better than any one of the people you interviewed, because you got some unique perspective from talking to many people. Just don't rush this, because it has to be grounded in the reality of their existing values. After you gain the insight and have designed a new approach that you are highly confident at least a handful of the people will be excited about, go back to them and validate it. Ask the hard and scary questions (now with all that validation tension again), that they can and will pay money for it, or fight hard to get other people to pay for it, etc. If you did everything right up to this point, at least a handful of people will start pulling the product out of you. When you reach this point, at least 90% of the problems you described will be gone and you will have new (slightly better) problems. This is startups. <3 If you can't bring yourself to do something at least close to what I described above, then you're probably better off moving on, since the odds of succeeding from your current situation by pure luck is near-zero. That said, I encourage you to take the courageous and responsible path if you have it in you, the world needs more of it, and you will grow a lot from it. Sincerely,\nFloorEgg reply",

You use SPA when you have a private b2b client app, like a CRM or file manager for a particular user or organization, whose data and pages will never be publicly available or indexed. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a noob and has no idea what they’re doing and should be ignored because they’re chasing hype or optimizing something dumb. We live in a lazy load world you don’t need to load 25mb of JS. If you’re doing a private client side application look into lazy loading JS so you load only what’s necessary and load more as needed.

          "text": "My 2 cents The SSR game is peak frontend fashion. The players in this space sell hosting solutions and getting you onto their platform and spending money is their primary goal (i.e. increasing the amount of server side compute and ancillary \"services\" needed to deliver a frontend solution). Regardless even if you go SSR the backend elements should just be used for SSR, and potentially things like auth, but otherwise just go with a data API as normal that provides the SSR backend with data. Rule of thumb, the SSR solution should never be considered \"backend\" even if it is running on a server and not the client. SSR means it is way more difficult to open the network tab in developer tools and understand how your frontend is driving your API. I don't think I fully appreciated looking at the JSON sent over the wire in this tab until I did some SSR work. If you go with SSR expect ridiculous churn in your technology space. In the end I have latched onto vanilla React (e.g. no framework like Next) SPA that lazy loads components so you don't have a huge download on the first page load. I use wouter for routing and am pretty much trying to minimize all other deps where possible. I've gone with Preact but am questioning that a little now since it feels like I'm going off-road a bit on my simple setup. I'm no expert on the frontend but thought I'd share my experience walking down this same path over the last 3 months or so. Edit: how ironic that I'm calling React \"my simple setup\"... reply",

You should be able to articulate the pros and cons of choosing an SPA, SSR, SSG, or some combination of the above based on your user needs and team resources and constraints and the purpose of the app. Most of the app can be statically built, first rendered on the server and then cached on a CDN as static files. Then certain rerenders and calls can be clientside and others can go through the server if needed. It shouldn't just be a fashion choice, but a measured analysis. Like what is on your backend and what is on the edge, how would consistency work, what are the regional considerations, etc. I feel like asking which infra to build without knowing the app is putting the cart before the horse.

          "text": "I supervised a few students doing senior research projects back when I\nused to be a faculty member. I think a senior project is a different\nsituation than a master's or Ph.D. thesis because it's more about\ndemonstrating your employability than making original contributions to\nknowledge, and your time is very limited. To that end, it's important\nthat you finish up with something to show for yourself. Unless you\nplan to go into academia, working code counts for more with employers\nthan a research paper in itself. A null result even when properly\ninvestigated and analyzed is less impressive than a success, so a good\nway to hedge your bets is to find two or three competing technologies\naddressing the same need, implement a small similar project using each\nof them, and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. That way\nyou improve your chances of a successful outcome even if not all of\nthem work out, while also demonstrating a broader variety of skills to\npotential employers than you would if you focused on just one thing.\nRead enough of the literature to avoid embarrassing yourself but not\nto become a world class expert because the latter would waste your\nwhole year. Be careful of faculty members drawing you down a rabbit\nhole. They like thinking about cutting edge research problems, some of\nwhich might be of industrial interest, but even so, no company is\ngoing to put somebody fresh out of school in charge of that regardless\nof how smart that person seems to be. reply",

          "text": "I'll share what worked for me. I did a masters thesis on computational fluid dynamics. Go to google scholar and find the 'seminal' works in your field, for example say you want to know about aerodynamics, basically every course starts with Anderson's textbook, it has almost 10k citations. Find the books and papers with tonnes of citations. Those are likely the top books and top people in the field. Also look for literature reviews and if you search for universities and do 'filetype:pdf' in google, you can find lecture notes and reading lists. Those are all good starting points. As soon as you know what your topic is, start making it a habit to read research papers, take notes in the margins, highlight stuff. Read papers every week. I was lucky to have a long train ride where I had no phone service for a solid 60mins per day, so I read papers on the train almost every day. At this point you should know who the key people are and what they are interested in, in your field and topic. For my topic I figured out there are like 20 key researchers in the field, find the ones who are regularly publishing still (last 10 years or so) and read all of their stuff. You should be forming the 'lay of the land' now and finding patterns in where the gaps are, what future work and next steps are the researchers writing about. Work with your supervisor to discuss what you learned and narrow down the topic. So that is the INPUT part of the process covered. Let's talk about the OUTPUT next. When I was putting my thesis together, I really didn't want to have to write it all at the end or in the last few months. So my method was to imagine each chapter or so, was a paper of it's own, that built on each other. As you read you should be putting your literature review together anyway which could be a whole chapter of a thesis. Then the other pieces - introduction,  proofs, calculations, experimental design, testing, results, conclusion. If you start writing bits of it as soon as you get your topic you'll have lots of writing done by the time it comes to publishing, and the challenge is more about editing it down and making it cohesive. Obviously you kind of do the work then write the results, and from there form your intro and abstract to review what you did, and the conclusions to discuss next steps and how to build on your research. This approach scales from a single paper to a book, and it's mostly about being curious of the current state of the art in your field, building a habit for reading other papers, and figuring out where the gaps could be. As an undergrad, you're not really expected to contribute new science, so it's fine to pick an existing method and paper and only change a little bit of it, your supervisor will have a better idea of where the bar is set on this point, and what you're expected to accomplish. reply",

          "text": "I'm a professor at an undergraduate college. I've supervised honors thesis projects and published papers and posters with students. You've got two main options for doing research as an undergrad: 1. Join an existing research group as an assistant. This is more likely at a big university that emphasizes scholarship and publications. If you take this route, you'll probably have a small part of a larger project and your direct supervisor might be a postdoc or grad student. 2. Work on a complete project, either as an independent study or as an honors-level thesis. This is more common at an undergrad college like mine. The advantage of (1) is that you'll be exposed to a higher level of research and get a better feel for what grad school is like. The advantage of (2) is that you get to take on the entire research project, including the lit review and writing. In either case, the professor's research focus will play a big role in the topic of the project. The best advisor is one that you have a good relationship with and who has experience incorporating undergrads into their work. Prioritize that more so than the specific research topic. Think carefully about the scope of the project; a focused project within the supervisor's area of expertise is more likely to succeed. Trying to make up your own topic is probably a bad idea. I have a few practical tips from previous thesis projects I've supervised: - If you're doing a senior project, remember that you only have ~8 months, which has to include all the pre-research and writing. You need to be making progress every week. If you get stuck, seek help so you can get unstuck as quickly as possible. - Schedule time for your research every day like a class. That time is blocked off and you WILL NOT schedule anything else during it. Work in brief, regular sessions. Don't binge. - Keep backups of all your work, notes, and drafts. - You may have to do a lit review, but don't get bogged down on it. I frequently see issues with students who try to read \"every\" paper and lose time that would be better spent on their actual research. You should have 2-3 key papers (ideally identified by your professor) that you work through in detail. You may add other papers, but focus your reading on quickly extracting key points and the context of the paper -- this is an important research skill to develop early. Set an aggressive limit on the size and scope of the lit review so you can finish it and move on to other topics. - Be careful about projects that require hardware or complex system setups. You can easily lose a lot of time trying to get things to work. - You might be able to publish something, but don't get hung up on that as an outcome. Posters are a great result for an undergrad project. - The research question is the driver of the project. Make sure you clearly understand what you want to learn and how the design of your experiments/analysis relates to its answer. Some students fall into the trap of doing \"research\" that's more of a summary of an area, rather than an original investigation. Again, start with a narrow, carefully-scoped question; you can always broaden the scope if you have time. I wrote a document for my own students on the thesis research process, suggested timelines, and specific writing tips for the sections of the final paper: https://github.com/dansmyers/HonorsThesisGuide reply",
