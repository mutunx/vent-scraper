          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water.

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

Its autocomplete feels better at 'looking ahead' and figuring out what I might be doing next, while Windsurf tends to focus more on repeating whatever I've done recently. Also, while Windsurf has more project awareness, and it's better at integrating things across files, actually trying to get it to read enough context to do so intelligently is like pulling teeth. Presumably this is a resource-saving measure but it often ends up taking more tokens when it needs to be redone. Overall Cursor 'just works' better IME. They both have free trials though so there's little reason not to try both and make a decision yourself. Also, Windsurf's pricing is lower (and they have a generous free tier) so if you're on a tight budget it's a good option. reply",

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop.

Sometimes it just fails to submit code changes. Which is especially bad as they charge you for every request. Also I think they over-charge for Gemini, and Gemini integration is especially poor. My reference for agent mode is Claude Code. It's far from perfect, but it uses sub-tasks and summarization using smaller haiku model. That feels way more like a coherent solution compared to Cursor. Also Aider ain't bad when you're OK with more manual process. Windsurf: Have only used it briefly, but agent mode seems somewhat better thought out. For example, they present possible next steps as buttons. Some reviews say it's even more expensive than Cursor in agent mode. reply",

Also Gemini less neurotic when I use it with very basic prompts -- either Cursor prompts make it worse, or the need to juggle tool calls distract it from calls. reply",

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

          "text": "Since this topic is closely related to my new project, I’d love to hear your opinion on it. I’m thinking of building an AI IDE that helps engineers write production quality code quickly when working with AI. The core idea is to introduce a new kind of collaboration workflow. You start with the same kind of prompt, like “I want to build this feature...”, but instead of the model making changes right away, it proposes an architecture for what it plans to do, shown from a bird’s-eye view in the 2D canvas. You collaborate with the AI on this architecture to ensure everything is built the way you want. You’re setting up data flows, structure, and validation checks. Once you’re satisfied with the design, you hit play, and the model writes the code.

I forget almost everything I know about building software and instead focus on memorizing tricks and optimizations and processes for solving leetcode algorithm questions. In my last interview, in an automated screener, they had 7 leetcode easy+mediums in 10 minutes each, with zero partial credit, only final tests passing. That's what companies want now, so that's what I have to deliver - I don't have a fucking choice. I look over system designs, try to understand what the core aspect is. For the most part I tend to pass those without as much of a problem. Nothing works best, but doing this has gotten me further than actually practicing and writing code. I have 8 YoE, took a career break on short term disability for burnout/early childhood horrors that I needed to deal with. Its 2 years later, I'm able to code again and am picking up things much faster than ever, but I'm about to lose my apartment and move into a friends basement because a career break is, apparently, career suicide right now, and even contract companies won't even interview me because of the career break. I was getting cold recruited by FAANG before. I just want the opportunity to work so I can have stable housing, and I'm doing everything I can. It gets harder and harder to practice. I consider whether my career was a sham all along often. I don't really care that this is venting, there's nobody to talk to about it. reply",

I actually worked on a lot of the front-end functionality (among other things) during my tenure there and we had 1 person who was essentially the UX lead (I'm sure the team / function has expanded since then).\n>\n> The design philosophy for the website was heavily influence by Edward Tufte and myself and several folks from my engineering team were enrolled in his course to familiarize ourselves with key concepts.\n>\n> When I interviewed with McMaster-Carr I distinctly remember a Director who told me about building the first version of the website himself and not realizing it would become \"a real thing\" one day. I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he was a sharp guy and I'm sure he's off doing great things. We walked into work one Monday morning, and his desk was empty and his whiteboard said \"poof\".

For my McMaster example, google gives 9 results, none of which are the McMaster site. That not specific enough? To be fair, I believe McMaster to be fairly protective of their catalog. At least their part numbers are fairly recognizable - they are usually about 10 characters long, all numbers, with an \"A\" near the end.

On the other hand, if you train people that if you want to use McMaster part numbers, you have to use the McMaster site... once you have a customer, as long as your site and inventory don't frustrate them, you have a customer for life.

Google and Facebook are highly lucrative because they designed a system where your profit margins (as a business) are largely sucked up by Google and Facebook by making you bid against your competitors at higher and higher values until someone is willing to give up almost all of their margins to be the top bidder for the favored “top spot”. Hypothetically, if you make $1 in profit on your product, theory says that some competitor will bid up to $0.99 to secure that sale and if you don’t bid this amount also, your sales will suffer. The end result is that Google and Facebook end up consuming all the profits for a large number of businesses online that have to survive by advertising, which explains Google’s immense profit margins. Assuming what you say is true, this is truly a ballsy move by McMaster. Betting that their website is unassailable by their competition and thus such a value-add that they can forgo playing the losing game that Google and Facebook has setup is brilliant. I have such respect for that. reply",

The filter/apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster's auto updating window. Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense. Want to buy a generic \"graphing calculator\" for $126 which is definitely not a Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus? Here you go! [1]. Look, you're not fooling anybody here.

          "text": "It's ok most of the time, but it's not like they sell McMaster branded stuff in McMaster packaging. They are a supplier, and might want to obfuscate to keep you from buying direct from the actual manufacturers. On the other hand, on my desk right now is a bag of springs, the info printed on it says it was made by WB Jones, part number 4011. We ordered it from McMaster. Why not? They stock the item and ship super quick. If I want another bag of the same springs, it's not like I can go to McMaster, type in \"springs 4011\" and expect to find it. Instead, I'll have to search up purchasing requests I've made, maybe ask a coworker if they ordered them, etc. to find the mcmaster number again. If I didn't know Mcmaster sold it to us, I'd have no idea they sold it at all. To be fair, if they sell things that are interchangeable, like screws, it would be a lot to list every manufacturer they use. They have 5 locations, and probably stock from a different manufacturer or multiple manufacturers at each one. reply",

          "text": "Ardour has really good default settings. Another, maybe forgotten one is Wavosaur on Windows [1]. Great modularity, one can quickly remove cruft that's not needed, or add a lot of data on waveforms when necessary. I admit being a fan of the Classic Windows era UIs, though. :) A third, also forgotten one from the Win2k/9x GUI era is maybe Waveshop [2], also a great example of keeping things simple. Funny thing: I used Reaper for years (occasional pro-level radio production), then had to switch to Pro Tools because of studio demands. Afterwards tried going with Reaper again, but got really overwhelmed with all those endless possibilities for customization. So... I ended up using Ardour, which was easiest to grasp from day one. Really well thought out and polished GUI. Possibly a great example of why it makes sense to have a subscription/payment based, non-free open source project. Oh, and Audacity up to version 1.26 was also great. After 2.x, it started to add bloat IMO. I remember Eric S. Raymond highlighted it as a great example of modular, unix-y design in \"The Art of Unix Programming\" [3]. 1: https://www.wavosaur.com/ 2: https://victimofleisure.github.io/WaveShop/ 3: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s01.html#aud... reply",

          "text": "DAWs and audio plugins are a good example. Digital audio workstations can be somewhat varied in UI, but plugins can be vastly different from each other even for two of the same tools. Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical controls is challenging. Fabfilter has been a popular developer for years. Oeksound and Denise Audio are great examples too. Newfangled Audio makes good stuff and their limiter elevate handles multiple pages well. They all pack parameters into tight, cohesive UIs that look good and remain intuitive. Fabfilter often uses submenus that can feel convoluted, but they're arguably necessary given their plugin's depth. Denise Audio takes a different approach with standard, simple UIs across their product line. Everything is visible with no submenus, though they may offer fewer controls overall. Deciding what controls to expose and how to organize them intuitively presents a unique challenge. Multiple pages like how Newfangled does it works well. I don't find Fabfilter's submenus to be the best but that's often because they are unlabeled and use small, unique icons that are hard to grok. The overall UI for primary features is usually quite good though. reply",

I think through common problems with 4o, tough problems with o3, I copy all of Svelte's docs into 4o ( https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ ) to get good Svelte 5-focused feedback, I have 4o code-review what Cursor writes from time to time, I have 4o, sometimes o3, generate \"precise\" prompts that I'll give to Cursor when me talking off-the-cuff to Cursor doesn't get good results after a few attempts. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet so I might be misusing Cursor, or not making enough use of its rules system, or something. I feel like I get good value for my ChatGPT subscription. I don't feel like I get good value for my Cursor subscription, but I also still feel like keeping it because $20 to type a lot less is still pretty nice. I would be upset if I only had a Cursor subscription and no access to ChatGPT. I am pretty hesitant to pay for AI à la carte.

My take is that most people did not invest the little time necessary to get acustomed to its workflow. My advices for aider are: - familiarize yourself with the chat modes (architect, code, ask) - familiarize yourself with the edit modes (diff, whole, etc) and know which to use for a given model. Indeed not all models handle all modes equally well. - make the code one feature at a time, by small chunks if needed, by limiting the contxt to the relevant files. - practice to learn how to best phrase stuff. - write you coding preferences into aider convention files. Things like \"always use type hints, beartype for type checking, python click for the cli, add many comments\". I'm mainly doing python and with proper comments and type hints it's really easy for models to write code that works with the rest of the repo even with only a few files in its context. reply",

That said, I don't get why people are fine switching their IDE to cursor. Lile, if you're in an IDE it's because it has features you want that others didn't. So either cursor does not have them or if it does then you have to configure the whole cursor IDE to work like your original IDE. In total you've either lost features or been captured into a new walled garden. And lost some time in the process. Aider's use of litellm makes it 5s change to switch to the latest models. And it's always up to date thanks to uvx. No really I don't get why people are not using aider more. Plus the dev is lovely, responsive and helpful. reply",

          "text": "I settled on gptel, which is an LLM package for Emacs. It's kind of a mix of both approaches: 1. You have chats right there in the editor, easy to copy/paste and manage context/history without switching to a browser. You can also quickly add files or portions of files to the context or remove them again. 2. You can choose which model you want to use for what, granted you have an API key. 3. You can quickly highlight some code and ask for a change to it, which along with managed context is powerful. I tried auto complete again and again but it doesn't work for me. At first I think \"yeah, that's what I wanted to write\", and then I have to look closer to realise it's not, and that completely breaks my flow and concentration. I can always write some pseudo code and proactively convert it to real code, I like to be in the driver seat. Context management is really central to my workflow, I manage it like a hawk. Models tend to deteriorate as context content increases, in my experience, so I really try to keep it narrow. For that reason, and because our clients didn't sign up for their code to be sent to Anthropic et al, I _mostly_ use models like I would use StackOverflow, not to generate non-trivial code I'd actually use. But having the chats in my editor is really invaluable for me. Powerful text wrangling features make a difference in both speed and motivation. I use it pretty heavily with pretty much only the high-end models and pay about $15 per month. reply",

The \"context-in-the-codebase\" thing for AI-based IDEsis overrated IMO. To extract the most from it, you have to remember to @mention the files. If you don't remember to @mention specific files, the agent simply tries to perform searches (i.e., it has access to that tool) on the files and folders until it gets some results... and will usually keep broadening the search until it does. It works well enough I suppose. But I still find myself beginning new chats (for example, per feature) because the model still loses its place, and with all the code/lint fixes it does, it starts to lose context. Then you're right back having to @mention more files to ensure the model knows how to structure your front end, back end, etc. (Please excuse any misnamed development terms.) :-) reply",

Probably better than chat, since it could touch all css, html and JS that are sprinkled around in different files. But that's not my main job. Overall, I think my work is mainly \"deep\" problem solving. I don't necessarily produce much code per day. The chat is a helpful aid for thinking, copilot not as much. Another thing I've noticed is that writing the code myself has often a net longterm benefit. For a while I was generating all kinds of python scripts for converting data between formats etc. I'm not good with python, but LLMs are, so I just used that. Until I ran into a wall too many times. Eventually every \"temporary script\" kept growing until LLMs could no longer provide what I wanted, and then I was stuck. I would have to go through the whole code from start and internalize it fully to be able to get the thing done. I would have saved time doing it myself from the start. So now I mainly use the chat just to ask about available functions, syntax, etc, but rarely use the generated code. IDEs are not great for this kind of approach in my experience. reply",

The API is crazy expensive and painfully slow. It’s best for one-shot queries where you ask one thing and expect nearly identical results every time. Anything beyond that and it struggles. With ChatGPT Canvas I’ve completed small projects like WordPress plugins, handy personal Python scripts, chrome extensions (my favorite use of ChatGPT) and most importantly debugged faster than any tool I’ve ever used. Sure, my customer-facing GPT API apps are burning credits like a rocket on full throttle but at least I’m billing them for it. The API speed is wildly inconsistent so you can’t rely on it for everything. One key tip is you can’t keep a single chat going forever. It gets sluggish, especially when you paste long code blocks. My method is simple. I ask for the final clean code, then request a complete detailed summary of what we built and what the functions do. Then I start a fresh chat, paste the summary and code, and continue clean. Think of it like making a commit, just a very crude version. reply",

Occasionally, the windsurf command overlays (explain, accept, etc...) will get stuck and make it impossible to see the code until I restart VS Code. But the biggest problem that I have is with automatic auto-complete. With both Windsurf and copilot, I have trouble figuring out when / if an autocompleted function or line of code will be accepted or generated. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to integrate my coding style with the tools, but I'm still trying because the work has been impressive thus far. I'm now also trying the same with with Claude-code, which has been pretty useful too. It managed to figure out and explain a fairly technical code base (a few DNA processing algorithms). I haven't tried with with code I'm unfamiliar with yet. So, my verdict so far: well worth the effort to try it and learn what's available. It's not that expensive to try. If it can help automate somethings (documentation and tests, for example), that's what I'm really hoping to use the AI assistants for. It works for actual coding too, but I still prefer to provide the main foundation. reply",

          "text": "To answer your question directly \"it depends\". There are a lot of different subtasks to coding. Defining requirements, sketching/discussing architecture, coming up with a technical plan, executing it, creating tests, etc. Different interfaces are better at different things. Cursor/Windsurf agentic flows can be great at well defined tasks that are directly actionable within the abstractions of the existing codebase. If you want to build new things, you need to be a little more methodical, and this can mean using chat interfaces to have a dialogue with AI. I use RepoPrompt [0] + Cursor Tab Complete (since it's easily the best on the market), but I don't use the in-IDE cursor/windsurf agentic flows unless I have a small task I need doing where I can describe it perfectly. RepoPrompt is an underhyped context selection tool that includes - A prompt formatter so you can easily dump it + prompts into chat windows - A built-in diff format prompt template that gets auto-inserted so you can auto-apply the resulting changes. - A unique \"Chat\" mode that's an API frontend for multi-turn conversations with dynamic code context, templated prompting, etc. - An incredible \"delegate edit\" feature where the results of your conversation get sent to cheaper/smaller LLMs to actually enact. The cost savings and increase in coherency are unreal. It's not unusual for a single turn to generate something like 50 specific edits across a dozen files that are completely coherent. Right now my main workflow is to discuss architecture with a context dump + prompt to o3, settle on a solution, build a PRD, give that to 2.5 Pro to create a more granular plan, make edits, then send it back to 2.5 Pro to delegate edits to Flash 2.0/DeepSeekV3/o4-mini. Not unusal to see it produce 20-50 edits across a dozen files with perfect coherency. Any fixups or minor things I do in cursor. There are also the CLI agentic code tools. I find claude code to be like a more powerful version of the cursor agent flow. They're great for directed tasks that involve a lot of exploration, like understanding how you need to integrate with some submodule on the other side of the codebase.

I've written it off as unusable for coding, but can be fine for educational purposes - For AI IDE coding, I narrow down the scope of what I ask so Gemini 2.0 Flash or Haiku can handle it. I've haven't seen better results switching to paid models. - For generating large swaths of code, I recently went back to copy/pasting into Claude Projects, with my github project hooked up and relevant files added to context. For a moderately complex component, it usually takes 5-15 generated versions to work, though I end up adjusting my specs a bit in the process. This is still faster than using the agent. Claude Code might get similar results, but I already pay for Anthropic so haven't tried it out. - If I'm picking up a new library, concept, or pattern, I usually chat with Claude to level up my knowledge. The \"Plan\" mode in cline focuses more on task execution than skill development. I'm open to suggestions on what to try next! reply",

          "text": "I've gone through a few AI IDEs / agents and CLI tools now, currently on Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro which is doing a pretty good job at my web app code with a decent .clinerules file in the repo. To answer why I don't use chat at all for coding anymore, some benefits of IDE / CLI agents: Copy pasting into chat apps don't allow for agentic runs (ie run bash commands, edit code, validate with linting / testing before marking task as 'complete'). I can mostly just write my descriptive task (usually with code references if they aren't already there in clinerules / claude.md, etc.) and come back after a short walk or drinking some tea and check the code or just check at runtime to ask it to fix up the code. This is honestly very similar to \"waiting for code to compile.\" For reference, I've used the following to make production code changes: - Cursor: which when Claude 3.5 was out seemed to be the best AI IDE, but the changes they've made around agent mode and 3.7 haven't really worked super well for me. Migrated to claude code after 3.7 came out. - Claude Code: Very good, I generally just ran it in dangerous mode and it could accomplish tasks fairly well. Wrote a decent Claude.md file as well. Only con is that it got expensive quickly. On the order of $3-5 per session which would accomplish a single task. - Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Moved to it yesterday, it's been doing a good job and is effectively free right now using my own API key for Gemini. Seems a bit verbose at times although that might just be Cline's prompts. I haven't tried Aider or Windsurf, but have heard good things about Windsurf's agentic mode. Although I might not move to Windsurf at all since Cline with Gemini works pretty well & is free to use. reply",

It indexes your code and has a good idea how it goes together and where your code is.

So they are able to do a lot of quality work locally before involving the major LLMs. A year's subscription falls at about $16/month. I would say Cursor is the first real use of AI and it gives so much unfair advantage to those who use it.

You use slash commands to add whatever you need to the context (single files, directories, highlighted selections, etc) and interact with a conventional chat interface from there. The prompt library also lets you store convenient system prompts if you have a diverse task domain. You can of course use their new agentic features which can automate a lot of the context management via tool use, but I find that to be a waste of time and resources for the majority of tasks I care about.

I had to prompt it several more times to give me generic code with better typings. I think it would be helpful for a total nooblet to get a hang of the basics but I think if they rely on the LLM too much beyond a certain point they will face diminishing returns. Think about it. There is so much knowledge in the world. Anyone can do anything to a satisfactory degree pretty quickly. But to really understand something takes experience and self-discovery.

          "text": "In my opinion, the most useful way to use LLMs for learning (anything, but including programming) is to have it explain things in terms of what you are familiar with. You can give the model context of things you know are relevant that you do understand (or at least have a functional understanding of), and ask it to explain things that you don't yet understand, building on what you know. For example, asking things like \"I am familiar with object encapsulation and mutating state over time in object oriented programming. If pure functional programming does not allow for mutation, how to you manage the state of objects over time?\" or \"Help me learn about Kubernetes. I am familiar with using docker, docker compose, and virtual machines for deploying my applications.\" The problem is when you're learning something completely foreign like learning to program in your first language, you don't really have enough context to ask meaningful questions. In that case, it is simply better to do things like read manuals and bang your head against the problem. reply",

          "text": "They can be useful, though you have to use them carefully. For instance, one of the best ways I've found to learn a new language or framework or technique is to find a working example of something, then take it apart piece by piece to see how it all fits together. LLMs can work really well here. They can give you a super basic example of how something works, as well as an explanation you can use as a jumping off point for further research. And those basic examples can be surprisingly hard to find elsewhere. A lot of open source systems are designed for people with no programming knowledge whatsoever, and in a way that they can handle 52 million possible use cases with all the caveats that brings along. So when you're trying to learn from them, you end up having to untangle hundreds of conditions and feature flags and config options and other things designed for use cases you simply don't have. LLMs can provide a simple, customised example that avoids that. That said, you have to be willing to try things yourself, and put in the effort needed to figure out why the code the LLM returned does what it does, and how it works on a technical level. If you're just throwing problems at the tool and letting them do all the work (like many vibe coders now), you're not really learning anything. reply",

          "text": "From my personal experiences, working with small engineering teams and running an comp sci education program[1]. TL;DR: There are some benefits, but mostly not worth it or actively harmful for students/junior engineers. 1) Students using LLMs to code or getting answers generally learn much slower than those who do it old fashioned way (we call it \"natty coding\"). A very important of the learning experience is the effort to grok the problem/concept in your own mind, and finding resources to support/challenge your own thinking. Certainly an answer from a chatbot can be one of those resources, but empirically students tend to just accept the \"quickest\" answer and move on (bad habbit from schooling). But eventually it hurts them down the road, since their \"fuzzy\" understanding compounds over time. It's similar to the old copy-from-StackOverflow phenomenon, but on steroids. If the students are using these new tools as the new search, then they still need to learn to read from primary sources (ie. the code or at least the docs). 2) I think one of the problems right now is that we're very used to measure learning via productivity. Ie. the ability of a student to produce a thing is a measurement of their learning. The new generation of LLM assistants breaks this model of assessment. And I think a lot of students feel the need to get on the bandwagon because they produce very immediate benefits (like doing better on homework) while incurring long-term costs. What we're trying to do is to actually teach them about learning and education first, so they at least understand the tradeoffs they are making using these new AI tools. 3) Where we've found better uses for these new tools are in situations where the student/engineer understand that it's an adversarial relationship. Ie. there's a 20% chance of bullshit. This positioning puts the accountability in the human operators (can't say the AI \"told me so\") and also helps them train their critical analysis skills. But it's not how most tools are positioned/designed from a product perspective. Overall, we've mostly prohibited junior staff/students from using AI coding tools, and they need a sort of \"permit\" to use it in specific situations. They all have to disclose if they're using AI assistants. There are less restrictions on senior/more experienced engineers, but most of them are using LLMs less due to the uncertainties and complexities introduced. The \"fuzzy understanding\" problem seems to affect senior folks to a lesser degree, but it's still there and compounds over time. Personally, I've seen myself be more mindful of the effects of automation from these experiences. So much so that I've turned off things like auto-correct, spellcheck, etc. And it seems like the passing of the torch from senior to junior folks is really strained. I'm not sure how it'll play out. A senior engineer who can properly architect things objectively have less use for junior folks, from a productivity perspective, because they can prompt LLMs to do the manual code generation. Meanwhile, junior folks all have high powered footgun which can slow down their learning. So one is pulling up the ladder behind them, while the other is shooting their feet.

          "text": "I think job stability/security for the individual is highly dependent on the company rather than the size.  Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have had a history of laying off employees during downturns, while Apple has generally been better about avoiding this (this most recent economic downturn has been the first time Apple has done large layoffs in quite a long time IIRC). Layoffs are always possible no matter the company, so it's good to be prepared financially for that, however, you can look at a company's history to determine how you should react when the economy starts going down. For example, I grew up during the 2008 financial crisis.  I frequently heard my friends' parents getting laid off from the big tech companies.  Years later as I've reflected on this, I came to the realization that if I ever get into a big tech company like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, that I either need to make it to a position where I'm confident I won't be axed, or get out before I do.  And even if I'm confident that I won't get the boot, I should still plan for the possibility of that happening. reply",

          "text": "I guess that OP is referring to teams having this builettin-board style posts as a default. You post a post and others can react and comment. Which works like a mashup of old school forum and chat. It breaks chronology as newest updates are not on bottom or top. It was even called teams. So teams had a special use section called... teams. They recently changed the logic. Chats and teams are in the same place, but the rest is still a thing. I don't think there is a way to notify a chat. Like on slack or zoom or whatever. You can make a webhook to teams (ekhm, the post board thing), but not a chat. So you basically can't use Teams to make many small notifications because you just can't show them next to each other - it's always a big post. My favorite \"feature\" of teams is the missclicks. If you use it folded, when chat list (or teams list...) autohides, some parts of the list takes to the chat you want, but some...click the element that was beneath whatever you clicked. So you wanted to change a chat to some 1:1 with a friend, but you clicked some OneNote in a group chat. reply",

Sometimes in the daytime the radio signals bounce off the ionosphere, the noise level goes way up and local chatting range is reduced because stations from 600 miles to thousands of miles away are coming in. In the days when it was popular trolling assholes would jam and disrupt. people up on a hill with an illegal high power amplifier talked over people. In the 1970s and 1980s high power AM transmissions sometimes blasted out of the neighbors cheaply-made hifi or scrambled their TV picture. https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/green-blackboa... The eleven meter wavelength means you need a reasonably large antenna for good performance. These days it is local CB is almost dead in most places and the noise level is often high in towns due to every house having a dozen switch mode power supplies and other electronics, which really reduces the range. Decades ago, when it was popular, it was chaotic. Some CB radios did not receive well if someone nearby was talking within a few channels of you. Meet ups at pubs sometimes turned into fist fights. These days, in most of Europe and the UK you may sometimes hear the last few old men and crazy nitwits that still use CB radio but they are often far away and a legal 4watt radio does not get out far enough for anyone to hear you. reply",

Because your expectations from pigeon mail more or less align with reality. And you expect from a 21st century software some basic things like cross device synchronization or at least reliable messsge and status drlivery, but it fails you, sonetimes  in most important moments of your life.

          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

          "text": "I hit 40 this year. I have definitely noticed a slowdown even in the last few years. Before 30 I could pull 2-3 all-nighters a week without really feeling any ill effects. Then, maybe early-to-mid 30's I could only handle one per week, assuming I'd slept well otherwise. The sleep debt would be too high still and the next day I'd get headaches, feel extremely tired and unmotivated. Or I could sustain 2-4hrs of sleep a night for like 3-4 days, but again I'd pay for it if I didn't catch up (pretty sure I'm paying for it long-term anyways). Here at the end of my 30's I can't really do a full 40-hours straight without sleep anymore (16hr day, 8hr night, 16hr day, then sleep). If I don't get at least 2hrs overnight then that second day is mostly wasted, maybe I get 4hrs out of the 16. I've always known that sufficient sleep is important for your health, and I've tried to balance times of all-nighters with crashes to catch-up, but the allure of using the night as uninterrupted focus time is so strong when you work in modern corporate \"open-plan\" environments where always-on Slack/Teams presence is expected during business hours. reply",

I think: - they've had this degree of fakeness for almost the entirety of their existence (as long as they've needed \"sponsorship\" / been 6+ figure events) - at its best, there also was a scene/subculture _surrounding_ hackathons that did care about building genuinely \"cool\" / \"impressive\" things, had an earnest interest in actually starting something longer term (there are some really successful founders that \"incubated\" in the hackathon scene). these folks frequented hackathons, and eventually moved on as the scene saturated with careerism / they \"grew up\" professionally reply",

Meatspace get-togethers focused on hacking, either for a specific project or for a clique, never used the term \"Hackathon\". At least in my circles. Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\". I think for one of them we managed to get a few thousand or something from someone's employer to cover some costs. But \"sponsorship\" would be a strong word.

They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice. I think it has always been like this. But if you really want to build something and there's a sponsor at the event you should ask them for lots of free credits or for some contact info in order to establish a longer-term sponsorship. reply",

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP). As far as we could tell, some video production team was tapped to hack together a video in 30 minutes, they threw our name on it, and shipped it. I don’t trust much after that. reply",

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

Teams nowadays just `git clone` some repo, put in some crappy logo and then say \"I made this\", and they mean it.

No idea what are the social cues that led them to this, but I would find that interesting to study. I don't think they're ill intentioned, I think they don't consider lying to be bad and it's some sort of way of going through life. Not long ago I was having dinner w/ some scammers (one of them is on the latest YC batch, btw) and this guy was telling everybody that you need to lie to get ahead, \"if you don't lie to your investors they will invest in someone else who is lying to them\". This guy was somewhere between milennial and zoomer by age, but with a mien and mind more akin to that of a zoomer (TikTok, etc...). Very vulgar individual. That's SOTA these days. reply",

          "text": "I haven't been to a hackathon in a long time, but the best ones I remember were explicitly about getting designers and developers to build something concrete but simple for a good cause. I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing. Have to say, both events (and I attended several of each) were exciting. . . they challenged me in a way I was unfortunately not used to (except in high school and college) and showed that others were actually interested and part of the solution. The major plus of the budget hackathons was that we got to see students (middle schoolers, IIRC) who were doing whatever it was they were doing and having a blast.

At the end there was a big presentation that anyone in the company could attend and each team would present what they came up with. Some of them eventually became products directly, or at least set the groundwork for future products.

I got into hackathons in the early 2010s when IoT was the hot new thing and saw the crowds change from hardcore technologists to mostly students and idea people. The fact is the same thing that what drew me in is what attracted them - opportunity and optimism. Sponsors expect ROI and once a technology is no longer experimental, the same tired projects tend to win because they are tried and true. I've been to a couple of good hackathons lately but they are more focused on vibe coding and tend to only run for 8-12 hours. These let you try out an idea or framework with little commitment but lack the depth of multi-day events. I've been attending an XR hackathon for almost a decade which still embodies the ethos, but it is a labor of love carried out by volunteers. These longer, challenging and intentional events can teach you more about teamwork and product in one weekend than a year of churning through tickets. reply",

My guess is that this idea might hold in general, anything that can be built really quickly tends not to be too impressive and all impressive things tend to take longer.\nI have gotten to a point where, if I see something impressive, I have this nagging feeling, Was this completed here? or were you working on this for a decent amount of time and just took this opportunity to showcase it? reply",

          "text": "Seeing some good comments and will add to the pile. IMO it's not a \"now\" thing. There's a natural ad-hoc, close proximity vibe that some gatherings have. They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

The hackathons I remember as a college student were different. They were much more free form. You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box. Getting the prize was fun, but a working artifact was much more satisfying. That’s why we did it. So, yes, it’s too commercial these days. reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

If the client was literally completely passive and had no other role in their task than hiring the firm for something that wasn't part of a larger effort thet were actively engaged in, then, sure, they would have nothing relevant to the task to sacrifice by being the agent coordinator, they'd just need to spend the time learning to be an agent coordinator, and then actually become an active full-time participant rather than completely passive -- but presumably they were passive because that's exactly the level of engagement they were willing to put in, or, at least, because they found that being more active in the task had some associated disutility. reply",

Imagine you are a trader and asked agents to build you a perfect trading system and they discuss every next buy/sell and take a call to execute the action. How do you know in the long term you are making money? What if they decided to cheat on you and started buying stocks which will definitely crash in 1 month, while showing you a progress of profit by day trading other stocks. Would you just let them do what they're doing? reply",

But I didn’t sell features. I asked what their clients hated most, then built a fix for that. One well-placed feature, and the doors swung open. Real users, real feedback—and we’re still building on that foundation. Then there’s my blog. A creative sandbox, no overlap with my day job. No built-in audience. No distribution. Still waiting on subscriber #1 (Mom, seriously—now would be a good time). Takeaways: Partner with someone who already has meaningful reach.\n\n    Solve a real, hair-on-fire problem.\n\n    Offer something free to earn early trust.\n\n    Knock on doors, pitch relentlessly, repeat. And hope the gods of luck are listening. As for the writing side—different beast. Slower burn, no roadmap, no shortcuts. Still wandering in the woods, but enjoying the walk.

One Zoom meeting later, we had the foundation of a partnership. Honestly, it could’ve been any event. Just show up, be sincere, and listen more than you pitch.

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud.

          "text": "Not ignorant at all. I'm not sure if they’ve added any monetization features over the years. Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

          "text": "Might be fortunate instead: they're setting up to be able to train AI on specifically you and then, if needed, make music AS you undercutting you. Such is the way of things these days. I dropped Soundcloud paid version too, and migrated to just YouTube. Currently YouTube is trying very hard to learn to reply to my fans AS me, but through pushing buttons to immediately supply AI-generated responses. I'm sure anyone else with a substantial YouTube presence has seen this too. So far, they are not self-pressing the button and taking over replying to my fans for me, against my will. So far. They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible. Regarding OP, and in the light of what I've said, maybe ask yourself in what way you can disambiguate yourself from any random AI-powered startup in targeting what for the other startup will be an arbitrary or shotgun selection of customer targets. Is there an audience you can work specifically for, and is there a way you can signal to that audience that you're particularly aware of them and interested in working for them? reply",

          "text": "Of course. Most of the AI cases (that turn out to be an actual success) focus around a few repeatable patterns and a limited use of \"AI\". Here are a few interesting ones: (1) Data extraction. E.g. extracting specs of electronic components from data-sheets (it was applied to address a USA market with 300M per year size). Or parsing back Purchase Order specs from PDFs in fragmented and under-digitized EU construction market. Just a modern VLM and a couple of prompts under the hood. (2) French company saved up to 10k EUR per month on translators for their niche content (they do a lot of organic content, translating it to 5 major languages). Switched from human translators to LLM-driven translation process (like DeepL but understanding the nuances of their business thanks to the domain vocabulary they through in the context). Just one prompt under the hood. (3) Lead Generation for the manufacturing equipment - scanning a stream of newly registered companies in EU and automatically identifying companies that would actually be interested in hearing more about specific types of equipment. Just a pipeline with ~3-4 prompts and a web search under the hood. (4) Finding compliance gaps in the internal documents for the EU fintech (DORA/Safeguarding/Outsourcing etc). This one is a bit tricky, but still boils down to careful document parsing with subsequent graph traversal and reasoning. NB: There also are tons of chatbots, customer support automation or generic enterprise RAG systems. But I don't work much with such kinds of projects, since they have higher risks and lower RoI. reply",

People that were genuinely interested to learn more about the topic - opened my profile and followed the links there. This and interesting content was enough to grow community organically to 14k subscribers over 2 years. Another approach to speed up the growth - organise some fun event that benefits the entire community, highlights and showcases the participants. E.g. when I organised last Enterprise RAG challenge, we got 350 submissions from the teams around the world. Plus IBM joined as a sponsor. People were mostly participating not for the prises, but because of the approachable challenge and ability to push state of the art. Plus some were hired away because of the good leaderboard scores. Article of the winner (just google \"Ilya Rice: How I Won the Enterprise RAG Challenge\") is considered by some companies as one of the best resources on building document-based AI systems. And the entire community sees it as the result of their work together - further reinforcing the spirit of the collaboration. People tend to share and spread fruits of their labor and love. reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

Obviously, our product is very different from yours, but one thing that worked well for us was focusing on building momentum within small communities first rather than trying to appeal to everyone immediately. Tight-knit groups tend to generate stronger early engagement, which can give you the traction (and feedback) you need to grow. Another thing we learned: making it dead simple for users to share made a big difference. Even small friction points kill word-of-mouth, so optimizing for effortless sharing really amplified our reach. In your case remove as much friction as possible whatever that is. reply",

          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases. There are other exciting workflows, but I should really post a video on that. You could do anything with unix philosophy! reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water. It understands what I want to do next about 95% of the time when I'm in the middle of something, including comprehensive multi-line/multi-file changes.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

So far, I’ve only tried it on vibe coding game development, where every model I’ve tested struggles. It says “I rewrote X to be more robust and fixed the bug you mentioned,” yet the bug still remains. I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass.

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI.

If you can do things at 2x the speed, you can charge 1.5x and clients will be very happy. And if things are done faster, you can layer on more quality things as well – tests, features, fancy backgrounds and animations, optimizations for low end devices, and so on. People are often afraid that being too productive will make them run out of work. But with software, here's an endless amount of things to do. One of the more valuable things a contractor can do is help a profitable company with tech debt transition out of the tech debt. Eventually they become productive and take on tech debt because there's value to releasing new products as early as possible, and it's an endless cycle. reply",

But here’s something I’ve noticed:\nPeople who can calmly use AI to solve real, small, human problems — those people are still rare. You already have solid engineering experience. If you combine that with one thing you like solving — like automating reports, or filtering client messages — that’s a strong start. You don’t have to be flashy. You just have to be trustworthy.

All I can find after a bunch of keyword + date-restricted searches in Google, Quora, & HN is Ibrahim Bashir ( https://www.quora.com/Who-designed-UI-UX-and-developed-the-w... ) who worked there 2003-2005 ( https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-work-for-McMaster-Carr... ) and who writes: > McMaster-Carr has a Systems department which handles internal software development, including the website. I actually worked on a lot of the front-end functionality (among other things) during my tenure there and we had 1 person who was essentially the UX lead (I'm sure the team / function has expanded since then).\n>\n> The design philosophy for the website was heavily influence by Edward Tufte and myself and several folks from my engineering team were enrolled in his course to familiarize ourselves with key concepts.\n>\n> When I interviewed with McMaster-Carr I distinctly remember a Director who told me about building the first version of the website himself and not realizing it would become \"a real thing\" one day. I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he was a sharp guy and I'm sure he's off doing great things. We walked into work one Monday morning, and his desk was empty and his whiteboard said \"poof\". Given the timing and his description of what he did, it seems unlikely any other McMaster-Carr insider would have been writing about it, and this has to be what you are remembering, if anything. (And https://iacollaborative.com/work/mcmaster-carr/ seems useless here.) reply",

          "text": "This… is brilliant. Google and Facebook are highly lucrative because they designed a system where your profit margins (as a business) are largely sucked up by Google and Facebook by making you bid against your competitors at higher and higher values until someone is willing to give up almost all of their margins to be the top bidder for the favored “top spot”. Hypothetically, if you make $1 in profit on your product, theory says that some competitor will bid up to $0.99 to secure that sale and if you don’t bid this amount also, your sales will suffer. The end result is that Google and Facebook end up consuming all the profits for a large number of businesses online that have to survive by advertising, which explains Google’s immense profit margins. Assuming what you say is true, this is truly a ballsy move by McMaster. Betting that their website is unassailable by their competition and thus such a value-add that they can forgo playing the losing game that Google and Facebook has setup is brilliant. I have such respect for that. reply",

The filter/apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster's auto updating window. Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense.

They are a supplier, and might want to obfuscate to keep you from buying direct from the actual manufacturers. On the other hand, on my desk right now is a bag of springs, the info printed on it says it was made by WB Jones, part number 4011. We ordered it from McMaster. Why not? They stock the item and ship super quick. If I want another bag of the same springs, it's not like I can go to McMaster, type in \"springs 4011\" and expect to find it. Instead, I'll have to search up purchasing requests I've made, maybe ask a coworker if they ordered them, etc. to find the mcmaster number again. If I didn't know Mcmaster sold it to us, I'd have no idea they sold it at all. To be fair, if they sell things that are interchangeable, like screws, it would be a lot to list every manufacturer they use. They have 5 locations, and probably stock from a different manufacturer or multiple manufacturers at each one. reply",

Browsers can enable very rich and responsive interfaces, but web development is bogged down by the insane state of popular frontend stacks.

          "text": "Ardour has really good default settings. Another, maybe forgotten one is Wavosaur on Windows [1]. Great modularity, one can quickly remove cruft that's not needed, or add a lot of data on waveforms when necessary. I admit being a fan of the Classic Windows era UIs, though. :) A third, also forgotten one from the Win2k/9x GUI era is maybe Waveshop [2], also a great example of keeping things simple. Funny thing: I used Reaper for years (occasional pro-level radio production), then had to switch to Pro Tools because of studio demands. Afterwards tried going with Reaper again, but got really overwhelmed with all those endless possibilities for customization. So... I ended up using Ardour, which was easiest to grasp from day one. Really well thought out and polished GUI. Possibly a great example of why it makes sense to have a subscription/payment based, non-free open source project. Oh, and Audacity up to version 1.26 was also great. After 2.x, it started to add bloat IMO. I remember Eric S. Raymond highlighted it as a great example of modular, unix-y design in \"The Art of Unix Programming\" [3]. 1: https://www.wavosaur.com/ 2: https://victimofleisure.github.io/WaveShop/ 3: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s01.html#aud... reply",

          "text": "DAWs and audio plugins are a good example. Digital audio workstations can be somewhat varied in UI, but plugins can be vastly different from each other even for two of the same tools. Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical controls is challenging. Fabfilter has been a popular developer for years. Oeksound and Denise Audio are great examples too. Newfangled Audio makes good stuff and their limiter elevate handles multiple pages well. They all pack parameters into tight, cohesive UIs that look good and remain intuitive. Fabfilter often uses submenus that can feel convoluted, but they're arguably necessary given their plugin's depth. Denise Audio takes a different approach with standard, simple UIs across their product line. Everything is visible with no submenus, though they may offer fewer controls overall. Deciding what controls to expose and how to organize them intuitively presents a unique challenge. Multiple pages like how Newfangled does it works well. I don't find Fabfilter's submenus to be the best but that's often because they are unlabeled and use small, unique icons that are hard to grok. The overall UI for primary features is usually quite good though. reply",

The good news is that there are a bunch of other jobs still left. And for a long time yet there are still lots of IT jobs that are safe. To be fair, low-skill programming jobs have been replaced for years. Lots of them outsourced offshore. (Does it matter if your job goes to AI or a Bengali?). But today's systems are huge, and complex, and require a lot more than what AI can do (impressive as that is.)

It's somewhat like a jerk genie and I feel like I'm writing a contract rather than working with an assistant. Claude 3.5 doesn't have this problem. Gemini 2.5 Pro will one shot complex instructions and even read between the lines. The drawback is that it can often overthink as well. One example was I want to deselect a dropdown if I recreate it (e.g. select state when changing countries). The ideal solution is to just check this on the view layer. Gemini 2.5 pro is terrible at this - it'll go down into lower layers and overengineer, when the solution should just to set as null if the new dropdown doesn't contain the same text. GPT 4.1 has been quite good lately, but it's not quite as agentic and it will ask you a lot of questions and request confirmation to begin. It is perfect for workflows where you aren't certain yourself. GPT is also smartest from the visual angle, able to read color variations well and designs them well. Claude is the worst visually. reply",

This might be too pricey, so you could then go for a Surfans F20 like already recommended ( https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/AIGOErosQK ). It has no balanced output, but is about 120 bucks and supports Rockbox. If you more into Android and streaming, you could take a look at the Hiby M300 which is also a budget device, but has a pretty modern Android and is a bit more portable than a smartphone. Maybe it's also worth mentioning Qobuz ( https://www.qobuz.com/ ), the high res music streaming service. Many audiophiles are into this, while I'm not using streaming services at all. I personally use an old iPod Nano 7g and as backup device my Android phone with Substreamer / DSub and self hosted navidrome. Not hi-res, I don't need this :-) reply",

Cursor seems kind of \"dumb\" compared to 4o, but it's a good workhorse. I let Cursor handle the basics - basically acting as a glorified multi-file autocomplete. I think through common problems with 4o, tough problems with o3, I copy all of Svelte's docs into 4o ( https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ ) to get good Svelte 5-focused feedback, I have 4o code-review what Cursor writes from time to time, I have 4o, sometimes o3, generate \"precise\" prompts that I'll give to Cursor when me talking off-the-cuff to Cursor doesn't get good results after a few attempts. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet so I might be misusing Cursor, or not making enough use of its rules system, or something. I feel like I get good value for my ChatGPT subscription. I don't feel like I get good value for my Cursor subscription, but I also still feel like keeping it because $20 to type a lot less is still pretty nice. I would be upset if I only had a Cursor subscription and no access to ChatGPT. I am pretty hesitant to pay for AI à la carte. I feel much better about working within the limitations of a known subscription cost. reply",

          "text": "I'm SO surprised to not see aider-chat everywhere mentionned. I've been using it for about a year and it's incredible. My take is that most people did not invest the little time necessary to get acustomed to its workflow. My advices for aider are: - familiarize yourself with the chat modes (architect, code, ask) - familiarize yourself with the edit modes (diff, whole, etc) and know which to use for a given model. Indeed not all models handle all modes equally well. - make the code one feature at a time, by small chunks if needed, by limiting the contxt to the relevant files. - practice to learn how to best phrase stuff. - write you coding preferences into aider convention files. Things like \"always use type hints, beartype for type checking, python click for the cli, add many comments\". I'm mainly doing python and with proper comments and type hints it's really easy for models to write code that works with the rest of the repo even with only a few files in its context. reply",

So either cursor does not have them or if it does then you have to configure the whole cursor IDE to work like your original IDE. In total you've either lost features or been captured into a new walled garden. And lost some time in the process. Aider's use of litellm makes it 5s change to switch to the latest models.

          "text": "I settled on gptel, which is an LLM package for Emacs. It's kind of a mix of both approaches: 1. You have chats right there in the editor, easy to copy/paste and manage context/history without switching to a browser. You can also quickly add files or portions of files to the context or remove them again. 2. You can choose which model you want to use for what, granted you have an API key. 3. You can quickly highlight some code and ask for a change to it, which along with managed context is powerful. I tried auto complete again and again but it doesn't work for me. At first I think \"yeah, that's what I wanted to write\", and then I have to look closer to realise it's not, and that completely breaks my flow and concentration. I can always write some pseudo code and proactively convert it to real code, I like to be in the driver seat. Context management is really central to my workflow, I manage it like a hawk. Models tend to deteriorate as context content increases, in my experience, so I really try to keep it narrow. For that reason, and because our clients didn't sign up for their code to be sent to Anthropic et al, I _mostly_ use models like I would use StackOverflow, not to generate non-trivial code I'd actually use. But having the chats in my editor is really invaluable for me. Powerful text wrangling features make a difference in both speed and motivation. I use it pretty heavily with pretty much only the high-end models and pay about $15 per month. reply",

The \"context-in-the-codebase\" thing for AI-based IDEsis overrated IMO. To extract the most from it, you have to remember to @mention the files. If you don't remember to @mention specific files, the agent simply tries to perform searches (i.e., it has access to that tool) on the files and folders until it gets some results... and will usually keep broadening the search until it does. It works well enough I suppose. But I still find myself beginning new chats (for example, per feature) because the model still loses its place, and with all the code/lint fixes it does, it starts to lose context. Then you're right back having to @mention more files to ensure the model knows how to structure your front end, back end, etc. (Please excuse any misnamed development terms.) :-) reply",

Probably better than chat, since it could touch all css, html and JS that are sprinkled around in different files. But that's not my main job. Overall, I think my work is mainly \"deep\" problem solving. I don't necessarily produce much code per day. The chat is a helpful aid for thinking, copilot not as much. Another thing I've noticed is that writing the code myself has often a net longterm benefit. For a while I was generating all kinds of python scripts for converting data between formats etc. I'm not good with python, but LLMs are, so I just used that. Until I ran into a wall too many times. Eventually every \"temporary script\" kept growing until LLMs could no longer provide what I wanted, and then I was stuck. I would have to go through the whole code from start and internalize it fully to be able to get the thing done. I would have saved time doing it myself from the start. So now I mainly use the chat just to ask about available functions, syntax, etc, but rarely use the generated code. IDEs are not great for this kind of approach in my experience. reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple apps just for myself using the API and honestly it sucked. The chat remembers context and talks to you like a real conversation. The API is crazy expensive and painfully slow. It’s best for one-shot queries where you ask one thing and expect nearly identical results every time. Anything beyond that and it struggles. With ChatGPT Canvas I’ve completed small projects like WordPress plugins, handy personal Python scripts, chrome extensions (my favorite use of ChatGPT) and most importantly debugged faster than any tool I’ve ever used. Sure, my customer-facing GPT API apps are burning credits like a rocket on full throttle but at least I’m billing them for it. The API speed is wildly inconsistent so you can’t rely on it for everything. One key tip is you can’t keep a single chat going forever. It gets sluggish, especially when you paste long code blocks. My method is simple. I ask for the final clean code, then request a complete detailed summary of what we built and what the functions do. Then I start a fresh chat, paste the summary and code, and continue clean. Think of it like making a commit, just a very crude version. reply",

Occasionally, the windsurf command overlays (explain, accept, etc...) will get stuck and make it impossible to see the code until I restart VS Code. But the biggest problem that I have is with automatic auto-complete. With both Windsurf and copilot, I have trouble figuring out when / if an autocompleted function or line of code will be accepted or generated. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to integrate my coding style with the tools, but I'm still trying because the work has been impressive thus far. I'm now also trying the same with with Claude-code, which has been pretty useful too. It managed to figure out and explain a fairly technical code base (a few DNA processing algorithms). I haven't tried with with code I'm unfamiliar with yet. So, my verdict so far: well worth the effort to try it and learn what's available. It's not that expensive to try. If it can help automate somethings (documentation and tests, for example), that's what I'm really hoping to use the AI assistants for. It works for actual coding too, but I still prefer to provide the main foundation. reply",

          "text": "To answer your question directly \"it depends\". There are a lot of different subtasks to coding. Defining requirements, sketching/discussing architecture, coming up with a technical plan, executing it, creating tests, etc. Different interfaces are better at different things. Cursor/Windsurf agentic flows can be great at well defined tasks that are directly actionable within the abstractions of the existing codebase. If you want to build new things, you need to be a little more methodical, and this can mean using chat interfaces to have a dialogue with AI. I use RepoPrompt [0] + Cursor Tab Complete (since it's easily the best on the market), but I don't use the in-IDE cursor/windsurf agentic flows unless I have a small task I need doing where I can describe it perfectly. RepoPrompt is an underhyped context selection tool that includes - A prompt formatter so you can easily dump it + prompts into chat windows - A built-in diff format prompt template that gets auto-inserted so you can auto-apply the resulting changes. - A unique \"Chat\" mode that's an API frontend for multi-turn conversations with dynamic code context, templated prompting, etc. - An incredible \"delegate edit\" feature where the results of your conversation get sent to cheaper/smaller LLMs to actually enact. The cost savings and increase in coherency are unreal. It's not unusual for a single turn to generate something like 50 specific edits across a dozen files that are completely coherent. Right now my main workflow is to discuss architecture with a context dump + prompt to o3, settle on a solution, build a PRD, give that to 2.5 Pro to create a more granular plan, make edits, then send it back to 2.5 Pro to delegate edits to Flash 2.0/DeepSeekV3/o4-mini. Not unusal to see it produce 20-50 edits across a dozen files with perfect coherency. Any fixups or minor things I do in cursor. There are also the CLI agentic code tools. I find claude code to be like a more powerful version of the cursor agent flow. They're great for directed tasks that involve a lot of exploration, like understanding how you need to integrate with some submodule on the other side of the codebase.

I've haven't seen better results switching to paid models. - For generating large swaths of code, I recently went back to copy/pasting into Claude Projects, with my github project hooked up and relevant files added to context. For a moderately complex component, it usually takes 5-15 generated versions to work, though I end up adjusting my specs a bit in the process. This is still faster than using the agent. Claude Code might get similar results, but I already pay for Anthropic so haven't tried it out. - If I'm picking up a new library, concept, or pattern, I usually chat with Claude to level up my knowledge.

To answer why I don't use chat at all for coding anymore, some benefits of IDE / CLI agents: Copy pasting into chat apps don't allow for agentic runs (ie run bash commands, edit code, validate with linting / testing before marking task as 'complete'). I can mostly just write my descriptive task (usually with code references if they aren't already there in clinerules / claude.md, etc.) and come back after a short walk or drinking some tea and check the code or just check at runtime to ask it to fix up the code. This is honestly very similar to \"waiting for code to compile.\" For reference, I've used the following to make production code changes: - Cursor: which when Claude 3.5 was out seemed to be the best AI IDE, but the changes they've made around agent mode and 3.7 haven't really worked super well for me. Migrated to claude code after 3.7 came out. - Claude Code: Very good, I generally just ran it in dangerous mode and it could accomplish tasks fairly well. Wrote a decent Claude.md file as well. Only con is that it got expensive quickly. On the order of $3-5 per session which would accomplish a single task. - Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Moved to it yesterday, it's been doing a good job and is effectively free right now using my own API key for Gemini. Seems a bit verbose at times although that might just be Cline's prompts. I haven't tried Aider or Windsurf, but have heard good things about Windsurf's agentic mode. Although I might not move to Windsurf at all since Cline with Gemini works pretty well & is free to use. reply",

You get quality + speed/stability + low price, there's just little reason to paste anything into websites anymore, and no reason to go back to Copilot. reply",

          "text": "Zed strikes a good balance I think with their non-agentic text threads feature. You use slash commands to add whatever you need to the context (single files, directories, highlighted selections, etc) and interact with a conventional chat interface from there. The prompt library also lets you store convenient system prompts if you have a diverse task domain. You can of course use their new agentic features which can automate a lot of the context management via tool use, but I find that to be a waste of time and resources for the majority of tasks I care about. I currently manage my own fork to use a custom FIM completion provider I built, that tends to do most of the heavy lifting for me in terms of anything AI-generated. reply",

I forget almost everything I know about building software and instead focus on memorizing tricks and optimizations and processes for solving leetcode algorithm questions.

That's what companies want now, so that's what I have to deliver - I don't have a fucking choice. I look over system designs, try to understand what the core aspect is. For the most part I tend to pass those without as much of a problem. Nothing works best, but doing this has gotten me further than actually practicing and writing code. I have 8 YoE, took a career break on short term disability for burnout/early childhood horrors that I needed to deal with. Its 2 years later, I'm able to code again and am picking up things much faster than ever, but I'm about to lose my apartment and move into a friends basement because a career break is, apparently, career suicide right now, and even contract companies won't even interview me because of the career break. I was getting cold recruited by FAANG before. I just want the opportunity to work so I can have stable housing, and I'm doing everything I can. It gets harder and harder to practice. I consider whether my career was a sham all along often. I don't really care that this is venting, there's nobody to talk to about it. reply",

And for a lot of us, it's not just about prep - it's dealing with burnout, gaps, and the mental load that comes with the whole process. A few of you mentioned mock interviews and practicing tricky questions. That's actually something I've been working on, a tool called HirePrep ( https://hireprep.app ) that generates interview questions based on your resume + the job you're applying for. It's meant to make prep feel less generic and more like the real thing. Anyway, thanks again to everyone who contributed. This thread's been weirdly comforting. reply",

          "text": "Always. Every interview exists to narrow down the applicant pool. Unless it's an automated interview, I would rather stay unemployed than take one of those. The prep depends on the interview type. Most fall into 3 categories. 1. Algorithms - I remember a better time in life when I had the luxury to wait until I had an interview scheduled and only then would I have the motivation to grind. I'm now grinding everyday since it takes time to make meaningful improvements. Although a part of me enjoys these type of questions, it does make me question my career choice. I guess the one silver lining is that I'm getting much better at solving these questions than when I was employed. 2. System design - For this type of interview I've found that it's all about your ability to guess what type of system they'll want you to build and what parts they'll be interested in focusing on. 3. Behavioural - This actually requires the most company specific preparation. Refining your behavioural stories to match what the company is looking for and with who you're interviewing with (i.e Recruiter or C-suite level). Thinking of meaningful questions to ask. Practicing mock interviews. It all takes time. reply",

          "text": "I have a list of technical questions I tend to stumble over. Things like SSL pinning, cache management, CI/CD, github stuff, and DI. Often things that colleagues have set up 3 years ago and are now just a function call on Slack. Every interview will ask the same questions: \"Tell me something about yourself. Why would you leave such an awesome job? Are you willing to take a pay cut for equity? Why do we need you instead of paying a junior and giving them AI? How do you practice Agile in your workplace? How would you train a junior? How much are you being paid now? How do you feel about trans people and dogs?\" Some of these are traps. The only wrong answer is sounding defensive or evasive. So it's important to practice taking these head on. I find that if you nail the first interview with the decision maker(s), you will get the job. You can fail the interview but they'll even give you another one because they see it as some kind of error. If you excel at the technical interview and don't pass the vibe check, they'll find a reason to reject you. Then they'll pick at the number of past jobs you held (too many or too few), resume gaps, 'culture fit', etc. And if they absolutely find nothing to reject you for, you'll get rejected for being overqualified. Also it's important to interview for the role you're applying for, not the one you hold. For me, it's a shift – founding engineer/staff+/TL/EM/CTO at this point. The IC roles aren't being evaluated from an IC angle. They're being evaluated from an angle of whether I can lead product next year once the company has raised $100m. They don't know anything about you. They don't know that I used to spend my teenage years as a kind of PM making games with strangers over the internet. The unwritten question I have to answer by the end of the interviews is, \"Can this engineering degree nerd from a developing Muslim majority country lead a team of white people who went to MIT?\" reply",

Or some variation of traveling salesman. Optimization skill matters no matter where you work, but mostly in the sense that you're not applying O(2^n) unnecessarily. Multiple interviews are really based on funnel size, and funnel size is based around expectations and whether the company can afford full-time recruiters. If you're paying say, $1500/month for a junior here like Accenture does, the funnel will be full and you can drag people through multiple rounds. Many will just prefer to pay $800 and grab the first applicant that passes. reply",

I don't think this is good general advice, especially for positions where you're still primarily hands on code, but has worked quite well for me. It's also very helpful to not be applying via public HR processes. Warm intros to specific teams / leadership makes everything so much easier.

Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have had a history of laying off employees during downturns, while Apple has generally been better about avoiding this (this most recent economic downturn has been the first time Apple has done large layoffs in quite a long time IIRC). Layoffs are always possible no matter the company, so it's good to be prepared financially for that, however, you can look at a company's history to determine how you should react when the economy starts going down. For example, I grew up during the 2008 financial crisis.  I frequently heard my friends' parents getting laid off from the big tech companies.  Years later as I've reflected on this, I came to the realization that if I ever get into a big tech company like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, that I either need to make it to a position where I'm confident I won't be axed, or get out before I do.  And even if I'm confident that I won't get the boot, I should still plan for the possibility of that happening. reply",

Start by defining an Ideal Customer Profile and be very specific (for examples, Facebook started with Harvard students in certain social circle).  A good way to know how to be specific is by using a framework to define your ICP, like this you know if you are collecting the right information or not 2. Once you define your ICP, depending on the framework you are using will have mapped where they usually \"hang out\" online and offline -> At the beginning prioritse offline more than online. You are doing things that don't scale. 3. Having that information, you then design a way to get in front of them. If you are going the \"online\" route, then it can be Paid Ads, it can be social media DMs, etc... I only recommend the only route once you know you have the right messaging tested by talking with users that became paying customers. As a final note: try to get as many users that fit the same ICP as possible at the beginning, you'll want to seem a big fish in a small pond. reply",

Thus low barrier of entry * It seems unlikely anyone can win over existing customers based on undercutting your price. * 1% of revenue of a business sector can make up a nice indie business. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible.

We sent them to various regions across Germany, but my guess is they ended up in a pile at the campground reception and never reached the actual owners. That said, we manually scraped around 500 campgrounds near us, designed postcards that highlighted CloudCamping’s key selling points, and sent them out using a different mailing service. Since we didn’t hear back from anyone specifically mentioning the postcards, I assume they didn’t convince anyone in the end. Still, it was a fun experiment, and who knows, it might work better in a different context! reply",

This template is boilerplate for the last 3 or 4 I’ve seen. Then it gets posted to hacker news to solicit feedback from “real users”. Without fail the creators happen to haha stumble in and happily take your feedback. Absolutely nothing changes and you will return to the same product page as an old bookmark 2 years from now and realize nothing on the page has changed. Instead, notice when this happens and then take away your own experience and use it to build your own product. Good luck! reply",

I've specifically mentioned Discord because there's no easy way to discover communities without being invited, so if you can actually discover relevant Discord communities and monitor discussions (beyond the few sites that aggregate some popular communities), then you have a USP, since most products don't do that, at least in any capacity that people think is worth paying for. reply",

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around.

I keep track of tasks and to do lists for me and people in my team (using #people/name tags). I have specific updates notes for each project. I add a weekly header (via a template) in reverse chronological order. Pull the key updates into that (I also have a todo for each project that pulls in tasks from all files in that project subfolder - so picks up meeting actions) I also put them all in a canvas so when I doing updates about projects they’re all in one place. I do the same for people I manage so I can keep track of updates and todos when I’m meeting with them. My go to start point is a daily not where I throw in new tasks (tagged to projects or people) and those get pulled into the corresponding project/person file. Because it’s markdown with lots of plugins it helps me do things like diagrams (mermaid diagrams) etc and excalidraw/canvas for architecting/mind map style ideation. reply",

          "text": "Currently I use Obsidian to make note of a few key things, but what I'm more excited about is that the way tech is evolving is going to allow us much more expansive solutions for personal knowledge-bases. Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

Coding has always been 10% coding and 90% debugging but I think the rate at which we generate the 10% will grow exponentially. This means that the debugging has to grow. We will generate errors at an unprecedented rate. LLMs trained on previous errors and methods won’t catch them. They’ll be more complicated and spread out over the code. We need new tools to visualize the code and track errors. I think what it means to be a programmer will change. More testing, thinking and less klocs. reply",

          "text": "> a lot of work between where we are and where LLMs replace 4 Junior devs The projection from current SOTA is that coding LLMs replace 1 senior dev + 5 junior devs with 1 senior dev + LLM. Ergo, there will be fewer junior dev positions and senior dev salaries can capture some of the additional value they deliver. Whether that's offset by the increase in senior supply as junior -> senior conversions happen...? The two areas that will likely expand demand to absorb those junior devs are: (1) Integration engineering (i.e. poorly-documented interface to poorly-documented interface) (2) Testing (because if kloc are cheap, there will be more money to validate -- and it will make people feel safer to have human-in-the-loop before sign-off / production). Coding LLMs are always going to be better at things well-represented in their training sets. Which is to say, the most popular languages, API styles, apps as of todayish. So, other things will be the best use of human time. reply",

However, I don't really think you will see a massive drop-off in employment for two reasons.  First, competition is going away.  If your developers are x times more productive, so are your competitors developers.  I can see a bit less need in non-product companies if more domain experts are able to build their own tools, or generalized agentic tools eliminate some of the need for custom tooling. However, I think there is a second thing that is often overlooked here. It seems the angle is always 'oh companies can replace developers' but no one seems to consider that developers can replace companies.  I think you are going to see small teams of very skilled people replace able to make amazing products.  There are limits to what llm's can do on their own but a skilled engineer who masters the tooling and can unblock the models and knows the techniques to keep the models productive as the codebase grows will be able to produce amazing things far beyond what they could ever produce before.  I think you are going to see an explosion of new, smaller companies.  I think if you are an engineer you shouldn't be gloomy, you should be excited. reply",

You see this now with the \"Indians hiring Indians\" phenomenon. Trump put the brakes on that, so currently the only thing that's certain is uncertainty. My take is that there will be an attempt to replace at least the bottom end of outsourcing with LLMs, so more pressure on offshore labour to perform and, over time, fewer positions overall, as junior roles have already evaporated around here and eventually that will translate to fewer seniors. reply",

So I think there will be more software work in consultancy. I think we’ll see advancements in robotics and more hires there. And I think there will be more jobs around the LLM ecosystem — progress on foundational models, inference optimizations, on prem migrations, networks of agents, AI more deeply integrated with existing sw. Overall I think there will be more jobs in observability, security, and infrastructure. I agree there will be fewer junior positions.

          "text": "Gen Z and the generation afterwards, having had parts of their psychology destroyed by Tik Tok, ready access to AI for cheating school and such, will lack the attention span to properly learn time intensive skills such as coding and first principles engineering. Knowledge of complex maths and theorems will be lost and there will be generally no interest in things such as functional programming, proofs, math, etc. Initially there will be a huge employment downturn as organisations follow the pattern of hiring a Gen Y expert and supplementing them with Gen Z juniors using increasingly good AIs. After a while, the Gen Y seniors will retire and/or die and it will be impossible to source a senior developer with actual knowledge. Wages will skyrocket for a few Gen Z experts, but in general there will be a shortage and the entire industry will eventually reboot, although I am stuck to speculate how exactly. At some point, we will lose the ability to quickly make advancement in AI because engineers will stop understanding how they work due to a lack of deep understanding in mathematics etc. and advancement will drop by 100x or 1000x. Due to people becoming very lazy on average, capitalism will become ineffective and most governments will veer towards centralised services, or central planning/communism to cope with the lazy populous. A few people with work ethic approximate to today’s founder work ethic, or deep skills, will be worshipped. reply",

          "text": "We're on the cusp of an indie software boom. The reasons why exist in Taleb's antifragility thesis: the antifragile will gain from disorder. The nature of the tech industry, in the decades roughly since the Cold War ended(which put to rest a certain pattern of tech focused on the MIC and moved SV forward into its leadership position), has promoted fragility along several of Taleb's dimensions: it aims to scale, it aims to centralize, and it aims to intervene. The pinnacle achievement of this trend is probably the iPhone, a convergent do-everything device that promises to change your life. But it's axiomatic(in Taleb's view, which I will defer to since his arguments are good enough for me) that this won't last, and with talk of \"the end of the US empire\", and a broader pessimism in tech, there seems to be popular agreement that we are done with the scale narrative. AI is a last holdout for that narrative since it justifies further semiconductor investment, stokes national security fears of an \"AI race\" and so on - it appeals to forces with big pocketbooks, that are also big in scale, and also in a position of fragility themselves. But eventually they will tap out too, for the same reasons. Whether that's a \"next year\" thing or a \"twenty years\" thing is hard to predict - the fall of the USSR was similarly hard to predict. The things that are antifragile within software are too abstract to intentionally develop within a codebase, and are more a measure of philosophy and how one models the world with data - CollapseOS is at the extreme end of this, where the viewpoint is bacterial - \"all our computing infrastructure is doomed if it is not maintainable by solo operators\" - but there are intermediate points along it where the kinds of software that are needed are in that realm of a plugin to a large app or an extension to an existing framework, and development intentionally aims not to break outside that scope. That thesis agrees with the \"small niches\" view of things. Since we have succeeded in putting computers into every place we can think of, many of the things we need to do with them do already have a conventional \"way of doing it,\" but can exist in a standard and don't need to be formalized behind a platform and business model - and LLM stuff does actually have some role in serving that by being an 80% translator of intent, while a technical specialist has work in adding finish and polish. And that side of things agrees with going deeper into the stack. I believe one pressing issue that's faced with this transition is the inclination brought from the corporate dev environment to create a generalized admixture of higher and lower level coding - to do everything as a JS app with WASM bits that are \"rewritten in Rust\" - when what indie software needs is more Turbo Pascals, Hypercards, and Visual Basics, environments that are tuned to be complete within themselves and towards the kinds of apps being written, while being \"compatible enough\" to deploy to a variety of end-user systems. reply",

And who defines where technical skills start and end? Will AI development/innovation stop in the future? And if not, will the engineers working on AI not be applying technical skills? Will AI eliminate the technical skill of plumbing? Of doctors? What about systems analysis and architectural design, a technical skill. Will AI read the minds of people, anticipate their every tech need, and eliminate that too? Maybe some have a weird understanding of the \"technical\". Its meaning is much broader that they think. reply",

          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases. There are other exciting workflows, but I should really post a video on that. You could do anything with unix philosophy! reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

My understanding is that Aider itself is free, but you have to pay per token when using an API key for your LLM of choice. I can look up for myself the prices of the various LLMs, but it doesn't help much, since I have no intuition whatsoever about how many tokens I am likely to consume. The attraction of something like Zed or Cursor for me is that I just have a fixed monthly cost to worry about. I'd love to try Aider, as I suspect it suits my style of work better, but without having any idea how much it would cost me, I'm afraid of trying. reply",

Normally, I add the required files, change to architect or ask mode (depends on the problem I want to solve), explain what my problem is and how I want it to be solved. If the Aider answer satisfies me, I change to coding mode and allow the changes. No magic, I have no idea how a single prompt can generate $4.

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

So far, I’ve only tried it on vibe coding game development, where every model I’ve tested struggles. It says “I rewrote X to be more robust and fixed the bug you mentioned,” yet the bug still remains. I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass. Also, give Zed’s Edit Predictions a try. When refactoring, I often just keep hitting Tab to accept suggestions throughout the file. reply",

All the models use the old function signatures, but Claud Code then sees compile error and fixes it. Compared to Zed Agent, Claude Code is: \n- Better at editing files. Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI. I plan to test other tools when my Claude Code subscription expires next month. reply",

All I can find after a bunch of keyword + date-restricted searches in Google, Quora, & HN is Ibrahim Bashir ( https://www.quora.com/Who-designed-UI-UX-and-developed-the-w... ) who worked there 2003-2005 ( https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-work-for-McMaster-Carr... ) and who writes: > McMaster-Carr has a Systems department which handles internal software development, including the website. I actually worked on a lot of the front-end functionality (among other things) during my tenure there and we had 1 person who was essentially the UX lead (I'm sure the team / function has expanded since then).\n>\n> The design philosophy for the website was heavily influence by Edward Tufte and myself and several folks from my engineering team were enrolled in his course to familiarize ourselves with key concepts.\n>\n> When I interviewed with McMaster-Carr I distinctly remember a Director who told me about building the first version of the website himself and not realizing it would become \"a real thing\" one day. I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he was a sharp guy and I'm sure he's off doing great things. We walked into work one Monday morning, and his desk was empty and his whiteboard said \"poof\". Given the timing and his description of what he did, it seems unlikely any other McMaster-Carr insider would have been writing about it, and this has to be what you are remembering, if anything.

For my McMaster example, google gives 9 results, none of which are the McMaster site. That not specific enough? To be fair, I believe McMaster to be fairly protective of their catalog. At least their part numbers are fairly recognizable - they are usually about 10 characters long, all numbers, with an \"A\" near the end. That's usually enough to get me to check the McMaster site first. reply",

          "text": "This… is brilliant. Google and Facebook are highly lucrative because they designed a system where your profit margins (as a business) are largely sucked up by Google and Facebook by making you bid against your competitors at higher and higher values until someone is willing to give up almost all of their margins to be the top bidder for the favored “top spot”. Hypothetically, if you make $1 in profit on your product, theory says that some competitor will bid up to $0.99 to secure that sale and if you don’t bid this amount also, your sales will suffer. The end result is that Google and Facebook end up consuming all the profits for a large number of businesses online that have to survive by advertising, which explains Google’s immense profit margins. Assuming what you say is true, this is truly a ballsy move by McMaster. Betting that their website is unassailable by their competition and thus such a value-add that they can forgo playing the losing game that Google and Facebook has setup is brilliant. I have such respect for that. reply",

Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense. Want to buy a generic \"graphing calculator\" for $126 which is definitely not a Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus? Here you go! [1]. Look, you're not fooling anybody here.

They told me that the real reason there's usually no brand information is that they buy the same bolt (for example) from many different suppliers to guarantee availability. They will only put a brand on a product (example: 3M DP420) when it truly comes from a single source and has special meaning/implications. That said, I order tens of thousands of dollars of McMaster Carr items each year. They almost always come in packages from the OEM with OEM part numbers. So if I want more bolts like that, I just look at the box they were delivered in. The info is just not on the web interface. reply",

They are a supplier, and might want to obfuscate to keep you from buying direct from the actual manufacturers. On the other hand, on my desk right now is a bag of springs, the info printed on it says it was made by WB Jones, part number 4011. We ordered it from McMaster. Why not? They stock the item and ship super quick. If I want another bag of the same springs, it's not like I can go to McMaster, type in \"springs 4011\" and expect to find it. Instead, I'll have to search up purchasing requests I've made, maybe ask a coworker if they ordered them, etc. to find the mcmaster number again. If I didn't know Mcmaster sold it to us, I'd have no idea they sold it at all. To be fair, if they sell things that are interchangeable, like screws, it would be a lot to list every manufacturer they use. They have 5 locations, and probably stock from a different manufacturer or multiple manufacturers at each one. reply",

Then there's the larger overhead from relying on JavaScript for everything. The JS VM in modern browsers is very performant, but it can't optimize poorly written code, whether that's from frameworks, the gazillion libraries modern web sites depend on for analytics, trackers, ads, shims, helpers, etc., and, of course, any custom JS specifically written for the web site. Browsers can enable very rich and responsive interfaces, but web development is bogged down by the insane state of popular frontend stacks. There's a recent trend of rejecting this insanity (htmx, Nue, Datastar), which I hope gets us on a track where we optimize for user experience using native web technologies. reply",

          "text": "Ardour has really good default settings. Another, maybe forgotten one is Wavosaur on Windows [1]. Great modularity, one can quickly remove cruft that's not needed, or add a lot of data on waveforms when necessary. I admit being a fan of the Classic Windows era UIs, though. :) A third, also forgotten one from the Win2k/9x GUI era is maybe Waveshop [2], also a great example of keeping things simple. Funny thing: I used Reaper for years (occasional pro-level radio production), then had to switch to Pro Tools because of studio demands. Afterwards tried going with Reaper again, but got really overwhelmed with all those endless possibilities for customization. So... I ended up using Ardour, which was easiest to grasp from day one. Really well thought out and polished GUI. Possibly a great example of why it makes sense to have a subscription/payment based, non-free open source project. Oh, and Audacity up to version 1.26 was also great. After 2.x, it started to add bloat IMO. I remember Eric S. Raymond highlighted it as a great example of modular, unix-y design in \"The Art of Unix Programming\" [3]. 1: https://www.wavosaur.com/ 2: https://victimofleisure.github.io/WaveShop/ 3: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s01.html#aud... reply",

          "text": "DAWs and audio plugins are a good example. Digital audio workstations can be somewhat varied in UI, but plugins can be vastly different from each other even for two of the same tools. Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical controls is challenging. Fabfilter has been a popular developer for years. Oeksound and Denise Audio are great examples too. Newfangled Audio makes good stuff and their limiter elevate handles multiple pages well. They all pack parameters into tight, cohesive UIs that look good and remain intuitive. Fabfilter often uses submenus that can feel convoluted, but they're arguably necessary given their plugin's depth. Denise Audio takes a different approach with standard, simple UIs across their product line. Everything is visible with no submenus, though they may offer fewer controls overall. Deciding what controls to expose and how to organize them intuitively presents a unique challenge. Multiple pages like how Newfangled does it works well. I don't find Fabfilter's submenus to be the best but that's often because they are unlabeled and use small, unique icons that are hard to grok. The overall UI for primary features is usually quite good though. reply",

How would you change your response to the comment in one case or the other?  Both can lie, manipulate, tell half-truths, etc.  The only difference I can see is if you believe you can prevent a living person from making or continuing to make a big mistake by responding, then spend some time on the response.  If it’s a bot, you don’t.  You submit interesting relevant factoids regardless because the non-bots (TM all rights reserved) might like them. BTW, using stylistic features in writing to ID bots might be low-yield.  Style changes are trivial to implement in any automated system, and they can be used to stylistically “blackball” particular human contributors.  “I’ve heard that using ‘grey’ instead of ‘gray’ is a sure sign of a bot!”  That sort of thing. reply",

We didn't really care when it was factory workers, or payroll clerks, or switchboard operators. But now that it's going after programmers, now we care. The good news is that there are a bunch of other jobs still left. And for a long time yet there are still lots of IT jobs that are safe. To be fair, low-skill programming jobs have been replaced for years. Lots of them outsourced offshore. (Does it matter if your job goes to AI or a Bengali?). But today's systems are huge, and complex, and require a lot more than what AI can do (impressive as that is.)

As we approach AGI any person sharp with ai tools and self motivated and with domain knowledge will replace entire teams. I expect huge big tech layoffs. The problem lingers is that no matter if ai cant do your job, it can do the job of a hell lot of people, and if all that people are unemployed and in gigs eventually the economy will collapse, doesn't matter if you are a writer or a HVAC, and see robots if you are the last. The issue isn’t just job loss, but the velocity of change. Capitalism isn’t designed for near-instantaneous obsolescence. Government wont do shit because this is a gazillion dollar industry and also they are still figuring out what's the internet. Jobs wont be created at the same pace they are destroyed, and AI will be able to take on those roles too. Companies will follow what shopify and duolingo did. even the pope is concerned, hence its name. AI will disrupt ALL industries. hell, even ai art is objectively better and cheaper than human art.

          "text": "AI is hype.  It does do some things, but about 75-80% of the AI business value is based only on FOMO and not any kind of metric or economic factor.  So, unless there is some radical revolutionary improvement to AI just put that out of your mind. Now, it seems your concerns are anchored on employment and not anything regarding technology.  I have been laid off during my career and survived many layoffs.  The first round of layoffs I experienced in the big brand web world was the same year I received a negative review.  I kept my job while other highly rated people were pushed out the door. Here is my learning about career sustainability: * If you don't like what you do then all you are doing is funding a life style.  If you both hate what you do AND do not have a shit ton of personal disposable income sitting in a bank account after 5 years its not worth it.  Tell them to fuck off, take a hit to your income/lifestyle and do something else.  You will thank me later.  This one piece of advice will add years to your life. * If you want to have a job that withstands all layoffs (aside from the business completely folding) do what is most needed.  In my case I was a first year front end developer at Travelocity back in 2008 when the market crashed and before massive frameworks did your job for you.  They couldn't hire front end developers to save their life.  Its just like now in that most of the candidates were extremely childish or extremely incompetent, but now businesses looks the other way while colossal frameworks and tool sets do most of the work.  I kept my job when others didn't because I was more valuable to the business, even with a shit annual review, than people who were cherished employees. * If you want to be taken seriously on the job do only two things well: 1) guard your time and 2) take care of people.  Be ruthless about these two things.  If you spend 4 hours a week actually doing your job and the coworker next to you spends 40 hours a week doing their job you are 10x more valuable.  This is counter-intuitive because they are working hard you aren't doing shit.  Hard work is not valued.  Delivery is valued.  If you want hard work to be valued then get out of IT and becoming an independent contractor of a trade skill.  If you are a narcissist your more competent peers will see through your bullshit.  Seriously, learn to take care of people. * If you want to get promoted do only three things well: 1) deliver what your boss asks of you, 2) measure things, and 3) demonstrate superior communication and organizational skills.  I have seen this work in the corporate world and I have heard these exact things more than once from brigadier generals in the US Army. reply",

          "text": "> I have never felt like more of a replaceable cog in a machine. Since forever I remember reading in the news that company XYZ 'let go' # thousands of employees in countries A, B, and from departments C, D. I was working in a bank (one of the many) back in the late 00s and one morning the (open space) office was dead silent. It use to have 200+ people but that day it had 20+. Apparently \"Management\" saw something coming (it was the 2008 crisis) and decided to cut costs asap, and the first to go out were the ~200 contractors (back then there was no 'remote' work, so everyone was in the office). I knew one of them, we grew up in the same neighborhood, and he was super angry because they asked them to simply hand over their laptops and walk out. 1 minute notice,  and paid them in the end of the month for the rest of the month and that was that. At _that_ moment I realized that shit doesn't just happens to others on the news, it happens to all of us, it's not an IF it will happen to you/me/anyone, it is a WHEN it will happen. Brace yourselves, winter is coming. reply",

I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently.

          "text": "Fastmail these days with a custom domain. I was on protonmail for years. But I found the integrations were not compatible with my ideal workflow. Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

          "text": "Not ignorant at all. I'm not sure if they’ve added any monetization features over the years. Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

Such is the way of things these days. I dropped Soundcloud paid version too, and migrated to just YouTube. Currently YouTube is trying very hard to learn to reply to my fans AS me, but through pushing buttons to immediately supply AI-generated responses. I'm sure anyone else with a substantial YouTube presence has seen this too. So far, they are not self-pressing the button and taking over replying to my fans for me, against my will. So far. They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible. Regarding OP, and in the light of what I've said, maybe ask yourself in what way you can disambiguate yourself from any random AI-powered startup in targeting what for the other startup will be an arbitrary or shotgun selection of customer targets. Is there an audience you can work specifically for, and is there a way you can signal to that audience that you're particularly aware of them and interested in working for them? reply",

          "text": "Not sure if I'm allowed to link to stuff, but you can find a bunch of alternatives to offerings like these (the most basic being google alerts), both free and paid, if you look for them - especially on sites that exist to list alternatives. Some let you link accounts, some give you lists of platforms they scan. I've specifically mentioned Discord because there's no easy way to discover communities without being invited, so if you can actually discover relevant Discord communities and monitor discussions (beyond the few sites that aggregate some popular communities), then you have a USP, since most products don't do that, at least in any capacity that people think is worth paying for. reply",

          "text": "I also run a small B2C company ( https://pastmaps.com ). Here's what worked for me: First 1000 users: daily manually done reddit posts. Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

If you don't get any buys from 200 emails sent to your target market you probably don't have a business. Once I validate and start getting traction only then I start automating cold email, ads etc. Do not validate with automated cold email agency. You can't automate something well what aren't doing with success already manually. Nothing beats manually researching your prospects and writing up personalized email - only when you understand this process and you know how, where and when to find your ICP and what to look for and what to tell them only then you can automate this process. You want to automate processes that work already. Not the other way around. Built a few businesses with this approach and still works today in 2025. reply",

I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing.

          "text": "I think the decline of FILE_ID.DIZ files is largely a byproduct of changing distribution methods. Back in the BBS and early FTP days, these small text files were crucial because they provided a quick summary for file archives, especially when bandwidth was limited, and you couldn't afford to waste time downloading the wrong file. With the rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, project descriptions and metadata have become more integrated. The README.md has essentially replaced FILE_ID.DIZ as the default \"project descriptor\", but with much more flexibility for formatting, linking, and even embedding media. Additionally, the way we discover and share software has changed. We now have package managers, app stores, and automatic metadata parsing tools that handle much of what these files used to do. Plus, we expect modern software to have much more comprehensive documentation than a few lines in a .DIZ file. reply",

Ergo, there will be fewer junior dev positions and senior dev salaries can capture some of the additional value they deliver. Whether that's offset by the increase in senior supply as junior -> senior conversions happen...? The two areas that will likely expand demand to absorb those junior devs are: (1) Integration engineering (i.e. poorly-documented interface to poorly-documented interface) (2) Testing (because if kloc are cheap, there will be more money to validate -- and it will make people feel safer to have human-in-the-loop before sign-off / production). Coding LLMs are always going to be better at things well-represented in their training sets. Which is to say, the most popular languages, API styles, apps as of todayish. So, other things will be the best use of human time. reply",

I think another angle to think about this is Junior devs that can leverage AI to learn have a much shorter path to Senior than current Seniors had to take (aka the hard way). If as a Junior you know of things to look out for but don't know the implementation details, AI can help you. For really obscure issues or bugs, I had to scroll through seemingly random StackOverflow results (or Experts Exchange, ha) looking for exact issues that I had, weeding through answers that weren't relevant, things based on older versions, etc. Now you give the context to AI tech stack, data, and your source code, explain the problem with the error message, and ask what might be happening and that shaves a few hours off the old way of trial and error. Even if the 1st answer isn't totally right, a few follow on questions will help narrow it down. reply",

However, I don't really think you will see a massive drop-off in employment for two reasons.  First, competition is going away.  If your developers are x times more productive, so are your competitors developers.  I can see a bit less need in non-product companies if more domain experts are able to build their own tools, or generalized agentic tools eliminate some of the need for custom tooling. However, I think there is a second thing that is often overlooked here. It seems the angle is always 'oh companies can replace developers' but no one seems to consider that developers can replace companies.  I think you are going to see small teams of very skilled people replace able to make amazing products.  There are limits to what llm's can do on their own but a skilled engineer who masters the tooling and can unblock the models and knows the techniques to keep the models productive as the codebase grows will be able to produce amazing things far beyond what they could ever produce before.  I think you are going to see an explosion of new, smaller companies.  I think if you are an engineer you shouldn't be gloomy, you should be excited. reply",

Of course, either I'm totally wrong or people haven't yet really realized they can do this, as it's not happening on the level I'm predicting ... yet. reply",

You see this now with the \"Indians hiring Indians\" phenomenon. Trump put the brakes on that, so currently the only thing that's certain is uncertainty. My take is that there will be an attempt to replace at least the bottom end of outsourcing with LLMs, so more pressure on offshore labour to perform and, over time, fewer positions overall, as junior roles have already evaporated around here and eventually that will translate to fewer seniors. reply",

Knowledge of complex maths and theorems will be lost and there will be generally no interest in things such as functional programming, proofs, math, etc. Initially there will be a huge employment downturn as organisations follow the pattern of hiring a Gen Y expert and supplementing them with Gen Z juniors using increasingly good AIs. After a while, the Gen Y seniors will retire and/or die and it will be impossible to source a senior developer with actual knowledge. Wages will skyrocket for a few Gen Z experts, but in general there will be a shortage and the entire industry will eventually reboot, although I am stuck to speculate how exactly. At some point, we will lose the ability to quickly make advancement in AI because engineers will stop understanding how they work due to a lack of deep understanding in mathematics etc. and advancement will drop by 100x or 1000x. Due to people becoming very lazy on average, capitalism will become ineffective and most governments will veer towards centralised services, or central planning/communism to cope with the lazy populous.

          "text": "We're on the cusp of an indie software boom. The reasons why exist in Taleb's antifragility thesis: the antifragile will gain from disorder. The nature of the tech industry, in the decades roughly since the Cold War ended(which put to rest a certain pattern of tech focused on the MIC and moved SV forward into its leadership position), has promoted fragility along several of Taleb's dimensions: it aims to scale, it aims to centralize, and it aims to intervene. The pinnacle achievement of this trend is probably the iPhone, a convergent do-everything device that promises to change your life. But it's axiomatic(in Taleb's view, which I will defer to since his arguments are good enough for me) that this won't last, and with talk of \"the end of the US empire\", and a broader pessimism in tech, there seems to be popular agreement that we are done with the scale narrative. AI is a last holdout for that narrative since it justifies further semiconductor investment, stokes national security fears of an \"AI race\" and so on - it appeals to forces with big pocketbooks, that are also big in scale, and also in a position of fragility themselves. But eventually they will tap out too, for the same reasons. Whether that's a \"next year\" thing or a \"twenty years\" thing is hard to predict - the fall of the USSR was similarly hard to predict. The things that are antifragile within software are too abstract to intentionally develop within a codebase, and are more a measure of philosophy and how one models the world with data - CollapseOS is at the extreme end of this, where the viewpoint is bacterial - \"all our computing infrastructure is doomed if it is not maintainable by solo operators\" - but there are intermediate points along it where the kinds of software that are needed are in that realm of a plugin to a large app or an extension to an existing framework, and development intentionally aims not to break outside that scope. That thesis agrees with the \"small niches\" view of things. Since we have succeeded in putting computers into every place we can think of, many of the things we need to do with them do already have a conventional \"way of doing it,\" but can exist in a standard and don't need to be formalized behind a platform and business model - and LLM stuff does actually have some role in serving that by being an 80% translator of intent, while a technical specialist has work in adding finish and polish. And that side of things agrees with going deeper into the stack. I believe one pressing issue that's faced with this transition is the inclination brought from the corporate dev environment to create a generalized admixture of higher and lower level coding - to do everything as a JS app with WASM bits that are \"rewritten in Rust\" - when what indie software needs is more Turbo Pascals, Hypercards, and Visual Basics, environments that are tuned to be complete within themselves and towards the kinds of apps being written, while being \"compatible enough\" to deploy to a variety of end-user systems. reply",

Look at your own baseless statement. At least I qualified my statement with “it’s possible”. If LLMs solve the hallucination issue then it’s stuff like this that will sit at the top of the hierarchy. People who make grand claims with confidence and play politics to get to the top.

          "text": "For one thing a lot of tools like Excel do unwanted data transformations,  such as importing from a CSV they try to guess whether text is meant to be a string or a number and sometimes guess wrong.  You can spend a lot of time disabling this behavior or preventing it or fixing it up afterwards,  but frequently bad data just plain corrupts the analysis or target system. You can't really trust the time handling functions on any platform which is some  of the reason why languages like Python, and Java, might have two or three libraries for working with dates and times in the standard library because people realized the old one was unfixable.  Plenty of Javascript date handling libraries have told people \"look,  this is obsolete,  it's time to move on\" not just because that's the Javascript way,  but because the libraries really were error prone. In a real programming language it's straightforward to fix those problems,  in a fake programming language it is difficult or impossible. If you've got a strange index structure in the source or destination data, for instance, many tools fall down.  For instance if you want to convert nested set trees https://blog.uniauth.com/nested-set-model to something more normal like an adjacency list (or vice versa) a lot of simple tools are going to fall down. reply",

For the cleaning / transformation, I found that a very small number of transformations is required, and that we need to review them as a team including business owners. So, I wrote a simple grammar that is very English-like; that gets translated into Polars operations under the covers in Python. It covers 98% + of my ingestion needs, and means that we focus on the needs of the logical data transformations as a team. Business users can easily make changes for sources they manage. One of the concepts is a “map”, for old values to new values. Those we keep in Excel in Git, so that business users can edit / maintain them. Being Excel, we’re careful to validate the import of those rules when we do a run, mainly to indicate where there’s been a lot of change to identify where there might be an unintended change. Excel makes me nervous in data processing work in general (exploration with Pivots is great, though I’ve moved to Visidata as my first tool of choice). But for years of running in this way we’ve worked around Excel lax approach to data, such as interpreting numerical ID fields as numbers rather than strings. For output “rendering”, because everything is in Polars, we can most frequently simply output to CSV. We use Jinja for some funky cases. reply",

My main thoughts on where it could be improved, or where I see potential struggles, are when: - People aren't comfortable or familiar with coding/Python.\n  - You get into more complex imports like historical data, transactional data, etc. There you might have like 15 transaction types that have to be mapped, all with different fields, math, and conditional logic where the requirements become too much for just prompting ChatGPT effectively, and iterating on the Python can get pretty involved.\n  - The source data structure and transformation needs aren't consistently the same, leading to a lot of 'throwaway' or heavily modified scripts for each unique case.\n  - Tasks like VLOOKUPs or enriching data come into play, which might add manual coding or complexity beyond a simple 1-to-1 source-to-destination script. These are the areas where I'm exploring if a more structured way could offer benefits in terms of repeatability and accessibility for a wider range of users or complex scenarios.

Right now the most relevant mapping process I have to do is taking Amazon product data and transforming it to a Shopify upload csv. The largest of these is around 20k rows, so nothing crazy.

I made a bare bones spreadsheet with under 10 columns, which makes it much easier to work with the data. Once I'm satisfied, I run it through a python script, which turns it into a Shopify conforming csv. Because of different needs of clients, I almost always have to modify the script, but less and less each time, and Cursor makes the edits pretty easy, as long as I review each proposed change and prevent it from getting the script. Good thing about cursor is that it can run its own tests against the input csv in agent mode and debug autonomously. reply",

          "text": "This is a major part of my job - we're a small team that works with close to 100 partners in the nonprofit sector, who all store similar data differently in CSV, PDFs, 2-3 industry-specific CRMs, etc. that we need to standardize and load. Our partners have small datasets (usually <2000 rows, maybe 20 columns or so), that are most of the time is extremely poorly formatted. We work in a single domain, so each partner's data is largely a different formatted version of the same common elements. We have a template with accompanying documentation - partners with technical teams and well-structured data can basically self-serve with SQL. We have a series of meetings where we map columns and values, review errors, etc. More irritating than the data transformations is understanding the structure of the data and practical use, e.g., the same column for Partner A means something entirely different for Partner B. Transforming it might not be the problem - making sure everyone across our teams understands what it means and where it should go is a large pain point in mapping, but the coding of this logic is trivial. For non-technical partners where we handle the prep, over time I wrote a small internal Python library just building off DataFrames that contains a few hundred tests to validate the data, plus a set of commonly used data cleaning functions that are flexible in their inputs. We connect to APIs to verify addresses, time zones, where we can. We now use LLMs more frequently to parse and structure fields to our standard, but it is still painful to review results from the LLM and ensure correctness. Each incoming file will result in an accompanying Jupyter notebook that runs all the relevant scripts. Issue with working Excel (formulas, Office JS/PY Scripts, manual edits) has always been version tracking - difficult to replicate work if new versions of files come in while we are prepping the data. If we find an error post-import, it is great to be able to track down where and why we made the decision or coding error. I haven't tried Power Query though. I have tried OpenRefine, but I think sometimes it slows me down for easy functions, and API-based data transformations becoming a separate task. When we have interns, coordinating cleaning / prep on a single file across users can be tricky. We did try an internal POC of a UI based tool to allow users to map their own data, start cleaning it, but honestly, either a) the partner would have a data analyst or steward that didn't need it, or b) the partner wouldn't have enough of a skillset to feel comfortable cleaning it. Plus pretty often we'll need to join data from multiple spreadsheets, but conditionally use certain rows from one or the other to get the most up-to-date data, which can be difficult to do. Didn't feel as if this was worth the effort to continue with. Fuzzy de-duplication validation is a pain, or anything where you actually want to check with the partner about its correctness - like if I notice that an email is spelled correctly because it almost matches the person's last name, but 1 letter different - becomes a long list of bullet points in an email. Something I would like is an easy way to flag and share errors and have a partner correct those in a friendly UI, then store those changes as code, without a long series of emails or meetings. We've a few times had an Excel file uploaded to Sharepoint, then with a script that automatically adds a comment to cells with errors -> but again, some people just aren't comfortable working with Excel, or get confused when they see a very structured version of their data with additional formatting, and there is no convenient way to track or replicate their changes. There are always also one-off corrections that will need to be made as well - I've just sort of accepted this, and so we generate a list of warnings / recommendations for the partner to review or correct post-import based on the test results rather that us trying to do it. That has worked fine. reply",

          "text": "Wow, thanks for the detailed and insightful breakdown of your process. This really resonates a lot of the complexities I've been exploring and encountered as an implementation consultant. A few things particularly stood out to me: - Your point about semantic mapping (\"understanding the structure... what it means and where it should go\") being more irritating than the actual coding of transformations is spot on. Domain expertise on these things can make a big difference.\n\n  - The version tracking issues with Excel and the need to trace back decisions or errors are a big reason Excel isn't scalable. I totally agree with you and think Excel is bad for this kind of stuff and repeatable transformations/processes are important.\n  - Your desire for an easier way to flag/share errors with partners for correction and then effectively store those changes as part of a repeatable process (like 'code' or a versioned configuration) is a fascinating challenge in collaborative data onboarding. It seems crucial for those fixes to not be one-offs especially when dealing with partners/clients which are notoriously slow. I've used Flatfile in the past, but its limiting in that its all about one-offs and transformations aren't repeated. It sounds like you've built a robust internal Python library to manage a lot of this, which is impressive. When you use Jupyter notebooks for each incoming file: - How do you manage the reusability of common logic or tests across those notebooks, especially if a core cleaning function needs an update that should apply to many different partner files?\n  - And how do less technical team members (like the interns you mentioned) interact with or contribute to that Python/notebook-based process, particularly if they need to understand or slightly modify a transformation rule? And for your usage of LLM, is that mostly for mapping source field to target fields? Thanks again for sharing such a comprehensive view, it's incredibly helpful for understanding the friction points and the need for traceable, repeatable solutions. reply",

          "text": "Course! These are one-time migrations, so at most we have 3-4 projects happening concurrently and don't need to worry about backwards compatibility either. We can just import a specific version or branch of the library, or at worst,  we just copy and paste the function and make the change in the notebook. But a majority of the functions we've put work into in the library are really the consistently applied across any incoming data files - API scripts, de-duplication, assigning IDs... honestly any changes like this are usually pretty easy to make. The tests are always consistent across files and primarily check for the validity of the upload (right type, for example, or logic (start times have end times, etc.). Every test should work for every file ever, since those are based on the platform and upload constraints rather than partner data. Short answer is they don't. For onboarding interns into the process, I write a skeleton notebook that imports the internal library and walks them through cleaning a file. But we would hire for interns that have background in coding and data cleaning. Starting out, rather than change a existing function, they might add a line of code in the notebook that changes the data in a way that the existing function would now work, for example. There are cases where specific-business logic needs to be coded into a function, but we would just write those ad-hoc. This isn't an upload that needs to be done automatically or very quickly, so that hasn't been a problem. The only reason other team members would contribute to this would be around shaping the business logic of which fields should be uploaded where and how they should be formatted, etc. But that data review part that sometimes needs to be done is very tricky, e.g., checking that the transformed results are what they want. It mostly happens in Excel - we did build a POC UI where they would upload a CSV, and they could click through each record and review and suggest changes in a cleaner way. For LLMs, we don't use them for mapping, but we've tested it and it works fine. The LLM mapping doesn't really save us a ton of time compared to us just looking through the file and assigning columns in our mapping file (which is composed of about 120 columns). If we wanted to deploy it and allow the partner to upload a sheet and the LLM to suggest a mapping, that could work. (The mapping step in the demo video on your site looks great!) Instead we use them to format and extract unstructured data -> for example, we might need to pull tags out of descriptive text, or extract event hours out of a string of text describing the event. The LLM can do this really well now with structured JSON outputs, but reviewing it to ensure it is correct is still a manual process. reply",

          "text": "This was roughly half my job a decade ago. Literally because I split my time 50/50 between two separate projects, one of which was a business analytics automation project that was designed for exactly this purpose. Take all of the data exported from the various project management and issue tracking systems used by different product teams, transform as necessary, then import to a common corporate analytics system upper management used to track progress metrics. The idea was to replace all of the bespoke custom Excel workflows that various program management teams used to do it themselves, so we were self-funding based on the estimated cost savings of replacing manual work, meaning I had pretty much free reign to do it however I wanted as long as I could get people to use it. I did it entirely in Python, making heavy use of Pandas, creating a toolchain that ingested mapping definitions from the users and relied on fuzzy matching (i.e. stemming, de-capitalization, recognizing word roots) to categorize field names into a common definition set used by the corporate system. It wasn't a 100% solution, more like 95%, but the reality of this kind of work is we had a real garbage-in problem anyway that no software could solve. Extracting data from an issue tracker relies upon developers using it correctly in the first place. If you have a bunch of workflow transitions but whoever works an issue just transitions them all at once when work is complete, there's no way to know how long everything actually took. You can only extract information that was actually recorded. Coercing dates into a single format standard is fairly simple to do, but if the dates were wrong in the original format, they'll still be wrong in the corrected format. reply",

          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases. There are other exciting workflows, but I should really post a video on that. You could do anything with unix philosophy! reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

My understanding is that Aider itself is free, but you have to pay per token when using an API key for your LLM of choice. I can look up for myself the prices of the various LLMs, but it doesn't help much, since I have no intuition whatsoever about how many tokens I am likely to consume. The attraction of something like Zed or Cursor for me is that I just have a fixed monthly cost to worry about. I'd love to try Aider, as I suspect it suits my style of work better, but without having any idea how much it would cost me, I'm afraid of trying. reply",

Normally, I add the required files, change to architect or ask mode (depends on the problem I want to solve), explain what my problem is and how I want it to be solved. If the Aider answer satisfies me, I change to coding mode and allow the changes. No magic, I have no idea how a single prompt can generate $4.

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

It feels like magic - editing code and fixing compile errors until it builds. The downside is I’m reviewing the code a lot less since I just let the agent run. So far, I’ve only tried it on vibe coding game development, where every model I’ve tested struggles. It says “I rewrote X to be more robust and fixed the bug you mentioned,” yet the bug still remains. I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass. Also, give Zed’s Edit Predictions a try. When refactoring, I often just keep hitting Tab to accept suggestions throughout the file. reply",

All the models use the old function signatures, but Claud Code then sees compile error and fixes it. Compared to Zed Agent, Claude Code is: \n- Better at editing files. Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI. I plan to test other tools when my Claude Code subscription expires next month. reply",

Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

This works great.I always know where to put something and where to find it again later. I also don't keep tabs open, I write things on a Todo list in Obsidian.

Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around. Pay a lot of attention to yourself when you're looking for historical information: what do you search for?  Are there key things you often look up over and over?

Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

It also helps me spot patterns in what I’m learning over time, which is surprisingly motivating. reply",

For example, if I discover an interesting React library, I create a new entry like this: https://i.imgur.com/dDlStkZ.png A great feature is that Logseq understands page hierarchies, so if I click on [[Dev/JS]], it presents a clear hierarchical overview: https://i.imgur.com/z9hGmmh.png Using this approach, I've stopped bookmarking sites in my browser altogether. In Logseq, I can connect useful things to each other, add entire notes, and more, as shown here: https://i.imgur.com/Krld2cS.png If I want to remember something, I just add a #card tag to the block, and it automatically syncs with Anki via a plugin. reply",

I do, however, keep all my old code. Every throwaway line I've ever written is saved somewhere, even if it is just in git history on old throwaway projects. So when I do need to do something again, I don't need to re-do research or figure it out from scratch... I have my working solutions already stored. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

I don't worry about them; I'll use them often enough that I remember. Some things I learned are interesting in a \"huh, interesting\" kind of way - mild surprise, and then move on.  I don't bother with them, either, because who cares?  They aren't worth remembering. Some things change who I am.  I don't bother writing those down, either.  They are recorded in who I am; I don't need a file of notes.  (They might be interesting to someone else , but so far the world is not beating a path to my door to read such a file.) Some I can just Google.  I can search Google as fast as I can search my notes file - faster, because I have Google on more machines. The only ones I bother to write down were ones that took some digging to find out, and that I'm probably going to want to know how to do again, but only rarely.  That is a small number of things. reply",

Other things include planning and documenting projects like travel planning. If I write it down now and have it in one place, I'll look at it at the planned time I'll use it (during the trip). Another example is info I had to watch a YouTube video for that can be paraphrased. Cleaning and descaling my espresso machine is a good example. It's a few textual lines and I know I do it once every few months, so having it essentially cached in my notes comes in handy. If I can't Google it (at least in a reasonable amount of time) and I suspect it may come up again, I'll jot it down.

We didn't really care when it was factory workers, or payroll clerks, or switchboard operators. But now that it's going after programmers, now we care. The good news is that there are a bunch of other jobs still left. And for a long time yet there are still lots of IT jobs that are safe. To be fair, low-skill programming jobs have been replaced for years. Lots of them outsourced offshore. (Does it matter if your job goes to AI or a Bengali?). But today's systems are huge, and complex, and require a lot more than what AI can do (impressive as that is.) Frankly, if you work at a place, and you look around the room, and all you see are cogs in the machine, and you dont want to be a cog, then you're already in the wrong place. reply",

The problem lingers is that no matter if ai cant do your job, it can do the job of a hell lot of people, and if all that people are unemployed and in gigs eventually the economy will collapse, doesn't matter if you are a writer or a HVAC, and see robots if you are the last. The issue isn’t just job loss, but the velocity of change. Capitalism isn’t designed for near-instantaneous obsolescence. Government wont do shit because this is a gazillion dollar industry and also they are still figuring out what's the internet. Jobs wont be created at the same pace they are destroyed, and AI will be able to take on those roles too. Companies will follow what shopify and duolingo did. even the pope is concerned, hence its name. AI will disrupt ALL industries. hell, even ai art is objectively better and cheaper than human art.

So, unless there is some radical revolutionary improvement to AI just put that out of your mind. Now, it seems your concerns are anchored on employment and not anything regarding technology.  I have been laid off during my career and survived many layoffs.  The first round of layoffs I experienced in the big brand web world was the same year I received a negative review.  I kept my job while other highly rated people were pushed out the door. Here is my learning about career sustainability: * If you don't like what you do then all you are doing is funding a life style.  If you both hate what you do AND do not have a shit ton of personal disposable income sitting in a bank account after 5 years its not worth it.  Tell them to fuck off, take a hit to your income/lifestyle and do something else.  You will thank me later.  This one piece of advice will add years to your life. * If you want to have a job that withstands all layoffs (aside from the business completely folding) do what is most needed.  In my case I was a first year front end developer at Travelocity back in 2008 when the market crashed and before massive frameworks did your job for you.  They couldn't hire front end developers to save their life.  Its just like now in that most of the candidates were extremely childish or extremely incompetent, but now businesses looks the other way while colossal frameworks and tool sets do most of the work.  I kept my job when others didn't because I was more valuable to the business, even with a shit annual review, than people who were cherished employees. * If you want to be taken seriously on the job do only two things well: 1) guard your time and 2) take care of people.  Be ruthless about these two things.  If you spend 4 hours a week actually doing your job and the coworker next to you spends 40 hours a week doing their job you are 10x more valuable.  This is counter-intuitive because they are working hard you aren't doing shit.  Hard work is not valued.  Delivery is valued.  If you want hard work to be valued then get out of IT and becoming an independent contractor of a trade skill.  If you are a narcissist your more competent peers will see through your bullshit.  Seriously, learn to take care of people. * If you want to get promoted do only three things well: 1) deliver what your boss asks of you, 2) measure things, and 3) demonstrate superior communication and organizational skills.  I have seen this work in the corporate world and I have heard these exact things more than once from brigadier generals in the US Army. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

          "text": "Not ignorant at all. I'm not sure if they’ve added any monetization features over the years. Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

Such is the way of things these days. I dropped Soundcloud paid version too, and migrated to just YouTube. Currently YouTube is trying very hard to learn to reply to my fans AS me, but through pushing buttons to immediately supply AI-generated responses. I'm sure anyone else with a substantial YouTube presence has seen this too. So far, they are not self-pressing the button and taking over replying to my fans for me, against my will. So far. They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible. Regarding OP, and in the light of what I've said, maybe ask yourself in what way you can disambiguate yourself from any random AI-powered startup in targeting what for the other startup will be an arbitrary or shotgun selection of customer targets. Is there an audience you can work specifically for, and is there a way you can signal to that audience that you're particularly aware of them and interested in working for them? reply",

I've specifically mentioned Discord because there's no easy way to discover communities without being invited, so if you can actually discover relevant Discord communities and monitor discussions (beyond the few sites that aggregate some popular communities), then you have a USP, since most products don't do that, at least in any capacity that people think is worth paying for. reply",

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently.

Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

Ergo, there will be fewer junior dev positions and senior dev salaries can capture some of the additional value they deliver. Whether that's offset by the increase in senior supply as junior -> senior conversions happen...? The two areas that will likely expand demand to absorb those junior devs are: (1) Integration engineering (i.e. poorly-documented interface to poorly-documented interface) (2) Testing (because if kloc are cheap, there will be more money to validate -- and it will make people feel safer to have human-in-the-loop before sign-off / production). Coding LLMs are always going to be better at things well-represented in their training sets. Which is to say, the most popular languages, API styles, apps as of todayish. So, other things will be the best use of human time. reply",

However, I don't really think you will see a massive drop-off in employment for two reasons.  First, competition is going away.  If your developers are x times more productive, so are your competitors developers.  I can see a bit less need in non-product companies if more domain experts are able to build their own tools, or generalized agentic tools eliminate some of the need for custom tooling. However, I think there is a second thing that is often overlooked here. It seems the angle is always 'oh companies can replace developers' but no one seems to consider that developers can replace companies.  I think you are going to see small teams of very skilled people replace able to make amazing products.  There are limits to what llm's can do on their own but a skilled engineer who masters the tooling and can unblock the models and knows the techniques to keep the models productive as the codebase grows will be able to produce amazing things far beyond what they could ever produce before.  I think you are going to see an explosion of new, smaller companies.  I think if you are an engineer you shouldn't be gloomy, you should be excited. reply",

You see this now with the \"Indians hiring Indians\" phenomenon. Trump put the brakes on that, so currently the only thing that's certain is uncertainty. My take is that there will be an attempt to replace at least the bottom end of outsourcing with LLMs, so more pressure on offshore labour to perform and, over time, fewer positions overall, as junior roles have already evaporated around here and eventually that will translate to fewer seniors. reply",

After a while, the Gen Y seniors will retire and/or die and it will be impossible to source a senior developer with actual knowledge. Wages will skyrocket for a few Gen Z experts, but in general there will be a shortage and the entire industry will eventually reboot, although I am stuck to speculate how exactly.

          "text": "We're on the cusp of an indie software boom. The reasons why exist in Taleb's antifragility thesis: the antifragile will gain from disorder. The nature of the tech industry, in the decades roughly since the Cold War ended(which put to rest a certain pattern of tech focused on the MIC and moved SV forward into its leadership position), has promoted fragility along several of Taleb's dimensions: it aims to scale, it aims to centralize, and it aims to intervene. The pinnacle achievement of this trend is probably the iPhone, a convergent do-everything device that promises to change your life. But it's axiomatic(in Taleb's view, which I will defer to since his arguments are good enough for me) that this won't last, and with talk of \"the end of the US empire\", and a broader pessimism in tech, there seems to be popular agreement that we are done with the scale narrative. AI is a last holdout for that narrative since it justifies further semiconductor investment, stokes national security fears of an \"AI race\" and so on - it appeals to forces with big pocketbooks, that are also big in scale, and also in a position of fragility themselves. But eventually they will tap out too, for the same reasons. Whether that's a \"next year\" thing or a \"twenty years\" thing is hard to predict - the fall of the USSR was similarly hard to predict. The things that are antifragile within software are too abstract to intentionally develop within a codebase, and are more a measure of philosophy and how one models the world with data - CollapseOS is at the extreme end of this, where the viewpoint is bacterial - \"all our computing infrastructure is doomed if it is not maintainable by solo operators\" - but there are intermediate points along it where the kinds of software that are needed are in that realm of a plugin to a large app or an extension to an existing framework, and development intentionally aims not to break outside that scope. That thesis agrees with the \"small niches\" view of things. Since we have succeeded in putting computers into every place we can think of, many of the things we need to do with them do already have a conventional \"way of doing it,\" but can exist in a standard and don't need to be formalized behind a platform and business model - and LLM stuff does actually have some role in serving that by being an 80% translator of intent, while a technical specialist has work in adding finish and polish. And that side of things agrees with going deeper into the stack. I believe one pressing issue that's faced with this transition is the inclination brought from the corporate dev environment to create a generalized admixture of higher and lower level coding - to do everything as a JS app with WASM bits that are \"rewritten in Rust\" - when what indie software needs is more Turbo Pascals, Hypercards, and Visual Basics, environments that are tuned to be complete within themselves and towards the kinds of apps being written, while being \"compatible enough\" to deploy to a variety of end-user systems. reply",

My reasoning is simple if AI handles all technical skills then no technical skills are required for the job anymore. Where’s your reasoning? In addition to this “unqualified hand waving”. Look at your own baseless statement. At least I qualified my statement with “it’s possible”. If LLMs solve the hallucination issue then it’s stuff like this that will sit at the top of the hierarchy. People who make grand claims with confidence and play politics to get to the top. You say my statement is handwavy but really that’s another way of saying “I don’t need to prove you wrong I’m just going to make a baseless claim about how your statement is utter crap but do it in a way as to subvert HN politeness rules, i can say it in a way that doesn’t raise any eyebrows and people who already agree with me will automatically take my side even though I didn’t present any additional new reasoning here”. This is what I’m talking about. It’s people who are good at strategies like this who will occupy the top spots in the future should LLMs continue to improve. Case in point.

I have also really appreciated something that felt much less janky, had better vim bindings, and wasn't slow to start even on a very fast computer. You can completely botch Cursor if you type really fast. On an older mid-range laptop, I ran into problems with a bunch of its auto-pair stuff of all things. reply",

I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases.

And agents require always top-notch models that are expensive and can't run locally well. So when Codex came out, it skipped to that. But mct leverages the weak models well, do things not possible otherwise. And it does even better with stronger models. Rewards stronger models, but doesn't punish smaller models. So basically, you can use save money and do more using mct + codex. But I hear aider is terminal tool so maybe try and mct + aider? reply",

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass.

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI.

          "text": "From a funding perspective I suppose it's pretty simple - like with all businesses the owners pony up the cash. The regular model is that you need cash, so you go looking for it, selling (part) ownership. In this case you have pre-determined the owners, and presumably their share %, so presumably they're putting up the cash. Alternatively you can go with a non-ownership approach. Ie a loan. That'll vote either an interest rate, and usually dome collateral (which I guess also comes from the owners.) If you go this route I recommend you get a lawyer to clearly explain the implications of liability - one participant can easily be on the hook for the whole loan, not just their share of it. They'd be much better off taking small individual loans to \"buy their share \" than participating in a group loan. Future admin work may also be affected by your governance model. There will be times when all owners need to sign, and you need to thus have mechanisms to strip ownership if the person leaves, or dies. Shareholdings which become part of their estate, and are inherited are a concern. In short, you need a lawyer well versed in these structures. Not just internet advice. I applaud your vision, but you need to think very carefully through all aspects of this. reply",

          "text": "Lot of work happened in the last 5-10 years in the web3 space around tech-enabled participatory governance, with some funding backdrop because it's on top of a crypto platform. ENS is kind of the poster child https://docs.ens.domains/learn/protocol/ In terms of participation incentive models I like pointing people to slicing pie. The concept is simple enough and can learned from their free materials. Helpful mental model quantifying sweat \"equity\" where equity can be voting shares, or actual financial shares: https://slicingpie.com/ In terms of governance policy that is specific to your domain- what are the incentives and measures and countermeasures to ensure good behavior from the different roles of participants particular to therapy- there are certainly codes of conduct in the therapy space but probably this is going to be new work for you. I have read quite a bit in the anarchy space, including Graeber, and Chomsky's references and pull-outs from the moments during the Spanish Civil War when there was real movement here- regret to say that the prior thinking does not strike me as anywhere near sufficient to serve as models for the current shape of the world. A lot of new work has to get laid down for these to be real things. Democracy is a fragile mechanism that as we see can collapse quickly under lots of limited resource regimes and when community trust is fractured. High trust does not scale. Low trust is needed to scale and professionalize. But +1, think now is a good time for worker-controlled services to serve as a growing alternative to platform controlled services (just saw first Amazon therapy ad today, like, are you effing kidding me?)

          "text": "For one thing a lot of tools like Excel do unwanted data transformations,  such as importing from a CSV they try to guess whether text is meant to be a string or a number and sometimes guess wrong.  You can spend a lot of time disabling this behavior or preventing it or fixing it up afterwards,  but frequently bad data just plain corrupts the analysis or target system. You can't really trust the time handling functions on any platform which is some  of the reason why languages like Python, and Java, might have two or three libraries for working with dates and times in the standard library because people realized the old one was unfixable.  Plenty of Javascript date handling libraries have told people \"look,  this is obsolete,  it's time to move on\" not just because that's the Javascript way,  but because the libraries really were error prone. In a real programming language it's straightforward to fix those problems,  in a fake programming language it is difficult or impossible. If you've got a strange index structure in the source or destination data, for instance, many tools fall down.  For instance if you want to convert nested set trees https://blog.uniauth.com/nested-set-model to something more normal like an adjacency list (or vice versa) a lot of simple tools are going to fall down. reply",

My main thoughts on where it could be improved, or where I see potential struggles, are when: - People aren't comfortable or familiar with coding/Python.\n  - You get into more complex imports like historical data, transactional data, etc. There you might have like 15 transaction types that have to be mapped, all with different fields, math, and conditional logic where the requirements become too much for just prompting ChatGPT effectively, and iterating on the Python can get pretty involved.\n  - The source data structure and transformation needs aren't consistently the same, leading to a lot of 'throwaway' or heavily modified scripts for each unique case.\n  - Tasks like VLOOKUPs or enriching data come into play, which might add manual coding or complexity beyond a simple 1-to-1 source-to-destination script. These are the areas where I'm exploring if a more structured way could offer benefits in terms of repeatability and accessibility for a wider range of users or complex scenarios.

It covers 98% + of my ingestion needs, and means that we focus on the needs of the logical data transformations as a team. Business users can easily make changes for sources they manage. One of the concepts is a “map”, for old values to new values. Those we keep in Excel in Git, so that business users can edit / maintain them. Being Excel, we’re careful to validate the import of those rules when we do a run, mainly to indicate where there’s been a lot of change to identify where there might be an unintended change.

But for years of running in this way we’ve worked around Excel lax approach to data, such as interpreting numerical ID fields as numbers rather than strings.

Try to build a chain of steps that can always be redone starting at that copy If you have any control over what comes in, try to make some baseline requirements:. A stable identifier for each record, a parseable number format with clarity about US vs world conventies like , vs .  and a stable date format like ISO 8601.   Also a real structured format like json, xml, ...  works better than csv, which is better than xls(x) From there, it depends. If there is a lot of data and you need a quick estimate,   the POSIX toolset is a good choice: cut, grep, sed, jq, ... If there is a lot of data, reasonably structured, load it minimally parsed in an sql table as (line number,source id,line of text) and parse from there.  The database will auto parallelize. If the data is hard to parse, grab a real programming language.  You probably want something that can deal with character data quickly, e.g. Go Java Rust C# ....   Python or R work if the amount of data is low or you can lean heavily on things like numpy.  PHP, VBA,... tend to be slow and error prone. My experience with ETL tooling is it's eternally 90% there.  It should theoretically solve this, but I always seem to fall back on programming languages and fight the tools after a while. reply",

Right now the most relevant mapping process I have to do is taking Amazon product data and transforming it to a Shopify upload csv. The largest of these is around 20k rows, so nothing crazy. There are apps that do this via APIs, but at a large enough scale, they are not reliable. The process takes around 10 hours, with the help of a VA who does the lower level cleaning stuff. I made a bare bones spreadsheet with under 10 columns, which makes it much easier to work with the data. Once I'm satisfied, I run it through a python script, which turns it into a Shopify conforming csv. Because of different needs of clients, I almost always have to modify the script, but less and less each time, and Cursor makes the edits pretty easy, as long as I review each proposed change and prevent it from getting the script. Good thing about cursor is that it can run its own tests against the input csv in agent mode and debug autonomously. reply",

          "text": "This is a major part of my job - we're a small team that works with close to 100 partners in the nonprofit sector, who all store similar data differently in CSV, PDFs, 2-3 industry-specific CRMs, etc. that we need to standardize and load. Our partners have small datasets (usually <2000 rows, maybe 20 columns or so), that are most of the time is extremely poorly formatted. We work in a single domain, so each partner's data is largely a different formatted version of the same common elements. We have a template with accompanying documentation - partners with technical teams and well-structured data can basically self-serve with SQL. We have a series of meetings where we map columns and values, review errors, etc. More irritating than the data transformations is understanding the structure of the data and practical use, e.g., the same column for Partner A means something entirely different for Partner B. Transforming it might not be the problem - making sure everyone across our teams understands what it means and where it should go is a large pain point in mapping, but the coding of this logic is trivial. For non-technical partners where we handle the prep, over time I wrote a small internal Python library just building off DataFrames that contains a few hundred tests to validate the data, plus a set of commonly used data cleaning functions that are flexible in their inputs. We connect to APIs to verify addresses, time zones, where we can. We now use LLMs more frequently to parse and structure fields to our standard, but it is still painful to review results from the LLM and ensure correctness. Each incoming file will result in an accompanying Jupyter notebook that runs all the relevant scripts. Issue with working Excel (formulas, Office JS/PY Scripts, manual edits) has always been version tracking - difficult to replicate work if new versions of files come in while we are prepping the data. If we find an error post-import, it is great to be able to track down where and why we made the decision or coding error. I haven't tried Power Query though. I have tried OpenRefine, but I think sometimes it slows me down for easy functions, and API-based data transformations becoming a separate task. When we have interns, coordinating cleaning / prep on a single file across users can be tricky. We did try an internal POC of a UI based tool to allow users to map their own data, start cleaning it, but honestly, either a) the partner would have a data analyst or steward that didn't need it, or b) the partner wouldn't have enough of a skillset to feel comfortable cleaning it. Plus pretty often we'll need to join data from multiple spreadsheets, but conditionally use certain rows from one or the other to get the most up-to-date data, which can be difficult to do. Didn't feel as if this was worth the effort to continue with. Fuzzy de-duplication validation is a pain, or anything where you actually want to check with the partner about its correctness - like if I notice that an email is spelled correctly because it almost matches the person's last name, but 1 letter different - becomes a long list of bullet points in an email. Something I would like is an easy way to flag and share errors and have a partner correct those in a friendly UI, then store those changes as code, without a long series of emails or meetings. We've a few times had an Excel file uploaded to Sharepoint, then with a script that automatically adds a comment to cells with errors -> but again, some people just aren't comfortable working with Excel, or get confused when they see a very structured version of their data with additional formatting, and there is no convenient way to track or replicate their changes. There are always also one-off corrections that will need to be made as well - I've just sort of accepted this, and so we generate a list of warnings / recommendations for the partner to review or correct post-import based on the test results rather that us trying to do it. That has worked fine. reply",

          "text": "Wow, thanks for the detailed and insightful breakdown of your process. This really resonates a lot of the complexities I've been exploring and encountered as an implementation consultant. A few things particularly stood out to me: - Your point about semantic mapping (\"understanding the structure... what it means and where it should go\") being more irritating than the actual coding of transformations is spot on. Domain expertise on these things can make a big difference.\n\n  - The version tracking issues with Excel and the need to trace back decisions or errors are a big reason Excel isn't scalable. I totally agree with you and think Excel is bad for this kind of stuff and repeatable transformations/processes are important.\n  - Your desire for an easier way to flag/share errors with partners for correction and then effectively store those changes as part of a repeatable process (like 'code' or a versioned configuration) is a fascinating challenge in collaborative data onboarding. It seems crucial for those fixes to not be one-offs especially when dealing with partners/clients which are notoriously slow. I've used Flatfile in the past, but its limiting in that its all about one-offs and transformations aren't repeated. It sounds like you've built a robust internal Python library to manage a lot of this, which is impressive. When you use Jupyter notebooks for each incoming file: - How do you manage the reusability of common logic or tests across those notebooks, especially if a core cleaning function needs an update that should apply to many different partner files?\n  - And how do less technical team members (like the interns you mentioned) interact with or contribute to that Python/notebook-based process, particularly if they need to understand or slightly modify a transformation rule? And for your usage of LLM, is that mostly for mapping source field to target fields? Thanks again for sharing such a comprehensive view, it's incredibly helpful for understanding the friction points and the need for traceable, repeatable solutions. reply",

          "text": "Course! These are one-time migrations, so at most we have 3-4 projects happening concurrently and don't need to worry about backwards compatibility either. We can just import a specific version or branch of the library, or at worst,  we just copy and paste the function and make the change in the notebook. But a majority of the functions we've put work into in the library are really the consistently applied across any incoming data files - API scripts, de-duplication, assigning IDs... honestly any changes like this are usually pretty easy to make. The tests are always consistent across files and primarily check for the validity of the upload (right type, for example, or logic (start times have end times, etc.). Every test should work for every file ever, since those are based on the platform and upload constraints rather than partner data. Short answer is they don't. For onboarding interns into the process, I write a skeleton notebook that imports the internal library and walks them through cleaning a file. But we would hire for interns that have background in coding and data cleaning. Starting out, rather than change a existing function, they might add a line of code in the notebook that changes the data in a way that the existing function would now work, for example. There are cases where specific-business logic needs to be coded into a function, but we would just write those ad-hoc. This isn't an upload that needs to be done automatically or very quickly, so that hasn't been a problem. The only reason other team members would contribute to this would be around shaping the business logic of which fields should be uploaded where and how they should be formatted, etc. But that data review part that sometimes needs to be done is very tricky, e.g., checking that the transformed results are what they want. It mostly happens in Excel - we did build a POC UI where they would upload a CSV, and they could click through each record and review and suggest changes in a cleaner way. For LLMs, we don't use them for mapping, but we've tested it and it works fine. The LLM mapping doesn't really save us a ton of time compared to us just looking through the file and assigning columns in our mapping file (which is composed of about 120 columns). If we wanted to deploy it and allow the partner to upload a sheet and the LLM to suggest a mapping, that could work. (The mapping step in the demo video on your site looks great!) Instead we use them to format and extract unstructured data -> for example, we might need to pull tags out of descriptive text, or extract event hours out of a string of text describing the event. The LLM can do this really well now with structured JSON outputs, but reviewing it to ensure it is correct is still a manual process. reply",

          "text": "This was roughly half my job a decade ago. Literally because I split my time 50/50 between two separate projects, one of which was a business analytics automation project that was designed for exactly this purpose. Take all of the data exported from the various project management and issue tracking systems used by different product teams, transform as necessary, then import to a common corporate analytics system upper management used to track progress metrics. The idea was to replace all of the bespoke custom Excel workflows that various program management teams used to do it themselves, so we were self-funding based on the estimated cost savings of replacing manual work, meaning I had pretty much free reign to do it however I wanted as long as I could get people to use it. I did it entirely in Python, making heavy use of Pandas, creating a toolchain that ingested mapping definitions from the users and relied on fuzzy matching (i.e. stemming, de-capitalization, recognizing word roots) to categorize field names into a common definition set used by the corporate system. It wasn't a 100% solution, more like 95%, but the reality of this kind of work is we had a real garbage-in problem anyway that no software could solve. Extracting data from an issue tracker relies upon developers using it correctly in the first place. If you have a bunch of workflow transitions but whoever works an issue just transitions them all at once when work is complete, there's no way to know how long everything actually took. You can only extract information that was actually recorded. Coercing dates into a single format standard is fairly simple to do, but if the dates were wrong in the original format, they'll still be wrong in the corrected format. reply",

Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible..

Mostly it's just bullets.  If a bullet is critical I'll prepend it with !!!.  If it's a task, I'll use * instead of - for the bullet marker (then move the task to my separate task tracker later - notes doc isn't good for long-term task management) If I want to tag the note explicitly with a \"tag\", I'll add one in brackets - but honestly these aren't that helpful. Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around. Pay a lot of attention to yourself when you're looking for historical information: what do you search for?  Are there key things you often look up over and over?  If so, what search terms did you use when trying to find them?  Add those explicitly to the entry, so next time you'll find it easier. reply",

          "text": "Currently I use Obsidian to make note of a few key things, but what I'm more excited about is that the way tech is evolving is going to allow us much more expansive solutions for personal knowledge-bases. Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

I don't worry about them; I'll use them often enough that I remember. Some things I learned are interesting in a \"huh, interesting\" kind of way - mild surprise, and then move on.  I don't bother with them, either, because who cares?  They aren't worth remembering. Some things change who I am.  I don't bother writing those down, either.  They are recorded in who I am; I don't need a file of notes.  (They might be interesting to someone else , but so far the world is not beating a path to my door to read such a file.) Some I can just Google.  I can search Google as fast as I can search my notes file - faster, because I have Google on more machines. The only ones I bother to write down were ones that took some digging to find out, and that I'm probably going to want to know how to do again, but only rarely.  That is a small number of things. reply",

When I encounter something worth saving, I simply create a new entry.

For example, if I discover an interesting React library, I create a new entry like this: https://i.imgur.com/dDlStkZ.png A great feature is that Logseq understands page hierarchies, so if I click on [[Dev/JS]], it presents a clear hierarchical overview: https://i.imgur.com/z9hGmmh.png Using this approach, I've stopped bookmarking sites in my browser altogether. In Logseq, I can connect useful things to each other, add entire notes, and more, as shown here: https://i.imgur.com/Krld2cS.png If I want to remember something, I just add a #card tag to the block, and it automatically syncs with Anki via a plugin. reply",

I do, however, keep all my old code. Every throwaway line I've ever written is saved somewhere, even if it is just in git history on old throwaway projects. So when I do need to do something again, I don't need to re-do research or figure it out from scratch... I have my working solutions already stored. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

It will then send me emails about the things that I have saved recently and how they are all connected. You are welcome to try it and share anything feedback that you may have. At the moment, I can save markdown notes, websites, files, anything, and it shows everything in a nice grid view while also generating AI summaries, like TLDR and keywords (which I can then search for.) I will try to add those features / fix those bugs that you suggest. :) https://sunchay.com reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "I think the decline of FILE_ID.DIZ files is largely a byproduct of changing distribution methods. Back in the BBS and early FTP days, these small text files were crucial because they provided a quick summary for file archives, especially when bandwidth was limited, and you couldn't afford to waste time downloading the wrong file. With the rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, project descriptions and metadata have become more integrated. The README.md has essentially replaced FILE_ID.DIZ as the default \"project descriptor\", but with much more flexibility for formatting, linking, and even embedding media. Additionally, the way we discover and share software has changed. We now have package managers, app stores, and automatic metadata parsing tools that handle much of what these files used to do. Plus, we expect modern software to have much more comprehensive documentation than a few lines in a .DIZ file. reply",

Since forever I remember reading in the news that company XYZ 'let go' # thousands of employees in countries A, B, and from departments C, D. I was working in a bank (one of the many) back in the late 00s and one morning the (open space) office was dead silent. It use to have 200+ people but that day it had 20+. Apparently \"Management\" saw something coming (it was the 2008 crisis) and decided to cut costs asap, and the first to go out were the ~200 contractors (back then there was no 'remote' work, so everyone was in the office). I knew one of them, we grew up in the same neighborhood, and he was super angry because they asked them to simply hand over their laptops and walk out. 1 minute notice,  and paid them in the end of the month for the rest of the month and that was that. At _that_ moment I realized that shit doesn't just happens to others on the news, it happens to all of us, it's not an IF it will happen to you/me/anyone, it is a WHEN it will happen.

The good news is that there are a bunch of other jobs still left. And for a long time yet there are still lots of IT jobs that are safe. To be fair, low-skill programming jobs have been replaced for years. Lots of them outsourced offshore. (Does it matter if your job goes to AI or a Bengali?). But today's systems are huge, and complex, and require a lot more than what AI can do (impressive as that is.)

The problem lingers is that no matter if ai cant do your job, it can do the job of a hell lot of people, and if all that people are unemployed and in gigs eventually the economy will collapse, doesn't matter if you are a writer or a HVAC, and see robots if you are the last. The issue isn’t just job loss, but the velocity of change. Capitalism isn’t designed for near-instantaneous obsolescence. Government wont do shit because this is a gazillion dollar industry and also they are still figuring out what's the internet. Jobs wont be created at the same pace they are destroyed, and AI will be able to take on those roles too.

          "text": "AI is hype.  It does do some things, but about 75-80% of the AI business value is based only on FOMO and not any kind of metric or economic factor.  So, unless there is some radical revolutionary improvement to AI just put that out of your mind. Now, it seems your concerns are anchored on employment and not anything regarding technology.  I have been laid off during my career and survived many layoffs.  The first round of layoffs I experienced in the big brand web world was the same year I received a negative review.  I kept my job while other highly rated people were pushed out the door. Here is my learning about career sustainability: * If you don't like what you do then all you are doing is funding a life style.  If you both hate what you do AND do not have a shit ton of personal disposable income sitting in a bank account after 5 years its not worth it.  Tell them to fuck off, take a hit to your income/lifestyle and do something else.  You will thank me later.  This one piece of advice will add years to your life. * If you want to have a job that withstands all layoffs (aside from the business completely folding) do what is most needed.  In my case I was a first year front end developer at Travelocity back in 2008 when the market crashed and before massive frameworks did your job for you.  They couldn't hire front end developers to save their life.  Its just like now in that most of the candidates were extremely childish or extremely incompetent, but now businesses looks the other way while colossal frameworks and tool sets do most of the work.  I kept my job when others didn't because I was more valuable to the business, even with a shit annual review, than people who were cherished employees. * If you want to be taken seriously on the job do only two things well: 1) guard your time and 2) take care of people.  Be ruthless about these two things.  If you spend 4 hours a week actually doing your job and the coworker next to you spends 40 hours a week doing their job you are 10x more valuable.  This is counter-intuitive because they are working hard you aren't doing shit.  Hard work is not valued.  Delivery is valued.  If you want hard work to be valued then get out of IT and becoming an independent contractor of a trade skill.  If you are a narcissist your more competent peers will see through your bullshit.  Seriously, learn to take care of people. * If you want to get promoted do only three things well: 1) deliver what your boss asks of you, 2) measure things, and 3) demonstrate superior communication and organizational skills.  I have seen this work in the corporate world and I have heard these exact things more than once from brigadier generals in the US Army. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud.

          "text": "Not ignorant at all. I'm not sure if they’ve added any monetization features over the years. Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

Such is the way of things these days. I dropped Soundcloud paid version too, and migrated to just YouTube. Currently YouTube is trying very hard to learn to reply to my fans AS me, but through pushing buttons to immediately supply AI-generated responses. I'm sure anyone else with a substantial YouTube presence has seen this too. So far, they are not self-pressing the button and taking over replying to my fans for me, against my will. So far. They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible. Regarding OP, and in the light of what I've said, maybe ask yourself in what way you can disambiguate yourself from any random AI-powered startup in targeting what for the other startup will be an arbitrary or shotgun selection of customer targets. Is there an audience you can work specifically for, and is there a way you can signal to that audience that you're particularly aware of them and interested in working for them? reply",

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

We will generate errors at an unprecedented rate. LLMs trained on previous errors and methods won’t catch them. They’ll be more complicated and spread out over the code. We need new tools to visualize the code and track errors. I think what it means to be a programmer will change. More testing, thinking and less klocs. reply",

          "text": "> a lot of work between where we are and where LLMs replace 4 Junior devs The projection from current SOTA is that coding LLMs replace 1 senior dev + 5 junior devs with 1 senior dev + LLM. Ergo, there will be fewer junior dev positions and senior dev salaries can capture some of the additional value they deliver. Whether that's offset by the increase in senior supply as junior -> senior conversions happen...? The two areas that will likely expand demand to absorb those junior devs are: (1) Integration engineering (i.e. poorly-documented interface to poorly-documented interface) (2) Testing (because if kloc are cheap, there will be more money to validate -- and it will make people feel safer to have human-in-the-loop before sign-off / production). Coding LLMs are always going to be better at things well-represented in their training sets. Which is to say, the most popular languages, API styles, apps as of todayish. So, other things will be the best use of human time. reply",

I think another angle to think about this is Junior devs that can leverage AI to learn have a much shorter path to Senior than current Seniors had to take (aka the hard way). If as a Junior you know of things to look out for but don't know the implementation details, AI can help you. For really obscure issues or bugs, I had to scroll through seemingly random StackOverflow results (or Experts Exchange, ha) looking for exact issues that I had, weeding through answers that weren't relevant, things based on older versions, etc. Now you give the context to AI tech stack, data, and your source code, explain the problem with the error message, and ask what might be happening and that shaves a few hours off the old way of trial and error. Even if the 1st answer isn't totally right, a few follow on questions will help narrow it down. reply",

          "text": "The day to day of a software engineering job has changed and will change more depending on how advanced llms get (and all bets are off if we do get to AGI).  However, I don't really think you will see a massive drop-off in employment for two reasons.  First, competition is going away.  If your developers are x times more productive, so are your competitors developers.  I can see a bit less need in non-product companies if more domain experts are able to build their own tools, or generalized agentic tools eliminate some of the need for custom tooling. However, I think there is a second thing that is often overlooked here. It seems the angle is always 'oh companies can replace developers' but no one seems to consider that developers can replace companies.  I think you are going to see small teams of very skilled people replace able to make amazing products.  There are limits to what llm's can do on their own but a skilled engineer who masters the tooling and can unblock the models and knows the techniques to keep the models productive as the codebase grows will be able to produce amazing things far beyond what they could ever produce before.  I think you are going to see an explosion of new, smaller companies.  I think if you are an engineer you shouldn't be gloomy, you should be excited. reply",

You have talented people all over the globe and to date what the best of the best were doing is move to the US. Those were the people guiding/managing outsourced teams, not Americans. You see this now with the \"Indians hiring Indians\" phenomenon. Trump put the brakes on that, so currently the only thing that's certain is uncertainty. My take is that there will be an attempt to replace at least the bottom end of outsourcing with LLMs, so more pressure on offshore labour to perform and, over time, fewer positions overall, as junior roles have already evaporated around here and eventually that will translate to fewer seniors. reply",

After a while, the Gen Y seniors will retire and/or die and it will be impossible to source a senior developer with actual knowledge. Wages will skyrocket for a few Gen Z experts, but in general there will be a shortage and the entire industry will eventually reboot, although I am stuck to speculate how exactly.

          "text": "We're on the cusp of an indie software boom. The reasons why exist in Taleb's antifragility thesis: the antifragile will gain from disorder. The nature of the tech industry, in the decades roughly since the Cold War ended(which put to rest a certain pattern of tech focused on the MIC and moved SV forward into its leadership position), has promoted fragility along several of Taleb's dimensions: it aims to scale, it aims to centralize, and it aims to intervene. The pinnacle achievement of this trend is probably the iPhone, a convergent do-everything device that promises to change your life. But it's axiomatic(in Taleb's view, which I will defer to since his arguments are good enough for me) that this won't last, and with talk of \"the end of the US empire\", and a broader pessimism in tech, there seems to be popular agreement that we are done with the scale narrative. AI is a last holdout for that narrative since it justifies further semiconductor investment, stokes national security fears of an \"AI race\" and so on - it appeals to forces with big pocketbooks, that are also big in scale, and also in a position of fragility themselves. But eventually they will tap out too, for the same reasons. Whether that's a \"next year\" thing or a \"twenty years\" thing is hard to predict - the fall of the USSR was similarly hard to predict. The things that are antifragile within software are too abstract to intentionally develop within a codebase, and are more a measure of philosophy and how one models the world with data - CollapseOS is at the extreme end of this, where the viewpoint is bacterial - \"all our computing infrastructure is doomed if it is not maintainable by solo operators\" - but there are intermediate points along it where the kinds of software that are needed are in that realm of a plugin to a large app or an extension to an existing framework, and development intentionally aims not to break outside that scope. That thesis agrees with the \"small niches\" view of things. Since we have succeeded in putting computers into every place we can think of, many of the things we need to do with them do already have a conventional \"way of doing it,\" but can exist in a standard and don't need to be formalized behind a platform and business model - and LLM stuff does actually have some role in serving that by being an 80% translator of intent, while a technical specialist has work in adding finish and polish. And that side of things agrees with going deeper into the stack. I believe one pressing issue that's faced with this transition is the inclination brought from the corporate dev environment to create a generalized admixture of higher and lower level coding - to do everything as a JS app with WASM bits that are \"rewritten in Rust\" - when what indie software needs is more Turbo Pascals, Hypercards, and Visual Basics, environments that are tuned to be complete within themselves and towards the kinds of apps being written, while being \"compatible enough\" to deploy to a variety of end-user systems. reply",

My reasoning is simple if AI handles all technical skills then no technical skills are required for the job anymore. Where’s your reasoning? In addition to this “unqualified hand waving”. Look at your own baseless statement. At least I qualified my statement with “it’s possible”. If LLMs solve the hallucination issue then it’s stuff like this that will sit at the top of the hierarchy. People who make grand claims with confidence and play politics to get to the top. You say my statement is handwavy but really that’s another way of saying “I don’t need to prove you wrong I’m just going to make a baseless claim about how your statement is utter crap but do it in a way as to subvert HN politeness rules, i can say it in a way that doesn’t raise any eyebrows and people who already agree with me will automatically take my side even though I didn’t present any additional new reasoning here”. This is what I’m talking about. It’s people who are good at strategies like this who will occupy the top spots in the future should LLMs continue to improve. Case in point. If karma was voting for the next person in a leadership position you would win. reply",

I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently.

Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

          "text": "I'm not a lawyer but have talked to a few founders who faced similar situations, ie. employee breaks the law or there's a substantial breach of ethics. 1) Document your case and speak to your lawyer. Pray they didn't do anything that would affect your customers/clients that could cause legal issues for you. I assume you're reviewing all their communications. 2) In most cases for early-stage companies, it's probably not worth it financially to pursue the case. It'll end up eating a lot of time, energy, and money that could've gone elsewhere. In the very least, documenting your case and throwing out some low-cost tactics could be useful for defensive purposes. 3) The priority at this point, I assume, is to re-establish your sales op. I would reach out to your professional networks and let them know not to work with this individual. Recruit your investors' networks as well, if any. The goal is to find good ways to protect yourself and your friends/partners. 4) Use the crisis to rally the team! You've been debuffed all this time! Turn this into a gift. 5) This sort of stuff happens all the time in one form or another. And it'll happen again. Anecdotally, I've found that it's happening more now with remote work where it's just harder to vet people. And if you're working cross-cultures, it can be even more difficult. Don't beat yourself up too much and learn from it. Good luck! reply",

I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases.

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass.

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI.

          "text": "First, I wouldn't give up on the work relationships.  Even if you damaged them, it's good practice and good karma to try to make amends; people really appreciate others reforming, and they will take you seriously as a person if you do.  And even if they balk, you tried, and you can leave with clean hands and new life lessons.   But most of all, the regularity of work and home is a good basis for making other life changes.  Unemployment changes economic and social and perhaps home context, making it mostly a time to hold things constant to balance the equation; any change is more forced than elected.  Better to hold employment but start changing what you want. Ok, not to duck the hypothetical, assuming you do leave (and to add to the other good advice here)... We tend to focus on the things we can control, and things we understand; we stay in a context.  A job change is a chance not to be stuck in that mode. The biggest difference in work latitude is the overall need and value flow.  It's just easier to be on a big river than a tiny stream, modulo competition.  So consider the world in terms on value-flow and competition.  E.g., tech value flows can be large but volatile, and competition includes outsourcing and automation on top of new grads.  In-person health care services require long credentialing but then are protected by those credentials and the difficulty of automation; but because it's in-person, the value is hard to scale unless you're a rainmaker (i.e., a doctor).  And so on. A job change is also a chance to reset your life.  Yes, try exercise and address some other self- and social-debt, but don't load yourself with obligations.  The key thing is values, how you feel, and your liveliness relative to life.  It'd be a good sign when there's a nice view, and you really feel it, without distraction from your psycho-social-economic context.  When you discover your values, you pretty naturally start working on them and work isn't hard. reply",

I feel like so many people younger than me have accomplished much more. Also disillusioned with corporate tech and deleted my LinkedIn.  I hate networking and my only network is my (actually quite) extensive and good college network. I'm actually great at interviews generally though I've become less confident over time as I don't have many impressive achievements to brag about and the longer your career goes on and you've just \"made websites and apps\" every year the harder it is to defend increasingly senior positions. Also feeling burnt out and I consider myself a generalist with no amazingly specific skills.  Mostly js/ts, web dev, react.  Basically the most common shit, I know it best, so nothing makes me stand out. I don't have any advice, just wanted to share you're not alone in feeling these things. reply",

          "text": "I went through this exact trajectory last year. Mid-40s with added weight of having a family as a sole earner, and feeling burnout for the first time in my life. Things to do before you leave your current job:\n- make LinkedIn connections with all your co-workers. Generally co-workers accept those, even if they don't think you're great. The reason for this is to increase your number of \"1st/2nd/3rd connections\" on LinkedIn. Which likely doesn't matter, but hey why not.\n- Depending on where you live, you may be able to get unemployment if you quit or fired but not the other way around. So figure that out, as well as what health care looks like for you and plan accordingly.\n- Update your resume with your current projects etc. if you haven't done that lately. Now once you are free of your current job, don't do any coding for a few months. No interview prep, no learning AI, none of it. Exercise and eat right, as others have said. Have a routine and maybe explore those 2 non-tech things. But give yourself a calendar and come back to things after you've let the burnout fade a bit. Don't rush back after a month because you start to get anxious - your body physically needs to recover. At this point, like it our not, I'd spend time getting comfortable with Cursor and vibe coding tools. Build a thing, see how it works, play around. You won't be able to avoid AI so see how it can help you with what you already know how to do and where it can't help. If you suck at interviews and leet coding, don't worry about it. Take some interviews, bomb them. The goal is to develop a thicker skin, which is the first step. Also, if a company's hiring culture is steeped in crap you hate, you will probably hate the job anyway. If they as you to do a weekend project, prefer to do that. That is likely where you will shine. Plus, it is a good way to practice when unemployed. Lastly, lean into your strengths - generalists and graybeards tend to be great at startups because they can pump things out and understand the big picture. Look for roles on sites like WellFound rather than LinkedIn. If you use LinkedIn, really only jobs through recruiters bear fruit nowadays. reply",

          "text": "My experience is that sending out CVs and searching for job postings didn't yield any results in my case. All the recruitment processes I've been through came from someone finding my LinkedIn profile and reaching out with a job offer. So, if you have general skills but lack specialized ones, I think the best approach is to tailor your profile to specific job offers and wait for someone to contact you. I've never done more than 1 profile myself because I have just one strong skill —good knowledge of SQL Server — and my profile is built around that. If I had more skills, I wouldn't list them all, instead, I'd precisely target specific job postings. Besides SQL Server, I obviously know the basics of other things and have decent general IT knowledge, but I don't mention those skills on my CV or LinkedIn at all. Simply treat your profile and CV like you're optimizing a website for SEO, targeting specific keywords. That's my advice. Imagine an average recruiter from a foreign country looking for candidates for a specific position. Make your profile in a way that, first, it appears in their suggestions (through the algorithm/keywords), and second, when they visit it, even without deep IT knowledge, they can easily see that you're a fitting candidate for the role they're trying to fill. reply",

          "text": "From my own personal experience with burnout, what I learnt was that life isn’t linear, and no matter how hard you work to make it feel that it is, your dharma will humble you in some way shape or form.  \nOur society falls drastically short on helping us deal with the actualities of life, or even worst, society deceives us, and as a result we can feel stranded, and have little in our toolbox to navigate through the harder times. I learnt that sacrifice was a necessary part of life. Giving up substantial money working a full time job to pursue my own business and health goals. 5 years later, I still have to make that sacrifice as many companies only hire FTE, but thats the price I will pay for my freedom. The financial sacrifice has been considerable, but thats just how it is, and thats OK, because what I get in return is greater; self-determination, flexibility, spontaneity, opportunity, and best of all, I get to build stuff that actually interests me. The other thing I got in return is the ability to challenge myself in the most optimal way possible to advance my skills and grow as a person. A comfy webdev job is an insidious way to atrophy the body, mind and spirit. The reality is, had I not changed path, I probably would be still burnt out so I didn't really have a choice in the matter, the signs were so obvious you’d have to have your head in the sand to ignore them! I remember the weakness I felt, waking up so exhausted, frail, like an old man! Thats no way to live. Some more actionable advice: 1. I have pretty intense ADHD, and I certainly don't fit the corporate mould. Neurodivergence can be a gift if you can wield it.\nI get hyperfocus from my work (I did 14h today, and would have done more if my partner hadn't stopped me), it fits in with entrepreneurship for sure. 2. Consistent Exercise is one of the most crucial things I learnt to do. It literally changed my life and lifted me (no pun intended) out of my burnout, depression and addictions. I started going to the gym 3-4 times a week, hitting the 90deg sauna afterwards. I never liked gyms or that culture, so this really says a lot. I cant emphasise enough how much this helped me. 3. Don't be afraid of letting go if what you are holding onto makes you miserable. Trust in yourself. Good luck. Feel free to dm me if you want to talk more. reply",

          "text": "Visit Silicon Valley for a month or 2. 0. Go to lots and lots of meetups and related tech conferences/community meetings. 1. Hang out in coffee shops around after lunch and after normal work business hours in Silicon Valley including Red Rock and ones in SF. This is when people are most likely to be hustling on side projects. 2. Talk to strangers with laptops. Notes: i. Whenever you meet people, exchange first/last name + phone + email. The easiest way post-Bump shutdown is to create a QR barcode in VCF encoding containing your name, email, and phone number. This is even better than a business card because it works with every smartphone without an app. I taped one to the back of my slim magsafe wallet. ii. Write a personalized (not ChatGPT) greeting/thank you email to everyone you make contact with the day of or the day after. If jobs oppy's don't find you, launch a consulting business. A US LLC is cheap and getting a business bank account is easy, and makes it so megacorps can hire you and pay your company in a manner that looks official. Moreover, one of the best paths forward for stable happiness would be a company in the form of a worker-owned co-op who do consultingish things, have subscribers, and sell/license products. Megacorps will always let you down just as soon as the market softens. A very small but talented band of creatives, coders, business, and sales people can create opportunities by delivering excellent value for their customers. reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "> It seems there is no standard proper way to store private keys. The gold standard for this would be a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is essentially a device that stores private keys with certain guarantees of physical security (e.g, that private key material cannot be extracted from the device once it has been generated or placed there, and the device performs operations using the key material on behalf of some client). HSMs in various forms underpin all sorts of cryptosystems that society depends on, because securing private key material at rest is essential. You'll find them everywhere from your debit/credit card, to certificate authorities, financial institutions, defense, and your smartphone. For your use case, I'd recommend taking a look at Yubikeys. I did a writeup a while back on how to use them to store different types of private keys for various purposes: https://blog.ctis.me/2022/12/yubikey-piv-gpg/ reply",

Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

If it's a task, I'll use * instead of - for the bullet marker (then move the task to my separate task tracker later - notes doc isn't good for long-term task management) If I want to tag the note explicitly with a \"tag\", I'll add one in brackets - but honestly these aren't that helpful. Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around. Pay a lot of attention to yourself when you're looking for historical information: what do you search for?  Are there key things you often look up over and over?

Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

When I encounter something worth saving, I simply create a new entry.

For example, if I discover an interesting React library, I create a new entry like this: https://i.imgur.com/dDlStkZ.png A great feature is that Logseq understands page hierarchies, so if I click on [[Dev/JS]], it presents a clear hierarchical overview: https://i.imgur.com/z9hGmmh.png Using this approach, I've stopped bookmarking sites in my browser altogether. In Logseq, I can connect useful things to each other, add entire notes, and more, as shown here: https://i.imgur.com/Krld2cS.png If I want to remember something, I just add a #card tag to the block, and it automatically syncs with Anki via a plugin. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

I capture everything from technical deep dives to random thoughts I find valuable, so I can revisit them later without cluttering my immediate workspace. This way, I can close all tabs at the end of the day without worrying about losing context or forgetting something important. It also helps me spot patterns in what I’m learning over time, which is surprisingly motivating. reply",

At the moment, I can save markdown notes, websites, files, anything, and it shows everything in a nice grid view while also generating AI summaries, like TLDR and keywords (which I can then search for.)

          "text": "For one thing a lot of tools like Excel do unwanted data transformations,  such as importing from a CSV they try to guess whether text is meant to be a string or a number and sometimes guess wrong.  You can spend a lot of time disabling this behavior or preventing it or fixing it up afterwards,  but frequently bad data just plain corrupts the analysis or target system. You can't really trust the time handling functions on any platform which is some  of the reason why languages like Python, and Java, might have two or three libraries for working with dates and times in the standard library because people realized the old one was unfixable.  Plenty of Javascript date handling libraries have told people \"look,  this is obsolete,  it's time to move on\" not just because that's the Javascript way,  but because the libraries really were error prone. In a real programming language it's straightforward to fix those problems,  in a fake programming language it is difficult or impossible. If you've got a strange index structure in the source or destination data, for instance, many tools fall down.  For instance if you want to convert nested set trees https://blog.uniauth.com/nested-set-model to something more normal like an adjacency list (or vice versa) a lot of simple tools are going to fall down. reply",

My main thoughts on where it could be improved, or where I see potential struggles, are when: - People aren't comfortable or familiar with coding/Python.\n  - You get into more complex imports like historical data, transactional data, etc. There you might have like 15 transaction types that have to be mapped, all with different fields, math, and conditional logic where the requirements become too much for just prompting ChatGPT effectively, and iterating on the Python can get pretty involved.\n  - The source data structure and transformation needs aren't consistently the same, leading to a lot of 'throwaway' or heavily modified scripts for each unique case.\n  - Tasks like VLOOKUPs or enriching data come into play, which might add manual coding or complexity beyond a simple 1-to-1 source-to-destination script. These are the areas where I'm exploring if a more structured way could offer benefits in terms of repeatability and accessibility for a wider range of users or complex scenarios. Appreciate the insight into your process and your thoughts on this. reply",

          "text": "I transform hundreds of tabular sources. For the cleaning / transformation, I found that a very small number of transformations is required, and that we need to review them as a team including business owners. So, I wrote a simple grammar that is very English-like; that gets translated into Polars operations under the covers in Python. It covers 98% + of my ingestion needs, and means that we focus on the needs of the logical data transformations as a team. Business users can easily make changes for sources they manage. One of the concepts is a “map”, for old values to new values. Those we keep in Excel in Git, so that business users can edit / maintain them. Being Excel, we’re careful to validate the import of those rules when we do a run, mainly to indicate where there’s been a lot of change to identify where there might be an unintended change. Excel makes me nervous in data processing work in general (exploration with Pivots is great, though I’ve moved to Visidata as my first tool of choice). But for years of running in this way we’ve worked around Excel lax approach to data, such as interpreting numerical ID fields as numbers rather than strings. For output “rendering”, because everything is in Polars, we can most frequently simply output to CSV. We use Jinja for some funky cases. reply",

A stable identifier for each record, a parseable number format with clarity about US vs world conventies like , vs .  and a stable date format like ISO 8601.   Also a real structured format like json, xml, ...  works better than csv, which is better than xls(x) From there, it depends. If there is a lot of data and you need a quick estimate,   the POSIX toolset is a good choice: cut, grep, sed, jq, ... If there is a lot of data, reasonably structured, load it minimally parsed in an sql table as (line number,source id,line of text) and parse from there.  The database will auto parallelize. If the data is hard to parse, grab a real programming language.  You probably want something that can deal with character data quickly, e.g. Go Java Rust C# ....   Python or R work if the amount of data is low or you can lean heavily on things like numpy.  PHP, VBA,... tend to be slow and error prone. My experience with ETL tooling is it's eternally 90% there.  It should theoretically solve this, but I always seem to fall back on programming languages and fight the tools after a while. reply",

          "text": "This was roughly half my job a decade ago. Literally because I split my time 50/50 between two separate projects, one of which was a business analytics automation project that was designed for exactly this purpose. Take all of the data exported from the various project management and issue tracking systems used by different product teams, transform as necessary, then import to a common corporate analytics system upper management used to track progress metrics. The idea was to replace all of the bespoke custom Excel workflows that various program management teams used to do it themselves, so we were self-funding based on the estimated cost savings of replacing manual work, meaning I had pretty much free reign to do it however I wanted as long as I could get people to use it. I did it entirely in Python, making heavy use of Pandas, creating a toolchain that ingested mapping definitions from the users and relied on fuzzy matching (i.e. stemming, de-capitalization, recognizing word roots) to categorize field names into a common definition set used by the corporate system. It wasn't a 100% solution, more like 95%, but the reality of this kind of work is we had a real garbage-in problem anyway that no software could solve. Extracting data from an issue tracker relies upon developers using it correctly in the first place. If you have a bunch of workflow transitions but whoever works an issue just transitions them all at once when work is complete, there's no way to know how long everything actually took. You can only extract information that was actually recorded. Coercing dates into a single format standard is fairly simple to do, but if the dates were wrong in the original format, they'll still be wrong in the corrected format. reply",

Because of different needs of clients, I almost always have to modify the script, but less and less each time, and Cursor makes the edits pretty easy, as long as I review each proposed change and prevent it from getting the script.

          "text": "This is a major part of my job - we're a small team that works with close to 100 partners in the nonprofit sector, who all store similar data differently in CSV, PDFs, 2-3 industry-specific CRMs, etc. that we need to standardize and load. Our partners have small datasets (usually <2000 rows, maybe 20 columns or so), that are most of the time is extremely poorly formatted. We work in a single domain, so each partner's data is largely a different formatted version of the same common elements. We have a template with accompanying documentation - partners with technical teams and well-structured data can basically self-serve with SQL. We have a series of meetings where we map columns and values, review errors, etc. More irritating than the data transformations is understanding the structure of the data and practical use, e.g., the same column for Partner A means something entirely different for Partner B. Transforming it might not be the problem - making sure everyone across our teams understands what it means and where it should go is a large pain point in mapping, but the coding of this logic is trivial. For non-technical partners where we handle the prep, over time I wrote a small internal Python library just building off DataFrames that contains a few hundred tests to validate the data, plus a set of commonly used data cleaning functions that are flexible in their inputs. We connect to APIs to verify addresses, time zones, where we can. We now use LLMs more frequently to parse and structure fields to our standard, but it is still painful to review results from the LLM and ensure correctness. Each incoming file will result in an accompanying Jupyter notebook that runs all the relevant scripts. Issue with working Excel (formulas, Office JS/PY Scripts, manual edits) has always been version tracking - difficult to replicate work if new versions of files come in while we are prepping the data. If we find an error post-import, it is great to be able to track down where and why we made the decision or coding error. I haven't tried Power Query though. I have tried OpenRefine, but I think sometimes it slows me down for easy functions, and API-based data transformations becoming a separate task. When we have interns, coordinating cleaning / prep on a single file across users can be tricky. We did try an internal POC of a UI based tool to allow users to map their own data, start cleaning it, but honestly, either a) the partner would have a data analyst or steward that didn't need it, or b) the partner wouldn't have enough of a skillset to feel comfortable cleaning it. Plus pretty often we'll need to join data from multiple spreadsheets, but conditionally use certain rows from one or the other to get the most up-to-date data, which can be difficult to do. Didn't feel as if this was worth the effort to continue with. Fuzzy de-duplication validation is a pain, or anything where you actually want to check with the partner about its correctness - like if I notice that an email is spelled correctly because it almost matches the person's last name, but 1 letter different - becomes a long list of bullet points in an email. Something I would like is an easy way to flag and share errors and have a partner correct those in a friendly UI, then store those changes as code, without a long series of emails or meetings. We've a few times had an Excel file uploaded to Sharepoint, then with a script that automatically adds a comment to cells with errors -> but again, some people just aren't comfortable working with Excel, or get confused when they see a very structured version of their data with additional formatting, and there is no convenient way to track or replicate their changes. There are always also one-off corrections that will need to be made as well - I've just sort of accepted this, and so we generate a list of warnings / recommendations for the partner to review or correct post-import based on the test results rather that us trying to do it. That has worked fine. reply",

          "text": "Wow, thanks for the detailed and insightful breakdown of your process. This really resonates a lot of the complexities I've been exploring and encountered as an implementation consultant. A few things particularly stood out to me: - Your point about semantic mapping (\"understanding the structure... what it means and where it should go\") being more irritating than the actual coding of transformations is spot on. Domain expertise on these things can make a big difference.\n\n  - The version tracking issues with Excel and the need to trace back decisions or errors are a big reason Excel isn't scalable. I totally agree with you and think Excel is bad for this kind of stuff and repeatable transformations/processes are important.\n  - Your desire for an easier way to flag/share errors with partners for correction and then effectively store those changes as part of a repeatable process (like 'code' or a versioned configuration) is a fascinating challenge in collaborative data onboarding. It seems crucial for those fixes to not be one-offs especially when dealing with partners/clients which are notoriously slow. I've used Flatfile in the past, but its limiting in that its all about one-offs and transformations aren't repeated. It sounds like you've built a robust internal Python library to manage a lot of this, which is impressive. When you use Jupyter notebooks for each incoming file: - How do you manage the reusability of common logic or tests across those notebooks, especially if a core cleaning function needs an update that should apply to many different partner files?\n  - And how do less technical team members (like the interns you mentioned) interact with or contribute to that Python/notebook-based process, particularly if they need to understand or slightly modify a transformation rule? And for your usage of LLM, is that mostly for mapping source field to target fields? Thanks again for sharing such a comprehensive view, it's incredibly helpful for understanding the friction points and the need for traceable, repeatable solutions. reply",

          "text": "Course! These are one-time migrations, so at most we have 3-4 projects happening concurrently and don't need to worry about backwards compatibility either. We can just import a specific version or branch of the library, or at worst,  we just copy and paste the function and make the change in the notebook. But a majority of the functions we've put work into in the library are really the consistently applied across any incoming data files - API scripts, de-duplication, assigning IDs... honestly any changes like this are usually pretty easy to make. The tests are always consistent across files and primarily check for the validity of the upload (right type, for example, or logic (start times have end times, etc.). Every test should work for every file ever, since those are based on the platform and upload constraints rather than partner data. Short answer is they don't. For onboarding interns into the process, I write a skeleton notebook that imports the internal library and walks them through cleaning a file. But we would hire for interns that have background in coding and data cleaning. Starting out, rather than change a existing function, they might add a line of code in the notebook that changes the data in a way that the existing function would now work, for example. There are cases where specific-business logic needs to be coded into a function, but we would just write those ad-hoc. This isn't an upload that needs to be done automatically or very quickly, so that hasn't been a problem. The only reason other team members would contribute to this would be around shaping the business logic of which fields should be uploaded where and how they should be formatted, etc. But that data review part that sometimes needs to be done is very tricky, e.g., checking that the transformed results are what they want. It mostly happens in Excel - we did build a POC UI where they would upload a CSV, and they could click through each record and review and suggest changes in a cleaner way. For LLMs, we don't use them for mapping, but we've tested it and it works fine. The LLM mapping doesn't really save us a ton of time compared to us just looking through the file and assigning columns in our mapping file (which is composed of about 120 columns). If we wanted to deploy it and allow the partner to upload a sheet and the LLM to suggest a mapping, that could work. (The mapping step in the demo video on your site looks great!) Instead we use them to format and extract unstructured data -> for example, we might need to pull tags out of descriptive text, or extract event hours out of a string of text describing the event. The LLM can do this really well now with structured JSON outputs, but reviewing it to ensure it is correct is still a manual process. reply",

          "text": "Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. Not across the network. RabbitMQ is neat out of the box. But I went with ZeroMQ at the time. ZeroMQ is cool but during current year I'd only use it to learn from their excellent documentation. Coming from Python, it taught me about Berkeley sockets and the process of building cross-language messaging patterns. After a few projects, it's like realizing I didn't need ZeroMQ to begin with I could make my own! If ZeroMQ's Hintjens were still with us I'd still be using it. It's like the documented incremental process of designing a messaging queue to fit your problem domain, plus a thin wrapper easing some of lower level socket nastiness. At least that's my experience using it over the years. Me talking about it won't do it enough justice. NATS does the lower level socket wrapper part very nicely. It's a but more modern too. Golang's designed to be like a slightly nicer C syntax, so it would make sense that it's high performance and sturdy. So it's similar to ZeroMQ there. I'm not sure if either persist to disk out of the box. So either of these are going to be simpler and faster than Kafka. The DB people are probably trying too hard to cater to the queues. Ideally I'd have normalized the data and modeled the relations such transactions don't lock up the whole table. Then I started questioning why I needed a queue at all when databases (sans SQLite which is fast enough as is) are made for pooling access to a database. Kafka supports pipelining to a relational database but this part is where you kind of have to be experienced to not footgun and I'm not at that level. I think using it as a queue in that you're short-circuiting it from the relational database pipeline is non-standard for Kafka. I suspect that's where a lot of the Kafka hate is from. I could understand if the distributed transactions part is hell but at that point it's like why'd you skip the database then? Trying to get that free lunch I assume. I have an alternative. Try inserting everything into a SQLite file. Running into concurrency issues? Use a second SQLite file. Two computers? send it over the network. More issues? Since it's SQL just switch to a real database that will pool the clients. Or switch to five of them. SQL is sorta cool that way. I assume that would avoid the reimplementing half of the JVM to sync across computers where you get Oracle Java showing up to sell you their database halfway into making your galactic scale software or the whatever. I must be stressed today. Thanks for asking. reply",

Persistence was also unnecessary as the data stream already had a separate archiving system and existing clients only needed about 24hr max of context. AWS Kinesis ended up being simpler for our needs and I have nothing but good things to say about it for the most part.

Its typically being consumed by some job system polling on an interval and then doing CRUD to sync changes. Its not very complex and feels like we're running a lot of compute resources to just sync data between systems. Admittedly there isn't good separation of concerns so there is overlap that requires data syncs. I've been looking at things like kafka, etc. thinking there might be some magic there that makes us use less compute or makes data syncs a little easier to deal with but wonder what scale of data throughput is a tipping point where a service like that is really needed. If it turns out its just a different service but same timeliness of data sync and similar compute resources I struggle with what benefits might be provided. I'd love for almost like a levels.fyi style site where people could anonymously report things like this for the tech stacks being used, throughput of data, amount of compute in play, and ratings/comments on their overall solution (\"would do again\", \"don't recommend\", \"overkill\", \"resume filler\").  It feels much like other areas of technology where a use case comes out of a huge company and RDD (resume driven development) takes hold and now there are people out there doing the equivalent of souping up a 1997 honda accord like its a racecar but its only driving grandma to her appointments. reply",

          "text": "I would highlight a distinction between Queues and Streams, as I think this is an important factor in making this choice. In the case of a queue, you put an item in the queue, and then something removes it later. There is a single flow of items. They are put in. They are taken out. In the case of a stream, you put an item in the queue, then it can be removed multiple times by any other process that cares to do so. This may be called 'fan out'. This is an important distinction and really effects how one designs software that uses these systems. Queues work just fine for, say, background jobs. A user signs up, and you put a task in the 'send_registration_email' queue.[1] However, what if some _other_ system then cares about user sign ups? Well, you have to add another queue, and the user sign-up code needs to be aware of it. For example, a 'add_user_to_crm' queue. The result here is that choosing a queue early on leads to a tight-coupling of services down the road. The alternative is to choose streams. In this case, instead of saying what _should_ happen, you say what _did_ happen (past tense). Here you replace 'send_registration_email' and 'add_user_to_crm' with a single stream called 'used_registered'. Each service that cares about this fact is then free to subscribe to that steam and get its own copy of the events (it does so via a 'consumer group', or something of a similar name). This results in a more loosely coupled system, where you potentially also have access to an event history should you need it (if you configure your broker to keep the events around). -- This is where Postgresql and SQS tend to fall down. I've yet to hear of an implementation of streams in Postgresql[2]. And SQS is inherently a queue. I therefore normally reach for Redis Steams, but mostly because it is what I am familiar with. Note: This line of thinking leads into Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. Each of which is interesting and certainly has useful things to offer, although I would advise against simply consuming any of them wholesale. [1] Although this is my go-to example, I'm actually unconvinced that email sending should be done via a queue. Email is just a sequence of queues anyway.

But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "I think you are asking the right question here. Before building something determine if there is a market, and if that market will pay. Personally my gut says no. I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm more interested in multi-use simple tools. For example, an app that solves a common small problem/inconvenience really well is probably worth $5/mo (I would probably pay for that), but I can't imagine anyone just buys subscriptions to indie apps haha. I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

We sent them to various regions across Germany, but my guess is they ended up in a pile at the campground reception and never reached the actual owners. That said, we manually scraped around 500 campgrounds near us, designed postcards that highlighted CloudCamping’s key selling points, and sent them out using a different mailing service. Since we didn’t hear back from anyone specifically mentioning the postcards, I assume they didn’t convince anyone in the end. Still, it was a fun experiment, and who knows, it might work better in a different context! reply",

Without fail the creators happen to haha stumble in and happily take your feedback.

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

It's an app/website blocker for iPhone & Mac, so I focused on relevant communities like r/digitalminimalism and r/dumbphones with genuine, non-spammy posts: https://www.atten.app I also tried \"apps gone free\" campaigns by posting on Reddit and using sites like AppRaven. These were very effective for visibility, the launch is currently the #5 all-time post on r/macapps ( https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/top/?t=all ). While these campaigns drove a strong spike in downloads, retention was low, so they weren’t as useful for building a long-term user base. reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases.

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water. It understands what I want to do next about 95% of the time when I'm in the middle of something, including comprehensive multi-line/multi-file changes.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

Normally, I add the required files, change to architect or ask mode (depends on the problem I want to solve), explain what my problem is and how I want it to be solved. If the Aider answer satisfies me, I change to coding mode and allow the changes. No magic, I have no idea how a single prompt can generate $4. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm only scratching on the surface with my approach though, maybe there is a better but more costly strategy yielding better results which I just didn't realize yet. reply",

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass.

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI.

I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently. Shouldn't be a problem, if the business is \"real\". I want to stress, that I am only a customer, no partner or affiliate or receive any benefit of writing this. reply",

And when the domain expires there is usually [1] a period afterwards when it can be retrieved before anyone else can buy it. Set the domain to auto-renew, make sure the registrar has your payment details, set calendar reminders. Its not difficult. The alternative is gmail or similar, where you can lose access to your email, and perhaps the root of your digital \"identity\", at the whim of some hair-trigger algorithm [2] and be left unable to even communicate with the provider to get it fixed. So get a domain from a decent registrar. Pay several years in advance. Keep your payment and contact details up to date.

Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

          "text": "> It seems there is no standard proper way to store private keys. The gold standard for this would be a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is essentially a device that stores private keys with certain guarantees of physical security (e.g, that private key material cannot be extracted from the device once it has been generated or placed there, and the device performs operations using the key material on behalf of some client). HSMs in various forms underpin all sorts of cryptosystems that society depends on, because securing private key material at rest is essential. You'll find them everywhere from your debit/credit card, to certificate authorities, financial institutions, defense, and your smartphone. For your use case, I'd recommend taking a look at Yubikeys. I did a writeup a while back on how to use them to store different types of private keys for various purposes: https://blog.ctis.me/2022/12/yubikey-piv-gpg/ reply",

I've kept everything that didn't die in sudden catastrophic failures.\nI can access files that I got before there was even a harddrive in my computer.\nAnd I love it, like browsing an old photo album, I once in a while take a stroll through my life, but, unlike the photo, which only captures one angle of a situation, I have entire installations to look at, what was on my desktop 20 years ago, what had I downloaded, oh, that movie, yeah, I remember it now! those funny pictures a long-forgotten friend send to me over IRC DCC, the chatlogs of our cringe teenage banter.. Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

The often cited study is [3] which shows longform writing to be more beneficial - it also comes to this conclusion: \"Although more notes are beneficial, at least to a point, if the notes are taken indiscriminately or by mindlessly transcribing content, as is more likely the case on a lap-top than when notes are taken longhand, the benefit dis-appears.\" There was a follow-up study made (see [1], [2]) that showed it made no difference in the end. It's what you do with it afterwards that really matters. Long story short? One form is not more superior to other, but I find typed text (in a digital document) easier to manipulate, transfer to other tools (i.e. Anki) and less friction when I'm thinking as I type. --- [1] https://www.themantic-education.com/ibpsych/2023/01/20/note-...

Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around. Pay a lot of attention to yourself when you're looking for historical information: what do you search for?  Are there key things you often look up over and over?

Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

It will auto-analyze anything that I have saved, generate AI summaries, keywords and have an article reader built right into it. It will then send me emails about the things that I have saved recently and how they are all connected. You are welcome to try it and share anything feedback that you may have. At the moment, I can save markdown notes, websites, files, anything, and it shows everything in a nice grid view while also generating AI summaries, like TLDR and keywords (which I can then search for.) I will try to add those features / fix those bugs that you suggest. :) https://sunchay.com reply",

          "text": "For one thing a lot of tools like Excel do unwanted data transformations,  such as importing from a CSV they try to guess whether text is meant to be a string or a number and sometimes guess wrong.  You can spend a lot of time disabling this behavior or preventing it or fixing it up afterwards,  but frequently bad data just plain corrupts the analysis or target system. You can't really trust the time handling functions on any platform which is some  of the reason why languages like Python, and Java, might have two or three libraries for working with dates and times in the standard library because people realized the old one was unfixable.  Plenty of Javascript date handling libraries have told people \"look,  this is obsolete,  it's time to move on\" not just because that's the Javascript way,  but because the libraries really were error prone. In a real programming language it's straightforward to fix those problems,  in a fake programming language it is difficult or impossible. If you've got a strange index structure in the source or destination data, for instance, many tools fall down.  For instance if you want to convert nested set trees https://blog.uniauth.com/nested-set-model to something more normal like an adjacency list (or vice versa) a lot of simple tools are going to fall down. reply",

My main thoughts on where it could be improved, or where I see potential struggles, are when: - People aren't comfortable or familiar with coding/Python.\n  - You get into more complex imports like historical data, transactional data, etc. There you might have like 15 transaction types that have to be mapped, all with different fields, math, and conditional logic where the requirements become too much for just prompting ChatGPT effectively, and iterating on the Python can get pretty involved.\n  - The source data structure and transformation needs aren't consistently the same, leading to a lot of 'throwaway' or heavily modified scripts for each unique case.\n  - Tasks like VLOOKUPs or enriching data come into play, which might add manual coding or complexity beyond a simple 1-to-1 source-to-destination script. These are the areas where I'm exploring if a more structured way could offer benefits in terms of repeatability and accessibility for a wider range of users or complex scenarios.

It covers 98% + of my ingestion needs, and means that we focus on the needs of the logical data transformations as a team. Business users can easily make changes for sources they manage. One of the concepts is a “map”, for old values to new values. Those we keep in Excel in Git, so that business users can edit / maintain them.

But for years of running in this way we’ve worked around Excel lax approach to data, such as interpreting numerical ID fields as numbers rather than strings.

Also a real structured format like json, xml, ...  works better than csv, which is better than xls(x) From there, it depends. If there is a lot of data and you need a quick estimate,   the POSIX toolset is a good choice: cut, grep, sed, jq, ... If there is a lot of data, reasonably structured, load it minimally parsed in an sql table as (line number,source id,line of text) and parse from there.  The database will auto parallelize. If the data is hard to parse, grab a real programming language.  You probably want something that can deal with character data quickly, e.g. Go Java Rust C# ....   Python or R work if the amount of data is low or you can lean heavily on things like numpy.  PHP, VBA,... tend to be slow and error prone. My experience with ETL tooling is it's eternally 90% there.  It should theoretically solve this, but I always seem to fall back on programming languages and fight the tools after a while. reply",

          "text": "This was roughly half my job a decade ago. Literally because I split my time 50/50 between two separate projects, one of which was a business analytics automation project that was designed for exactly this purpose. Take all of the data exported from the various project management and issue tracking systems used by different product teams, transform as necessary, then import to a common corporate analytics system upper management used to track progress metrics. The idea was to replace all of the bespoke custom Excel workflows that various program management teams used to do it themselves, so we were self-funding based on the estimated cost savings of replacing manual work, meaning I had pretty much free reign to do it however I wanted as long as I could get people to use it. I did it entirely in Python, making heavy use of Pandas, creating a toolchain that ingested mapping definitions from the users and relied on fuzzy matching (i.e. stemming, de-capitalization, recognizing word roots) to categorize field names into a common definition set used by the corporate system. It wasn't a 100% solution, more like 95%, but the reality of this kind of work is we had a real garbage-in problem anyway that no software could solve. Extracting data from an issue tracker relies upon developers using it correctly in the first place. If you have a bunch of workflow transitions but whoever works an issue just transitions them all at once when work is complete, there's no way to know how long everything actually took. You can only extract information that was actually recorded. Coercing dates into a single format standard is fairly simple to do, but if the dates were wrong in the original format, they'll still be wrong in the corrected format. reply",

Right now the most relevant mapping process I have to do is taking Amazon product data and transforming it to a Shopify upload csv. The largest of these is around 20k rows, so nothing crazy. There are apps that do this via APIs, but at a large enough scale, they are not reliable. The process takes around 10 hours, with the help of a VA who does the lower level cleaning stuff. I made a bare bones spreadsheet with under 10 columns, which makes it much easier to work with the data. Once I'm satisfied, I run it through a python script, which turns it into a Shopify conforming csv. Because of different needs of clients, I almost always have to modify the script, but less and less each time, and Cursor makes the edits pretty easy, as long as I review each proposed change and prevent it from getting the script. Good thing about cursor is that it can run its own tests against the input csv in agent mode and debug autonomously. reply",

          "text": "This is a major part of my job - we're a small team that works with close to 100 partners in the nonprofit sector, who all store similar data differently in CSV, PDFs, 2-3 industry-specific CRMs, etc. that we need to standardize and load. Our partners have small datasets (usually <2000 rows, maybe 20 columns or so), that are most of the time is extremely poorly formatted. We work in a single domain, so each partner's data is largely a different formatted version of the same common elements. We have a template with accompanying documentation - partners with technical teams and well-structured data can basically self-serve with SQL. We have a series of meetings where we map columns and values, review errors, etc. More irritating than the data transformations is understanding the structure of the data and practical use, e.g., the same column for Partner A means something entirely different for Partner B. Transforming it might not be the problem - making sure everyone across our teams understands what it means and where it should go is a large pain point in mapping, but the coding of this logic is trivial. For non-technical partners where we handle the prep, over time I wrote a small internal Python library just building off DataFrames that contains a few hundred tests to validate the data, plus a set of commonly used data cleaning functions that are flexible in their inputs. We connect to APIs to verify addresses, time zones, where we can. We now use LLMs more frequently to parse and structure fields to our standard, but it is still painful to review results from the LLM and ensure correctness. Each incoming file will result in an accompanying Jupyter notebook that runs all the relevant scripts. Issue with working Excel (formulas, Office JS/PY Scripts, manual edits) has always been version tracking - difficult to replicate work if new versions of files come in while we are prepping the data. If we find an error post-import, it is great to be able to track down where and why we made the decision or coding error. I haven't tried Power Query though. I have tried OpenRefine, but I think sometimes it slows me down for easy functions, and API-based data transformations becoming a separate task. When we have interns, coordinating cleaning / prep on a single file across users can be tricky. We did try an internal POC of a UI based tool to allow users to map their own data, start cleaning it, but honestly, either a) the partner would have a data analyst or steward that didn't need it, or b) the partner wouldn't have enough of a skillset to feel comfortable cleaning it. Plus pretty often we'll need to join data from multiple spreadsheets, but conditionally use certain rows from one or the other to get the most up-to-date data, which can be difficult to do. Didn't feel as if this was worth the effort to continue with. Fuzzy de-duplication validation is a pain, or anything where you actually want to check with the partner about its correctness - like if I notice that an email is spelled correctly because it almost matches the person's last name, but 1 letter different - becomes a long list of bullet points in an email. Something I would like is an easy way to flag and share errors and have a partner correct those in a friendly UI, then store those changes as code, without a long series of emails or meetings. We've a few times had an Excel file uploaded to Sharepoint, then with a script that automatically adds a comment to cells with errors -> but again, some people just aren't comfortable working with Excel, or get confused when they see a very structured version of their data with additional formatting, and there is no convenient way to track or replicate their changes. There are always also one-off corrections that will need to be made as well - I've just sort of accepted this, and so we generate a list of warnings / recommendations for the partner to review or correct post-import based on the test results rather that us trying to do it. That has worked fine. reply",

          "text": "Wow, thanks for the detailed and insightful breakdown of your process. This really resonates a lot of the complexities I've been exploring and encountered as an implementation consultant. A few things particularly stood out to me: - Your point about semantic mapping (\"understanding the structure... what it means and where it should go\") being more irritating than the actual coding of transformations is spot on. Domain expertise on these things can make a big difference.\n\n  - The version tracking issues with Excel and the need to trace back decisions or errors are a big reason Excel isn't scalable. I totally agree with you and think Excel is bad for this kind of stuff and repeatable transformations/processes are important.\n  - Your desire for an easier way to flag/share errors with partners for correction and then effectively store those changes as part of a repeatable process (like 'code' or a versioned configuration) is a fascinating challenge in collaborative data onboarding. It seems crucial for those fixes to not be one-offs especially when dealing with partners/clients which are notoriously slow. I've used Flatfile in the past, but its limiting in that its all about one-offs and transformations aren't repeated. It sounds like you've built a robust internal Python library to manage a lot of this, which is impressive. When you use Jupyter notebooks for each incoming file: - How do you manage the reusability of common logic or tests across those notebooks, especially if a core cleaning function needs an update that should apply to many different partner files?\n  - And how do less technical team members (like the interns you mentioned) interact with or contribute to that Python/notebook-based process, particularly if they need to understand or slightly modify a transformation rule? And for your usage of LLM, is that mostly for mapping source field to target fields? Thanks again for sharing such a comprehensive view, it's incredibly helpful for understanding the friction points and the need for traceable, repeatable solutions. reply",

          "text": "Course! These are one-time migrations, so at most we have 3-4 projects happening concurrently and don't need to worry about backwards compatibility either. We can just import a specific version or branch of the library, or at worst,  we just copy and paste the function and make the change in the notebook. But a majority of the functions we've put work into in the library are really the consistently applied across any incoming data files - API scripts, de-duplication, assigning IDs... honestly any changes like this are usually pretty easy to make. The tests are always consistent across files and primarily check for the validity of the upload (right type, for example, or logic (start times have end times, etc.). Every test should work for every file ever, since those are based on the platform and upload constraints rather than partner data. Short answer is they don't. For onboarding interns into the process, I write a skeleton notebook that imports the internal library and walks them through cleaning a file. But we would hire for interns that have background in coding and data cleaning. Starting out, rather than change a existing function, they might add a line of code in the notebook that changes the data in a way that the existing function would now work, for example. There are cases where specific-business logic needs to be coded into a function, but we would just write those ad-hoc. This isn't an upload that needs to be done automatically or very quickly, so that hasn't been a problem. The only reason other team members would contribute to this would be around shaping the business logic of which fields should be uploaded where and how they should be formatted, etc. But that data review part that sometimes needs to be done is very tricky, e.g., checking that the transformed results are what they want. It mostly happens in Excel - we did build a POC UI where they would upload a CSV, and they could click through each record and review and suggest changes in a cleaner way. For LLMs, we don't use them for mapping, but we've tested it and it works fine. The LLM mapping doesn't really save us a ton of time compared to us just looking through the file and assigning columns in our mapping file (which is composed of about 120 columns). If we wanted to deploy it and allow the partner to upload a sheet and the LLM to suggest a mapping, that could work. (The mapping step in the demo video on your site looks great!) Instead we use them to format and extract unstructured data -> for example, we might need to pull tags out of descriptive text, or extract event hours out of a string of text describing the event. The LLM can do this really well now with structured JSON outputs, but reviewing it to ensure it is correct is still a manual process. reply",

          "text": "I think the decline of FILE_ID.DIZ files is largely a byproduct of changing distribution methods. Back in the BBS and early FTP days, these small text files were crucial because they provided a quick summary for file archives, especially when bandwidth was limited, and you couldn't afford to waste time downloading the wrong file. With the rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, project descriptions and metadata have become more integrated. The README.md has essentially replaced FILE_ID.DIZ as the default \"project descriptor\", but with much more flexibility for formatting, linking, and even embedding media. Additionally, the way we discover and share software has changed. We now have package managers, app stores, and automatic metadata parsing tools that handle much of what these files used to do. Plus, we expect modern software to have much more comprehensive documentation than a few lines in a .DIZ file. reply",
