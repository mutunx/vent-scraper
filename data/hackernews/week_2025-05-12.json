          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water.

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

Its autocomplete feels better at 'looking ahead' and figuring out what I might be doing next, while Windsurf tends to focus more on repeating whatever I've done recently. Also, while Windsurf has more project awareness, and it's better at integrating things across files, actually trying to get it to read enough context to do so intelligently is like pulling teeth. Presumably this is a resource-saving measure but it often ends up taking more tokens when it needs to be redone. Overall Cursor 'just works' better IME. They both have free trials though so there's little reason not to try both and make a decision yourself. Also, Windsurf's pricing is lower (and they have a generous free tier) so if you're on a tight budget it's a good option. reply",

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop.

Sometimes it just fails to submit code changes. Which is especially bad as they charge you for every request. Also I think they over-charge for Gemini, and Gemini integration is especially poor. My reference for agent mode is Claude Code. It's far from perfect, but it uses sub-tasks and summarization using smaller haiku model. That feels way more like a coherent solution compared to Cursor. Also Aider ain't bad when you're OK with more manual process. Windsurf: Have only used it briefly, but agent mode seems somewhat better thought out. For example, they present possible next steps as buttons. Some reviews say it's even more expensive than Cursor in agent mode. reply",

Also Gemini less neurotic when I use it with very basic prompts -- either Cursor prompts make it worse, or the need to juggle tool calls distract it from calls. reply",

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

          "text": "Since this topic is closely related to my new project, I’d love to hear your opinion on it. I’m thinking of building an AI IDE that helps engineers write production quality code quickly when working with AI. The core idea is to introduce a new kind of collaboration workflow. You start with the same kind of prompt, like “I want to build this feature...”, but instead of the model making changes right away, it proposes an architecture for what it plans to do, shown from a bird’s-eye view in the 2D canvas. You collaborate with the AI on this architecture to ensure everything is built the way you want. You’re setting up data flows, structure, and validation checks. Once you’re satisfied with the design, you hit play, and the model writes the code.

I forget almost everything I know about building software and instead focus on memorizing tricks and optimizations and processes for solving leetcode algorithm questions. In my last interview, in an automated screener, they had 7 leetcode easy+mediums in 10 minutes each, with zero partial credit, only final tests passing. That's what companies want now, so that's what I have to deliver - I don't have a fucking choice. I look over system designs, try to understand what the core aspect is. For the most part I tend to pass those without as much of a problem. Nothing works best, but doing this has gotten me further than actually practicing and writing code. I have 8 YoE, took a career break on short term disability for burnout/early childhood horrors that I needed to deal with. Its 2 years later, I'm able to code again and am picking up things much faster than ever, but I'm about to lose my apartment and move into a friends basement because a career break is, apparently, career suicide right now, and even contract companies won't even interview me because of the career break. I was getting cold recruited by FAANG before. I just want the opportunity to work so I can have stable housing, and I'm doing everything I can. It gets harder and harder to practice. I consider whether my career was a sham all along often. I don't really care that this is venting, there's nobody to talk to about it. reply",

I actually worked on a lot of the front-end functionality (among other things) during my tenure there and we had 1 person who was essentially the UX lead (I'm sure the team / function has expanded since then).\n>\n> The design philosophy for the website was heavily influence by Edward Tufte and myself and several folks from my engineering team were enrolled in his course to familiarize ourselves with key concepts.\n>\n> When I interviewed with McMaster-Carr I distinctly remember a Director who told me about building the first version of the website himself and not realizing it would become \"a real thing\" one day. I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he was a sharp guy and I'm sure he's off doing great things. We walked into work one Monday morning, and his desk was empty and his whiteboard said \"poof\".

For my McMaster example, google gives 9 results, none of which are the McMaster site. That not specific enough? To be fair, I believe McMaster to be fairly protective of their catalog. At least their part numbers are fairly recognizable - they are usually about 10 characters long, all numbers, with an \"A\" near the end.

On the other hand, if you train people that if you want to use McMaster part numbers, you have to use the McMaster site... once you have a customer, as long as your site and inventory don't frustrate them, you have a customer for life.

Google and Facebook are highly lucrative because they designed a system where your profit margins (as a business) are largely sucked up by Google and Facebook by making you bid against your competitors at higher and higher values until someone is willing to give up almost all of their margins to be the top bidder for the favored “top spot”. Hypothetically, if you make $1 in profit on your product, theory says that some competitor will bid up to $0.99 to secure that sale and if you don’t bid this amount also, your sales will suffer. The end result is that Google and Facebook end up consuming all the profits for a large number of businesses online that have to survive by advertising, which explains Google’s immense profit margins. Assuming what you say is true, this is truly a ballsy move by McMaster. Betting that their website is unassailable by their competition and thus such a value-add that they can forgo playing the losing game that Google and Facebook has setup is brilliant. I have such respect for that. reply",

The filter/apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster's auto updating window. Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense. Want to buy a generic \"graphing calculator\" for $126 which is definitely not a Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus? Here you go! [1]. Look, you're not fooling anybody here.

          "text": "It's ok most of the time, but it's not like they sell McMaster branded stuff in McMaster packaging. They are a supplier, and might want to obfuscate to keep you from buying direct from the actual manufacturers. On the other hand, on my desk right now is a bag of springs, the info printed on it says it was made by WB Jones, part number 4011. We ordered it from McMaster. Why not? They stock the item and ship super quick. If I want another bag of the same springs, it's not like I can go to McMaster, type in \"springs 4011\" and expect to find it. Instead, I'll have to search up purchasing requests I've made, maybe ask a coworker if they ordered them, etc. to find the mcmaster number again. If I didn't know Mcmaster sold it to us, I'd have no idea they sold it at all. To be fair, if they sell things that are interchangeable, like screws, it would be a lot to list every manufacturer they use. They have 5 locations, and probably stock from a different manufacturer or multiple manufacturers at each one. reply",

          "text": "Ardour has really good default settings. Another, maybe forgotten one is Wavosaur on Windows [1]. Great modularity, one can quickly remove cruft that's not needed, or add a lot of data on waveforms when necessary. I admit being a fan of the Classic Windows era UIs, though. :) A third, also forgotten one from the Win2k/9x GUI era is maybe Waveshop [2], also a great example of keeping things simple. Funny thing: I used Reaper for years (occasional pro-level radio production), then had to switch to Pro Tools because of studio demands. Afterwards tried going with Reaper again, but got really overwhelmed with all those endless possibilities for customization. So... I ended up using Ardour, which was easiest to grasp from day one. Really well thought out and polished GUI. Possibly a great example of why it makes sense to have a subscription/payment based, non-free open source project. Oh, and Audacity up to version 1.26 was also great. After 2.x, it started to add bloat IMO. I remember Eric S. Raymond highlighted it as a great example of modular, unix-y design in \"The Art of Unix Programming\" [3]. 1: https://www.wavosaur.com/ 2: https://victimofleisure.github.io/WaveShop/ 3: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s01.html#aud... reply",

          "text": "DAWs and audio plugins are a good example. Digital audio workstations can be somewhat varied in UI, but plugins can be vastly different from each other even for two of the same tools. Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical controls is challenging. Fabfilter has been a popular developer for years. Oeksound and Denise Audio are great examples too. Newfangled Audio makes good stuff and their limiter elevate handles multiple pages well. They all pack parameters into tight, cohesive UIs that look good and remain intuitive. Fabfilter often uses submenus that can feel convoluted, but they're arguably necessary given their plugin's depth. Denise Audio takes a different approach with standard, simple UIs across their product line. Everything is visible with no submenus, though they may offer fewer controls overall. Deciding what controls to expose and how to organize them intuitively presents a unique challenge. Multiple pages like how Newfangled does it works well. I don't find Fabfilter's submenus to be the best but that's often because they are unlabeled and use small, unique icons that are hard to grok. The overall UI for primary features is usually quite good though. reply",

I think through common problems with 4o, tough problems with o3, I copy all of Svelte's docs into 4o ( https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ ) to get good Svelte 5-focused feedback, I have 4o code-review what Cursor writes from time to time, I have 4o, sometimes o3, generate \"precise\" prompts that I'll give to Cursor when me talking off-the-cuff to Cursor doesn't get good results after a few attempts. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet so I might be misusing Cursor, or not making enough use of its rules system, or something. I feel like I get good value for my ChatGPT subscription. I don't feel like I get good value for my Cursor subscription, but I also still feel like keeping it because $20 to type a lot less is still pretty nice. I would be upset if I only had a Cursor subscription and no access to ChatGPT. I am pretty hesitant to pay for AI à la carte.

My take is that most people did not invest the little time necessary to get acustomed to its workflow. My advices for aider are: - familiarize yourself with the chat modes (architect, code, ask) - familiarize yourself with the edit modes (diff, whole, etc) and know which to use for a given model. Indeed not all models handle all modes equally well. - make the code one feature at a time, by small chunks if needed, by limiting the contxt to the relevant files. - practice to learn how to best phrase stuff. - write you coding preferences into aider convention files. Things like \"always use type hints, beartype for type checking, python click for the cli, add many comments\". I'm mainly doing python and with proper comments and type hints it's really easy for models to write code that works with the rest of the repo even with only a few files in its context. reply",

That said, I don't get why people are fine switching their IDE to cursor. Lile, if you're in an IDE it's because it has features you want that others didn't. So either cursor does not have them or if it does then you have to configure the whole cursor IDE to work like your original IDE. In total you've either lost features or been captured into a new walled garden. And lost some time in the process. Aider's use of litellm makes it 5s change to switch to the latest models. And it's always up to date thanks to uvx. No really I don't get why people are not using aider more. Plus the dev is lovely, responsive and helpful. reply",

          "text": "I settled on gptel, which is an LLM package for Emacs. It's kind of a mix of both approaches: 1. You have chats right there in the editor, easy to copy/paste and manage context/history without switching to a browser. You can also quickly add files or portions of files to the context or remove them again. 2. You can choose which model you want to use for what, granted you have an API key. 3. You can quickly highlight some code and ask for a change to it, which along with managed context is powerful. I tried auto complete again and again but it doesn't work for me. At first I think \"yeah, that's what I wanted to write\", and then I have to look closer to realise it's not, and that completely breaks my flow and concentration. I can always write some pseudo code and proactively convert it to real code, I like to be in the driver seat. Context management is really central to my workflow, I manage it like a hawk. Models tend to deteriorate as context content increases, in my experience, so I really try to keep it narrow. For that reason, and because our clients didn't sign up for their code to be sent to Anthropic et al, I _mostly_ use models like I would use StackOverflow, not to generate non-trivial code I'd actually use. But having the chats in my editor is really invaluable for me. Powerful text wrangling features make a difference in both speed and motivation. I use it pretty heavily with pretty much only the high-end models and pay about $15 per month. reply",

The \"context-in-the-codebase\" thing for AI-based IDEsis overrated IMO. To extract the most from it, you have to remember to @mention the files. If you don't remember to @mention specific files, the agent simply tries to perform searches (i.e., it has access to that tool) on the files and folders until it gets some results... and will usually keep broadening the search until it does. It works well enough I suppose. But I still find myself beginning new chats (for example, per feature) because the model still loses its place, and with all the code/lint fixes it does, it starts to lose context. Then you're right back having to @mention more files to ensure the model knows how to structure your front end, back end, etc. (Please excuse any misnamed development terms.) :-) reply",

Probably better than chat, since it could touch all css, html and JS that are sprinkled around in different files. But that's not my main job. Overall, I think my work is mainly \"deep\" problem solving. I don't necessarily produce much code per day. The chat is a helpful aid for thinking, copilot not as much. Another thing I've noticed is that writing the code myself has often a net longterm benefit. For a while I was generating all kinds of python scripts for converting data between formats etc. I'm not good with python, but LLMs are, so I just used that. Until I ran into a wall too many times. Eventually every \"temporary script\" kept growing until LLMs could no longer provide what I wanted, and then I was stuck. I would have to go through the whole code from start and internalize it fully to be able to get the thing done. I would have saved time doing it myself from the start. So now I mainly use the chat just to ask about available functions, syntax, etc, but rarely use the generated code. IDEs are not great for this kind of approach in my experience. reply",

The API is crazy expensive and painfully slow. It’s best for one-shot queries where you ask one thing and expect nearly identical results every time. Anything beyond that and it struggles. With ChatGPT Canvas I’ve completed small projects like WordPress plugins, handy personal Python scripts, chrome extensions (my favorite use of ChatGPT) and most importantly debugged faster than any tool I’ve ever used. Sure, my customer-facing GPT API apps are burning credits like a rocket on full throttle but at least I’m billing them for it. The API speed is wildly inconsistent so you can’t rely on it for everything. One key tip is you can’t keep a single chat going forever. It gets sluggish, especially when you paste long code blocks. My method is simple. I ask for the final clean code, then request a complete detailed summary of what we built and what the functions do. Then I start a fresh chat, paste the summary and code, and continue clean. Think of it like making a commit, just a very crude version. reply",

Occasionally, the windsurf command overlays (explain, accept, etc...) will get stuck and make it impossible to see the code until I restart VS Code. But the biggest problem that I have is with automatic auto-complete. With both Windsurf and copilot, I have trouble figuring out when / if an autocompleted function or line of code will be accepted or generated. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to integrate my coding style with the tools, but I'm still trying because the work has been impressive thus far. I'm now also trying the same with with Claude-code, which has been pretty useful too. It managed to figure out and explain a fairly technical code base (a few DNA processing algorithms). I haven't tried with with code I'm unfamiliar with yet. So, my verdict so far: well worth the effort to try it and learn what's available. It's not that expensive to try. If it can help automate somethings (documentation and tests, for example), that's what I'm really hoping to use the AI assistants for. It works for actual coding too, but I still prefer to provide the main foundation. reply",

          "text": "To answer your question directly \"it depends\". There are a lot of different subtasks to coding. Defining requirements, sketching/discussing architecture, coming up with a technical plan, executing it, creating tests, etc. Different interfaces are better at different things. Cursor/Windsurf agentic flows can be great at well defined tasks that are directly actionable within the abstractions of the existing codebase. If you want to build new things, you need to be a little more methodical, and this can mean using chat interfaces to have a dialogue with AI. I use RepoPrompt [0] + Cursor Tab Complete (since it's easily the best on the market), but I don't use the in-IDE cursor/windsurf agentic flows unless I have a small task I need doing where I can describe it perfectly. RepoPrompt is an underhyped context selection tool that includes - A prompt formatter so you can easily dump it + prompts into chat windows - A built-in diff format prompt template that gets auto-inserted so you can auto-apply the resulting changes. - A unique \"Chat\" mode that's an API frontend for multi-turn conversations with dynamic code context, templated prompting, etc. - An incredible \"delegate edit\" feature where the results of your conversation get sent to cheaper/smaller LLMs to actually enact. The cost savings and increase in coherency are unreal. It's not unusual for a single turn to generate something like 50 specific edits across a dozen files that are completely coherent. Right now my main workflow is to discuss architecture with a context dump + prompt to o3, settle on a solution, build a PRD, give that to 2.5 Pro to create a more granular plan, make edits, then send it back to 2.5 Pro to delegate edits to Flash 2.0/DeepSeekV3/o4-mini. Not unusal to see it produce 20-50 edits across a dozen files with perfect coherency. Any fixups or minor things I do in cursor. There are also the CLI agentic code tools. I find claude code to be like a more powerful version of the cursor agent flow. They're great for directed tasks that involve a lot of exploration, like understanding how you need to integrate with some submodule on the other side of the codebase.

I've written it off as unusable for coding, but can be fine for educational purposes - For AI IDE coding, I narrow down the scope of what I ask so Gemini 2.0 Flash or Haiku can handle it. I've haven't seen better results switching to paid models. - For generating large swaths of code, I recently went back to copy/pasting into Claude Projects, with my github project hooked up and relevant files added to context. For a moderately complex component, it usually takes 5-15 generated versions to work, though I end up adjusting my specs a bit in the process. This is still faster than using the agent. Claude Code might get similar results, but I already pay for Anthropic so haven't tried it out. - If I'm picking up a new library, concept, or pattern, I usually chat with Claude to level up my knowledge. The \"Plan\" mode in cline focuses more on task execution than skill development. I'm open to suggestions on what to try next! reply",

          "text": "I've gone through a few AI IDEs / agents and CLI tools now, currently on Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro which is doing a pretty good job at my web app code with a decent .clinerules file in the repo. To answer why I don't use chat at all for coding anymore, some benefits of IDE / CLI agents: Copy pasting into chat apps don't allow for agentic runs (ie run bash commands, edit code, validate with linting / testing before marking task as 'complete'). I can mostly just write my descriptive task (usually with code references if they aren't already there in clinerules / claude.md, etc.) and come back after a short walk or drinking some tea and check the code or just check at runtime to ask it to fix up the code. This is honestly very similar to \"waiting for code to compile.\" For reference, I've used the following to make production code changes: - Cursor: which when Claude 3.5 was out seemed to be the best AI IDE, but the changes they've made around agent mode and 3.7 haven't really worked super well for me. Migrated to claude code after 3.7 came out. - Claude Code: Very good, I generally just ran it in dangerous mode and it could accomplish tasks fairly well. Wrote a decent Claude.md file as well. Only con is that it got expensive quickly. On the order of $3-5 per session which would accomplish a single task. - Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Moved to it yesterday, it's been doing a good job and is effectively free right now using my own API key for Gemini. Seems a bit verbose at times although that might just be Cline's prompts. I haven't tried Aider or Windsurf, but have heard good things about Windsurf's agentic mode. Although I might not move to Windsurf at all since Cline with Gemini works pretty well & is free to use. reply",

It indexes your code and has a good idea how it goes together and where your code is.

So they are able to do a lot of quality work locally before involving the major LLMs. A year's subscription falls at about $16/month. I would say Cursor is the first real use of AI and it gives so much unfair advantage to those who use it.

You use slash commands to add whatever you need to the context (single files, directories, highlighted selections, etc) and interact with a conventional chat interface from there. The prompt library also lets you store convenient system prompts if you have a diverse task domain. You can of course use their new agentic features which can automate a lot of the context management via tool use, but I find that to be a waste of time and resources for the majority of tasks I care about.

I had to prompt it several more times to give me generic code with better typings. I think it would be helpful for a total nooblet to get a hang of the basics but I think if they rely on the LLM too much beyond a certain point they will face diminishing returns. Think about it. There is so much knowledge in the world. Anyone can do anything to a satisfactory degree pretty quickly. But to really understand something takes experience and self-discovery.

          "text": "In my opinion, the most useful way to use LLMs for learning (anything, but including programming) is to have it explain things in terms of what you are familiar with. You can give the model context of things you know are relevant that you do understand (or at least have a functional understanding of), and ask it to explain things that you don't yet understand, building on what you know. For example, asking things like \"I am familiar with object encapsulation and mutating state over time in object oriented programming. If pure functional programming does not allow for mutation, how to you manage the state of objects over time?\" or \"Help me learn about Kubernetes. I am familiar with using docker, docker compose, and virtual machines for deploying my applications.\" The problem is when you're learning something completely foreign like learning to program in your first language, you don't really have enough context to ask meaningful questions. In that case, it is simply better to do things like read manuals and bang your head against the problem. reply",

          "text": "They can be useful, though you have to use them carefully. For instance, one of the best ways I've found to learn a new language or framework or technique is to find a working example of something, then take it apart piece by piece to see how it all fits together. LLMs can work really well here. They can give you a super basic example of how something works, as well as an explanation you can use as a jumping off point for further research. And those basic examples can be surprisingly hard to find elsewhere. A lot of open source systems are designed for people with no programming knowledge whatsoever, and in a way that they can handle 52 million possible use cases with all the caveats that brings along. So when you're trying to learn from them, you end up having to untangle hundreds of conditions and feature flags and config options and other things designed for use cases you simply don't have. LLMs can provide a simple, customised example that avoids that. That said, you have to be willing to try things yourself, and put in the effort needed to figure out why the code the LLM returned does what it does, and how it works on a technical level. If you're just throwing problems at the tool and letting them do all the work (like many vibe coders now), you're not really learning anything. reply",

          "text": "From my personal experiences, working with small engineering teams and running an comp sci education program[1]. TL;DR: There are some benefits, but mostly not worth it or actively harmful for students/junior engineers. 1) Students using LLMs to code or getting answers generally learn much slower than those who do it old fashioned way (we call it \"natty coding\"). A very important of the learning experience is the effort to grok the problem/concept in your own mind, and finding resources to support/challenge your own thinking. Certainly an answer from a chatbot can be one of those resources, but empirically students tend to just accept the \"quickest\" answer and move on (bad habbit from schooling). But eventually it hurts them down the road, since their \"fuzzy\" understanding compounds over time. It's similar to the old copy-from-StackOverflow phenomenon, but on steroids. If the students are using these new tools as the new search, then they still need to learn to read from primary sources (ie. the code or at least the docs). 2) I think one of the problems right now is that we're very used to measure learning via productivity. Ie. the ability of a student to produce a thing is a measurement of their learning. The new generation of LLM assistants breaks this model of assessment. And I think a lot of students feel the need to get on the bandwagon because they produce very immediate benefits (like doing better on homework) while incurring long-term costs. What we're trying to do is to actually teach them about learning and education first, so they at least understand the tradeoffs they are making using these new AI tools. 3) Where we've found better uses for these new tools are in situations where the student/engineer understand that it's an adversarial relationship. Ie. there's a 20% chance of bullshit. This positioning puts the accountability in the human operators (can't say the AI \"told me so\") and also helps them train their critical analysis skills. But it's not how most tools are positioned/designed from a product perspective. Overall, we've mostly prohibited junior staff/students from using AI coding tools, and they need a sort of \"permit\" to use it in specific situations. They all have to disclose if they're using AI assistants. There are less restrictions on senior/more experienced engineers, but most of them are using LLMs less due to the uncertainties and complexities introduced. The \"fuzzy understanding\" problem seems to affect senior folks to a lesser degree, but it's still there and compounds over time. Personally, I've seen myself be more mindful of the effects of automation from these experiences. So much so that I've turned off things like auto-correct, spellcheck, etc. And it seems like the passing of the torch from senior to junior folks is really strained. I'm not sure how it'll play out. A senior engineer who can properly architect things objectively have less use for junior folks, from a productivity perspective, because they can prompt LLMs to do the manual code generation. Meanwhile, junior folks all have high powered footgun which can slow down their learning. So one is pulling up the ladder behind them, while the other is shooting their feet.

          "text": "I think job stability/security for the individual is highly dependent on the company rather than the size.  Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have had a history of laying off employees during downturns, while Apple has generally been better about avoiding this (this most recent economic downturn has been the first time Apple has done large layoffs in quite a long time IIRC). Layoffs are always possible no matter the company, so it's good to be prepared financially for that, however, you can look at a company's history to determine how you should react when the economy starts going down. For example, I grew up during the 2008 financial crisis.  I frequently heard my friends' parents getting laid off from the big tech companies.  Years later as I've reflected on this, I came to the realization that if I ever get into a big tech company like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, that I either need to make it to a position where I'm confident I won't be axed, or get out before I do.  And even if I'm confident that I won't get the boot, I should still plan for the possibility of that happening. reply",

          "text": "I guess that OP is referring to teams having this builettin-board style posts as a default. You post a post and others can react and comment. Which works like a mashup of old school forum and chat. It breaks chronology as newest updates are not on bottom or top. It was even called teams. So teams had a special use section called... teams. They recently changed the logic. Chats and teams are in the same place, but the rest is still a thing. I don't think there is a way to notify a chat. Like on slack or zoom or whatever. You can make a webhook to teams (ekhm, the post board thing), but not a chat. So you basically can't use Teams to make many small notifications because you just can't show them next to each other - it's always a big post. My favorite \"feature\" of teams is the missclicks. If you use it folded, when chat list (or teams list...) autohides, some parts of the list takes to the chat you want, but some...click the element that was beneath whatever you clicked. So you wanted to change a chat to some 1:1 with a friend, but you clicked some OneNote in a group chat. reply",

Sometimes in the daytime the radio signals bounce off the ionosphere, the noise level goes way up and local chatting range is reduced because stations from 600 miles to thousands of miles away are coming in. In the days when it was popular trolling assholes would jam and disrupt. people up on a hill with an illegal high power amplifier talked over people. In the 1970s and 1980s high power AM transmissions sometimes blasted out of the neighbors cheaply-made hifi or scrambled their TV picture. https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/green-blackboa... The eleven meter wavelength means you need a reasonably large antenna for good performance. These days it is local CB is almost dead in most places and the noise level is often high in towns due to every house having a dozen switch mode power supplies and other electronics, which really reduces the range. Decades ago, when it was popular, it was chaotic. Some CB radios did not receive well if someone nearby was talking within a few channels of you. Meet ups at pubs sometimes turned into fist fights. These days, in most of Europe and the UK you may sometimes hear the last few old men and crazy nitwits that still use CB radio but they are often far away and a legal 4watt radio does not get out far enough for anyone to hear you. reply",

Because your expectations from pigeon mail more or less align with reality. And you expect from a 21st century software some basic things like cross device synchronization or at least reliable messsge and status drlivery, but it fails you, sonetimes  in most important moments of your life.

          "text": "When I was in college (over 20 years ago now), what we called “hackathons” was a bunch of us (4-6 max) holing up in an apartment for the weekend, and working on our personal projects while ordering pizza and sleeping on \n couches. It was really nice having a group of people you could demo what you were working on/ask for help or feedback within immediate range at all times. There was also something really peaceful about coding at 5a on Sunday while everyone else was fast asleep. When I moved to SF, I was so surprised to find out that there were “professional” hackathons. I went to a couple and came to the same conclusion as you. I do miss the vibe of the OG hackathons I did with my friends, but I was 19 and we had no commitments back then. Nowadays the best way for me to be productive is to have regular meal, disciplined working hours, and good nights of sleep - so no more sleeping on couches with half empty boxes of pizza by my side. reply",

          "text": "I hit 40 this year. I have definitely noticed a slowdown even in the last few years. Before 30 I could pull 2-3 all-nighters a week without really feeling any ill effects. Then, maybe early-to-mid 30's I could only handle one per week, assuming I'd slept well otherwise. The sleep debt would be too high still and the next day I'd get headaches, feel extremely tired and unmotivated. Or I could sustain 2-4hrs of sleep a night for like 3-4 days, but again I'd pay for it if I didn't catch up (pretty sure I'm paying for it long-term anyways). Here at the end of my 30's I can't really do a full 40-hours straight without sleep anymore (16hr day, 8hr night, 16hr day, then sleep). If I don't get at least 2hrs overnight then that second day is mostly wasted, maybe I get 4hrs out of the 16. I've always known that sufficient sleep is important for your health, and I've tried to balance times of all-nighters with crashes to catch-up, but the allure of using the night as uninterrupted focus time is so strong when you work in modern corporate \"open-plan\" environments where always-on Slack/Teams presence is expected during business hours. reply",

I think: - they've had this degree of fakeness for almost the entirety of their existence (as long as they've needed \"sponsorship\" / been 6+ figure events) - at its best, there also was a scene/subculture _surrounding_ hackathons that did care about building genuinely \"cool\" / \"impressive\" things, had an earnest interest in actually starting something longer term (there are some really successful founders that \"incubated\" in the hackathon scene). these folks frequented hackathons, and eventually moved on as the scene saturated with careerism / they \"grew up\" professionally reply",

Meatspace get-togethers focused on hacking, either for a specific project or for a clique, never used the term \"Hackathon\". At least in my circles. Those were just \"get togethers\" or maybe \"hacking weekends\". But with small caps. I.e., not \"Hacking Weekends\" or \"Hackathons\", but \"a weekend we're scheduling the purpose of which is to hack on something; i.e., a hacking weekend\". Less of an \"event for the public\" and more like \"a group of friends planning a weekend get-away\". I think for one of them we managed to get a few thousand or something from someone's employer to cover some costs. But \"sponsorship\" would be a strong word.

They’re primarily networking events and are still good for that. - Don’t bother checking the sponsors boxes too much. Have fun trying technical/product ideas that interest your for any _personal_ reason. Should fit with your team  project obviously. If not, keep it for next time and instead: - peer with others. Peering with a person you don’t know is an incredible social and technical experience, whatever your level difference. - sleep at night. You want to be rested to have a good and useful time. - don’t bother too much wining. The podium looks fancy but won’t make much a difference as soon as the doors close. It doesn’t really make a difference for networking, bootstrapping the resume line or having fun. But: - aim for a MVP or at least something that run and you can show. It’s not fun to tight the last knobs afterwards. Something (anything) functional will make you and your team proud, will assist the resume line and will be fun and memberberries for the future. reply",

If a company is a big sponsor and they're offering an extra prize for using their tool then people will figure out a way to jam it into their project, but it's rarely the optimal choice. I think it has always been like this. But if you really want to build something and there's a sponsor at the event you should ask them for lots of free credits or for some contact info in order to establish a longer-term sponsorship. reply",

Interns had plenty of motivation to make a splash (and to take chances) and working with them was often a breath of fresh air. On our larger team, we'd have week long hackathons where the theme was the elimination of jank/cruft/hazards/annoyances across code, infrastructure, and process. We'd split into 2-4 person teams and do our work, and at the end there'd be presentations and war stories, celebrations and the occasional defeat. Somebody would win a prize, and we'd do it again in 6 months. Corporate Hackathons have been a net positive for me, but I've also seen them implemented poorly, where you were still expected to shovel a full load of story points that sprint. reply",

There is precedence for this kind of action, which is why I’m skeptical of the legitimacy of the hackathons. There was a video contest and the top 3 were shown at a town hall. My team was one of the top 3. I had never seen the video and had no idea about this contest, nor had my boss (Sr Dir), nor had his boss (VP). As far as we could tell, some video production team was tapped to hack together a video in 30 minutes, they threw our name on it, and shipped it. I don’t trust much after that. reply",

          "text": "When I was salaried, I never participated in company-sponsored hackathons and actively resisted attending any conferences or anything of the sort. Even back in late 00's / early 2010's it all felt like sponsorship hell, and my point of reference for the activities was nigh-impossible to recreate.. When I was a teenager in the mid-90's, I would go to a monthly Boy Scouts Explorer Post group hosted/sponsored by CompuServe (at their headquarters). My brother and I were a couple years younger than some of the \"cool hacker\" dudes (it was almost all dudes), like this guy Travis who had already had multiple Dade Murphy-esque run-ins with the feds and would give little talks on why it's not worth it and was honestly really supported by the alpha-nerd adults (not pejorative) who worked for CompuServe who ran the thing and were trying to keep us all from life-changing mischief (while still encouraging safer mischief). Other attendees would give presentations on MODs (FastTracker / Impulse Tracker), or show off software they wrote (or found) that was cool, that kind of thing, and the only sponsor was CompuServe itself (which gave us all free dialup accounts). I remember one time we set up a booth at the fairgrounds, like inside of one of those giant, long open-air pavilion buildings that normally would have horse/animal stalls, with a row of computers to demo either their brand new service \"WOW!\" [0] or maybe it was WorldsAway [1] to the general public. I had no idea what I was doing lol, but it sure did feel important! Anyways, my rose-tinted vision of what a hackathon should be is some amalgamation of trading rainbow books at Cyberdelia mixed with those monthly CompuServe meetings where elders guided the young through the labyrinth of technology mixed with like a LAN party where instead of games, people get together, code, push boundaries, exchange ideas, and make something cool. Or something. Not a brutal, forced interaction with your coworkers that wastes time, produces jack shit, and is sponsored by SliceLine Pizza lol [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6BQzd2km58 [1] https://www.pcworld.com/article/424450/this-old-tech-remembe... reply",

Teams nowadays just `git clone` some repo, put in some crappy logo and then say \"I made this\", and they mean it.

No idea what are the social cues that led them to this, but I would find that interesting to study. I don't think they're ill intentioned, I think they don't consider lying to be bad and it's some sort of way of going through life. Not long ago I was having dinner w/ some scammers (one of them is on the latest YC batch, btw) and this guy was telling everybody that you need to lie to get ahead, \"if you don't lie to your investors they will invest in someone else who is lying to them\". This guy was somewhere between milennial and zoomer by age, but with a mien and mind more akin to that of a zoomer (TikTok, etc...). Very vulgar individual. That's SOTA these days. reply",

          "text": "I haven't been to a hackathon in a long time, but the best ones I remember were explicitly about getting designers and developers to build something concrete but simple for a good cause. I think in some cases just a working prototype was sufficient for the \"client,\" who could then more easily apply for grants to build  a more robust or fully featured version. POV, the PBS documentary series, used to have weekend hackathons in NYC in the early 2010s that paired the filmmakers with designers and coders. They were pretty good—filmmakers would come with an idea for a website they needed to support the film, basically, often a data visualization component or something to collect information from the public about the subject of the film. The Tribeca Film Institute did something similar a couple of times, too—I went to one at CERN that they ran where scientists worked with designers, developers, musicians, etc. to build projects presenting their research, and another in Detroit. I remember others like this as well from other organizations. It's still a bit of a weird format because you're basically doing pro bono or minimally paid freelance work on a tight deadline with your client sitting next to you, but they could produce some generally interesting work. Some hackathons in this category I remember also had a goal of letting non-coders understand how the coding process works, which is hard to balance with actually getting stuff done. reply",

Later, specific projects were started to help social service orgs implement some thing. Have to say, both events (and I attended several of each) were exciting. . . they challenged me in a way I was unfortunately not used to (except in high school and college) and showed that others were actually interested and part of the solution. The major plus of the budget hackathons was that we got to see students (middle schoolers, IIRC) who were doing whatever it was they were doing and having a blast.

At the end there was a big presentation that anyone in the company could attend and each team would present what they came up with. Some of them eventually became products directly, or at least set the groundwork for future products.

I got into hackathons in the early 2010s when IoT was the hot new thing and saw the crowds change from hardcore technologists to mostly students and idea people. The fact is the same thing that what drew me in is what attracted them - opportunity and optimism. Sponsors expect ROI and once a technology is no longer experimental, the same tired projects tend to win because they are tried and true. I've been to a couple of good hackathons lately but they are more focused on vibe coding and tend to only run for 8-12 hours. These let you try out an idea or framework with little commitment but lack the depth of multi-day events. I've been attending an XR hackathon for almost a decade which still embodies the ethos, but it is a labor of love carried out by volunteers. These longer, challenging and intentional events can teach you more about teamwork and product in one weekend than a year of churning through tickets. reply",

My guess is that this idea might hold in general, anything that can be built really quickly tends not to be too impressive and all impressive things tend to take longer.\nI have gotten to a point where, if I see something impressive, I have this nagging feeling, Was this completed here? or were you working on this for a decent amount of time and just took this opportunity to showcase it? reply",

          "text": "Seeing some good comments and will add to the pile. IMO it's not a \"now\" thing. There's a natural ad-hoc, close proximity vibe that some gatherings have. They often come with everything else, including flow and good (best of this kind) memories. I imagine some of these were called hackathons and some LAN parties, etc. Nevertheless it's not a straightforward thing to recreate artificially. Unfortunately most public / large \"hackathons\" I went to were failed attempts. I've had the great experience of growing up in eastern Europe in 90s and 00s and so in highschool if you qualified for the higher stages of CS olympiads you were allowed to skip classes and spend time in the \"lab\" with the other \"olympics\". That was the first \"hackathon\", basically sometimes a few weeks in a row of coding with everyone else from 8AM till whenever you were in trouble if you didn't get home. Sometimes playing Doom, sometimes with the teachers, but most times coding. It was ... \"electric\" - unfortunately I don't have writing skills to make justice to it. \nThen there were the LAN parties and those were very good too, and so on. I've actually been through a few hackathons at work that were pretty good. Every time they are with the people you know well and few more (1-2) degrees of separation, but always with a shared goal and nothing else but the pure shared goal of the hackatahon. Everyone is already fluent and will hit the ground running, etc. Otherwise it's bunch of people that never worked together, not \"style\" cohhesion, etc. fucking around trying to figure out stuff that should already be in place for a proper hackathon. I could go on and think I'd probably have a few good things to add here, but wouldn't be sure that it's a \"solution\", just some facts from my own experience. But man, those days in the \"lab\" doing CS problems, they gave me the \"high\" for what coding can be like for the rest of my life. I don't need more than 15s of that to want to GO, haha :) reply",

The hackathons I remember as a college student were different. They were much more free form. You were asked to create something around a broad topic: eg graphics, operating systems, modeling a neuron. You were allowed and encouraged to go outside the box. Getting the prize was fun, but a working artifact was much more satisfying. That’s why we did it. So, yes, it’s too commercial these days. reply",

          "text": "I run a nonprofit called Hack Club that helps organize most of the hackathons for high schoolers in the USA. We’ve been trying to make high school hackathons much more around building fun projects you’re proud of than building something “impressive” - and it’s working! You may like this video of Hack Club Scrapyard, our hackathon where you had to build stupid projects. We had 3,000 high schoolers come to the 61 locations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8iM1W8kXrQA What makes Hack Club events different is: 1) You must actually ship a project with a live, deployed URL and open source code, or it doesn’t count 2) They are peer-judged, instead of judged by clueless “experts” who can’t tell if a project is fake or not 3) They are organized by high schoolers, for high schoolers so there is a heavy emphasize on friendship-building and helping people go on adventures One cool project from Scrapyard was “Desktop Circus”, where your home screen gets invaded by a circus cast that messes with your mouse, moves windows on your screen, etc. It’s inspired by Desktop Goose, which was built by another Hack Clubber. https://bucketfish.itch.io/desktop-circus It’s funny, when you have those 3 constraints suddenly everything feels less like “college application” and much more about building cool stuff to show your friends. All the ChatGPT wrappers rank poorly. It’s really important that we as a society encourage young people to have fun with technology. reply",

If the client was literally completely passive and had no other role in their task than hiring the firm for something that wasn't part of a larger effort thet were actively engaged in, then, sure, they would have nothing relevant to the task to sacrifice by being the agent coordinator, they'd just need to spend the time learning to be an agent coordinator, and then actually become an active full-time participant rather than completely passive -- but presumably they were passive because that's exactly the level of engagement they were willing to put in, or, at least, because they found that being more active in the task had some associated disutility. reply",

Imagine you are a trader and asked agents to build you a perfect trading system and they discuss every next buy/sell and take a call to execute the action. How do you know in the long term you are making money? What if they decided to cheat on you and started buying stocks which will definitely crash in 1 month, while showing you a progress of profit by day trading other stocks. Would you just let them do what they're doing? reply",

But I didn’t sell features. I asked what their clients hated most, then built a fix for that. One well-placed feature, and the doors swung open. Real users, real feedback—and we’re still building on that foundation. Then there’s my blog. A creative sandbox, no overlap with my day job. No built-in audience. No distribution. Still waiting on subscriber #1 (Mom, seriously—now would be a good time). Takeaways: Partner with someone who already has meaningful reach.\n\n    Solve a real, hair-on-fire problem.\n\n    Offer something free to earn early trust.\n\n    Knock on doors, pitch relentlessly, repeat. And hope the gods of luck are listening. As for the writing side—different beast. Slower burn, no roadmap, no shortcuts. Still wandering in the woods, but enjoying the walk.

One Zoom meeting later, we had the foundation of a partnership. Honestly, it could’ve been any event. Just show up, be sincere, and listen more than you pitch.

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud.

          "text": "Not ignorant at all. I'm not sure if they’ve added any monetization features over the years. Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

          "text": "Might be fortunate instead: they're setting up to be able to train AI on specifically you and then, if needed, make music AS you undercutting you. Such is the way of things these days. I dropped Soundcloud paid version too, and migrated to just YouTube. Currently YouTube is trying very hard to learn to reply to my fans AS me, but through pushing buttons to immediately supply AI-generated responses. I'm sure anyone else with a substantial YouTube presence has seen this too. So far, they are not self-pressing the button and taking over replying to my fans for me, against my will. So far. They'd also be looking at some challenges in AIing my content as it's weekly open source software development serving a specialized audience, though they would have a considerably easier time AIing my thumbnails, as those are a very predictable pattern and reproducible. Regarding OP, and in the light of what I've said, maybe ask yourself in what way you can disambiguate yourself from any random AI-powered startup in targeting what for the other startup will be an arbitrary or shotgun selection of customer targets. Is there an audience you can work specifically for, and is there a way you can signal to that audience that you're particularly aware of them and interested in working for them? reply",

          "text": "Of course. Most of the AI cases (that turn out to be an actual success) focus around a few repeatable patterns and a limited use of \"AI\". Here are a few interesting ones: (1) Data extraction. E.g. extracting specs of electronic components from data-sheets (it was applied to address a USA market with 300M per year size). Or parsing back Purchase Order specs from PDFs in fragmented and under-digitized EU construction market. Just a modern VLM and a couple of prompts under the hood. (2) French company saved up to 10k EUR per month on translators for their niche content (they do a lot of organic content, translating it to 5 major languages). Switched from human translators to LLM-driven translation process (like DeepL but understanding the nuances of their business thanks to the domain vocabulary they through in the context). Just one prompt under the hood. (3) Lead Generation for the manufacturing equipment - scanning a stream of newly registered companies in EU and automatically identifying companies that would actually be interested in hearing more about specific types of equipment. Just a pipeline with ~3-4 prompts and a web search under the hood. (4) Finding compliance gaps in the internal documents for the EU fintech (DORA/Safeguarding/Outsourcing etc). This one is a bit tricky, but still boils down to careful document parsing with subsequent graph traversal and reasoning. NB: There also are tons of chatbots, customer support automation or generic enterprise RAG systems. But I don't work much with such kinds of projects, since they have higher risks and lower RoI. reply",

People that were genuinely interested to learn more about the topic - opened my profile and followed the links there. This and interesting content was enough to grow community organically to 14k subscribers over 2 years. Another approach to speed up the growth - organise some fun event that benefits the entire community, highlights and showcases the participants. E.g. when I organised last Enterprise RAG challenge, we got 350 submissions from the teams around the world. Plus IBM joined as a sponsor. People were mostly participating not for the prises, but because of the approachable challenge and ability to push state of the art. Plus some were hired away because of the good leaderboard scores. Article of the winner (just google \"Ilya Rice: How I Won the Enterprise RAG Challenge\") is considered by some companies as one of the best resources on building document-based AI systems. And the entire community sees it as the result of their work together - further reinforcing the spirit of the collaboration. People tend to share and spread fruits of their labor and love. reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

Obviously, our product is very different from yours, but one thing that worked well for us was focusing on building momentum within small communities first rather than trying to appeal to everyone immediately. Tight-knit groups tend to generate stronger early engagement, which can give you the traction (and feedback) you need to grow. Another thing we learned: making it dead simple for users to share made a big difference. Even small friction points kill word-of-mouth, so optimizing for effortless sharing really amplified our reach. In your case remove as much friction as possible whatever that is. reply",

          "text": "I use Cursor as my base editor + Cline as my main agentic tool.  I have not tried Windsurf so alas I can't comment here but the Cursor + Cline combo works brilliantly for me: * Cursor's Cmk-K edit-inline feature (with Claude 3.7 as my base model there) works brilliantly for \"I just need this one line/method fixed/improved\" * Cursor's tab-complete (neé SuperMaven) is great and better than any other I've used. * Cline w/ Gemini 2.5 is absolutely the best I've tried when it comes to full agentic workflow.  I throw a paragraph of idea at it and it comes up with a totally workable and working plan & implementation Fundamentally, and this may be my issue to get over and not actually real, I like that Cline is a bring-your-own-API-key system and an open source project, because their incentives are to generate the best prompt, max out the context, and get the best results (because everyone working on it wants it to work well).  Cursor's incentive is to get you the best results....within their budget (of $.05 per request for the max models and within your monthly spend/usage allotment for the others).  That means they're going to try to trim context or drop things or do other clever/fancy cost saving techniques for Cursor, Inc. .  That's at odds with  getting the best results, even if it only provides minor friction. reply",

Follow up with Codex. `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking` Machtiani will stream the answer, then also apply git patches suggested in the convo automatically. Then I could follow up with codex. `codex \"See unstaged git changes. Run tests to make sure it works and fix and problems with the changes if necessary.\" 2. Codex and MCT together `codex \"$(mct 'fix bad response on h2 server' --model deepseek/deepseek-r1 --mode answer-only)\"` In this case codex will dutifully implement the suggested changes of codex, saving tokens and time. The key for the second example is `--mode answer-only`. Without this flagged argument, mct will itself try and apply patches. But in this case codex will do it as mct withholds the patches with the aforementioned flagged arg. 3. Refer codex to the chat. Say you did this `mct \"fix bad response on h2 server\" --model gpt-4o-mini --mode chat` Here, I used `--mode chat`, which tells mct to stream the answer and save the chat convo, but not to apply git changes (differrent than --mode answer-only). You'll see mct will printout that something like `Response saved to .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md` Now you can just tell codex. `codex \"See .machtiani/chat/fix_bad_server_resonse.md, and do this or that....\"` *Conclusion* The example concepts should cover day-to-day use cases. There are other exciting workflows, but I should really post a video on that. You could do anything with unix philosophy! reply",

But I daily drive Cursor because the main LLM feature I use is tab-complete, and here Cursor blows the competition out of the water. It understands what I want to do next about 95% of the time when I'm in the middle of something, including comprehensive multi-line/multi-file changes.

If everything was equal, that might possibly be true, but it turns out that system prompts are quite powerful in influencing how an LLM behaves. ChatGPT with a blank user entered system prompt behaves differently (read: poorer at coding) than one with a tuned system prompt. Aider/Copilot/Windsurf/etc all have custom system prompts that make them more powerful rather than less, compared to using a raw web browser, and also don't involve the overhead of copy pasting. reply",

I have yet to switch back to try out cursor again but starting to get frustrated with Windsurf being restricted to gathering context only 100-200 lines at a time. So many of the bugs and poor results that it can introduce are simply due to improper context. When forcibly giving it the necessary context you can clearly see it’s not a model problem but it’s a problem with the approach of gathering disparate 100 line snippets at a time. Also, it struggles with files over 800ish lines which is extremely annoying We need some smart deepseek-like innovation in context gathering since the hardware and cost of tokens is the real bottleneck here. reply",

That's the opposite of the style of work you get with Cursor or Windsurf. Is it less efficient? If you are paid by LoCs, sure.

So far, I’ve only tried it on vibe coding game development, where every model I’ve tested struggles. It says “I rewrote X to be more robust and fixed the bug you mentioned,” yet the bug still remains. I suspect it will work better for backend web development I do for work: write a failing unit test, then ask the agent to implement the feature and make the test pass.

Zed would sometimes return the file content in the chatbox instead of updating it. Zed Agent also inserted a new function in the middle of the existing function. \n- Better at running tests/compiling. Zed struggled with nix environment and I don't remember it going to the update code -> run code -> update code feedback loop. With this you can leave Claude Code alone for a few minutes, check back and give additional instructions. With Zed Agent it was more of a constantly monitoring / copy pasting and manually verifying everything. *I haven't tested many of the other tools mentioned here, this is mostly my experience with Zed and copy/pasting code to AI.

If you can do things at 2x the speed, you can charge 1.5x and clients will be very happy. And if things are done faster, you can layer on more quality things as well – tests, features, fancy backgrounds and animations, optimizations for low end devices, and so on. People are often afraid that being too productive will make them run out of work. But with software, here's an endless amount of things to do. One of the more valuable things a contractor can do is help a profitable company with tech debt transition out of the tech debt. Eventually they become productive and take on tech debt because there's value to releasing new products as early as possible, and it's an endless cycle. reply",

But here’s something I’ve noticed:\nPeople who can calmly use AI to solve real, small, human problems — those people are still rare. You already have solid engineering experience. If you combine that with one thing you like solving — like automating reports, or filtering client messages — that’s a strong start. You don’t have to be flashy. You just have to be trustworthy.

All I can find after a bunch of keyword + date-restricted searches in Google, Quora, & HN is Ibrahim Bashir ( https://www.quora.com/Who-designed-UI-UX-and-developed-the-w... ) who worked there 2003-2005 ( https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-work-for-McMaster-Carr... ) and who writes: > McMaster-Carr has a Systems department which handles internal software development, including the website. I actually worked on a lot of the front-end functionality (among other things) during my tenure there and we had 1 person who was essentially the UX lead (I'm sure the team / function has expanded since then).\n>\n> The design philosophy for the website was heavily influence by Edward Tufte and myself and several folks from my engineering team were enrolled in his course to familiarize ourselves with key concepts.\n>\n> When I interviewed with McMaster-Carr I distinctly remember a Director who told me about building the first version of the website himself and not realizing it would become \"a real thing\" one day. I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he was a sharp guy and I'm sure he's off doing great things. We walked into work one Monday morning, and his desk was empty and his whiteboard said \"poof\". Given the timing and his description of what he did, it seems unlikely any other McMaster-Carr insider would have been writing about it, and this has to be what you are remembering, if anything. (And https://iacollaborative.com/work/mcmaster-carr/ seems useless here.) reply",

          "text": "This… is brilliant. Google and Facebook are highly lucrative because they designed a system where your profit margins (as a business) are largely sucked up by Google and Facebook by making you bid against your competitors at higher and higher values until someone is willing to give up almost all of their margins to be the top bidder for the favored “top spot”. Hypothetically, if you make $1 in profit on your product, theory says that some competitor will bid up to $0.99 to secure that sale and if you don’t bid this amount also, your sales will suffer. The end result is that Google and Facebook end up consuming all the profits for a large number of businesses online that have to survive by advertising, which explains Google’s immense profit margins. Assuming what you say is true, this is truly a ballsy move by McMaster. Betting that their website is unassailable by their competition and thus such a value-add that they can forgo playing the losing game that Google and Facebook has setup is brilliant. I have such respect for that. reply",

The filter/apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster's auto updating window. Usually, when I'm looking for something, it's not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right. The other thing McMaster does that's kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn't make sense.

They are a supplier, and might want to obfuscate to keep you from buying direct from the actual manufacturers. On the other hand, on my desk right now is a bag of springs, the info printed on it says it was made by WB Jones, part number 4011. We ordered it from McMaster. Why not? They stock the item and ship super quick. If I want another bag of the same springs, it's not like I can go to McMaster, type in \"springs 4011\" and expect to find it. Instead, I'll have to search up purchasing requests I've made, maybe ask a coworker if they ordered them, etc. to find the mcmaster number again. If I didn't know Mcmaster sold it to us, I'd have no idea they sold it at all. To be fair, if they sell things that are interchangeable, like screws, it would be a lot to list every manufacturer they use. They have 5 locations, and probably stock from a different manufacturer or multiple manufacturers at each one. reply",

Browsers can enable very rich and responsive interfaces, but web development is bogged down by the insane state of popular frontend stacks.

          "text": "Ardour has really good default settings. Another, maybe forgotten one is Wavosaur on Windows [1]. Great modularity, one can quickly remove cruft that's not needed, or add a lot of data on waveforms when necessary. I admit being a fan of the Classic Windows era UIs, though. :) A third, also forgotten one from the Win2k/9x GUI era is maybe Waveshop [2], also a great example of keeping things simple. Funny thing: I used Reaper for years (occasional pro-level radio production), then had to switch to Pro Tools because of studio demands. Afterwards tried going with Reaper again, but got really overwhelmed with all those endless possibilities for customization. So... I ended up using Ardour, which was easiest to grasp from day one. Really well thought out and polished GUI. Possibly a great example of why it makes sense to have a subscription/payment based, non-free open source project. Oh, and Audacity up to version 1.26 was also great. After 2.x, it started to add bloat IMO. I remember Eric S. Raymond highlighted it as a great example of modular, unix-y design in \"The Art of Unix Programming\" [3]. 1: https://www.wavosaur.com/ 2: https://victimofleisure.github.io/WaveShop/ 3: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s01.html#aud... reply",

          "text": "DAWs and audio plugins are a good example. Digital audio workstations can be somewhat varied in UI, but plugins can be vastly different from each other even for two of the same tools. Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical controls is challenging. Fabfilter has been a popular developer for years. Oeksound and Denise Audio are great examples too. Newfangled Audio makes good stuff and their limiter elevate handles multiple pages well. They all pack parameters into tight, cohesive UIs that look good and remain intuitive. Fabfilter often uses submenus that can feel convoluted, but they're arguably necessary given their plugin's depth. Denise Audio takes a different approach with standard, simple UIs across their product line. Everything is visible with no submenus, though they may offer fewer controls overall. Deciding what controls to expose and how to organize them intuitively presents a unique challenge. Multiple pages like how Newfangled does it works well. I don't find Fabfilter's submenus to be the best but that's often because they are unlabeled and use small, unique icons that are hard to grok. The overall UI for primary features is usually quite good though. reply",

The good news is that there are a bunch of other jobs still left. And for a long time yet there are still lots of IT jobs that are safe. To be fair, low-skill programming jobs have been replaced for years. Lots of them outsourced offshore. (Does it matter if your job goes to AI or a Bengali?). But today's systems are huge, and complex, and require a lot more than what AI can do (impressive as that is.)

It's somewhat like a jerk genie and I feel like I'm writing a contract rather than working with an assistant. Claude 3.5 doesn't have this problem. Gemini 2.5 Pro will one shot complex instructions and even read between the lines. The drawback is that it can often overthink as well. One example was I want to deselect a dropdown if I recreate it (e.g. select state when changing countries). The ideal solution is to just check this on the view layer. Gemini 2.5 pro is terrible at this - it'll go down into lower layers and overengineer, when the solution should just to set as null if the new dropdown doesn't contain the same text. GPT 4.1 has been quite good lately, but it's not quite as agentic and it will ask you a lot of questions and request confirmation to begin. It is perfect for workflows where you aren't certain yourself. GPT is also smartest from the visual angle, able to read color variations well and designs them well. Claude is the worst visually. reply",

This might be too pricey, so you could then go for a Surfans F20 like already recommended ( https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/AIGOErosQK ). It has no balanced output, but is about 120 bucks and supports Rockbox. If you more into Android and streaming, you could take a look at the Hiby M300 which is also a budget device, but has a pretty modern Android and is a bit more portable than a smartphone. Maybe it's also worth mentioning Qobuz ( https://www.qobuz.com/ ), the high res music streaming service. Many audiophiles are into this, while I'm not using streaming services at all. I personally use an old iPod Nano 7g and as backup device my Android phone with Substreamer / DSub and self hosted navidrome. Not hi-res, I don't need this :-) reply",

Cursor seems kind of \"dumb\" compared to 4o, but it's a good workhorse. I let Cursor handle the basics - basically acting as a glorified multi-file autocomplete. I think through common problems with 4o, tough problems with o3, I copy all of Svelte's docs into 4o ( https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ ) to get good Svelte 5-focused feedback, I have 4o code-review what Cursor writes from time to time, I have 4o, sometimes o3, generate \"precise\" prompts that I'll give to Cursor when me talking off-the-cuff to Cursor doesn't get good results after a few attempts. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet so I might be misusing Cursor, or not making enough use of its rules system, or something. I feel like I get good value for my ChatGPT subscription. I don't feel like I get good value for my Cursor subscription, but I also still feel like keeping it because $20 to type a lot less is still pretty nice. I would be upset if I only had a Cursor subscription and no access to ChatGPT. I am pretty hesitant to pay for AI à la carte. I feel much better about working within the limitations of a known subscription cost. reply",

          "text": "I'm SO surprised to not see aider-chat everywhere mentionned. I've been using it for about a year and it's incredible. My take is that most people did not invest the little time necessary to get acustomed to its workflow. My advices for aider are: - familiarize yourself with the chat modes (architect, code, ask) - familiarize yourself with the edit modes (diff, whole, etc) and know which to use for a given model. Indeed not all models handle all modes equally well. - make the code one feature at a time, by small chunks if needed, by limiting the contxt to the relevant files. - practice to learn how to best phrase stuff. - write you coding preferences into aider convention files. Things like \"always use type hints, beartype for type checking, python click for the cli, add many comments\". I'm mainly doing python and with proper comments and type hints it's really easy for models to write code that works with the rest of the repo even with only a few files in its context. reply",

So either cursor does not have them or if it does then you have to configure the whole cursor IDE to work like your original IDE. In total you've either lost features or been captured into a new walled garden. And lost some time in the process. Aider's use of litellm makes it 5s change to switch to the latest models.

          "text": "I settled on gptel, which is an LLM package for Emacs. It's kind of a mix of both approaches: 1. You have chats right there in the editor, easy to copy/paste and manage context/history without switching to a browser. You can also quickly add files or portions of files to the context or remove them again. 2. You can choose which model you want to use for what, granted you have an API key. 3. You can quickly highlight some code and ask for a change to it, which along with managed context is powerful. I tried auto complete again and again but it doesn't work for me. At first I think \"yeah, that's what I wanted to write\", and then I have to look closer to realise it's not, and that completely breaks my flow and concentration. I can always write some pseudo code and proactively convert it to real code, I like to be in the driver seat. Context management is really central to my workflow, I manage it like a hawk. Models tend to deteriorate as context content increases, in my experience, so I really try to keep it narrow. For that reason, and because our clients didn't sign up for their code to be sent to Anthropic et al, I _mostly_ use models like I would use StackOverflow, not to generate non-trivial code I'd actually use. But having the chats in my editor is really invaluable for me. Powerful text wrangling features make a difference in both speed and motivation. I use it pretty heavily with pretty much only the high-end models and pay about $15 per month. reply",

The \"context-in-the-codebase\" thing for AI-based IDEsis overrated IMO. To extract the most from it, you have to remember to @mention the files. If you don't remember to @mention specific files, the agent simply tries to perform searches (i.e., it has access to that tool) on the files and folders until it gets some results... and will usually keep broadening the search until it does. It works well enough I suppose. But I still find myself beginning new chats (for example, per feature) because the model still loses its place, and with all the code/lint fixes it does, it starts to lose context. Then you're right back having to @mention more files to ensure the model knows how to structure your front end, back end, etc. (Please excuse any misnamed development terms.) :-) reply",

Probably better than chat, since it could touch all css, html and JS that are sprinkled around in different files. But that's not my main job. Overall, I think my work is mainly \"deep\" problem solving. I don't necessarily produce much code per day. The chat is a helpful aid for thinking, copilot not as much. Another thing I've noticed is that writing the code myself has often a net longterm benefit. For a while I was generating all kinds of python scripts for converting data between formats etc. I'm not good with python, but LLMs are, so I just used that. Until I ran into a wall too many times. Eventually every \"temporary script\" kept growing until LLMs could no longer provide what I wanted, and then I was stuck. I would have to go through the whole code from start and internalize it fully to be able to get the thing done. I would have saved time doing it myself from the start. So now I mainly use the chat just to ask about available functions, syntax, etc, but rarely use the generated code. IDEs are not great for this kind of approach in my experience. reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple apps just for myself using the API and honestly it sucked. The chat remembers context and talks to you like a real conversation. The API is crazy expensive and painfully slow. It’s best for one-shot queries where you ask one thing and expect nearly identical results every time. Anything beyond that and it struggles. With ChatGPT Canvas I’ve completed small projects like WordPress plugins, handy personal Python scripts, chrome extensions (my favorite use of ChatGPT) and most importantly debugged faster than any tool I’ve ever used. Sure, my customer-facing GPT API apps are burning credits like a rocket on full throttle but at least I’m billing them for it. The API speed is wildly inconsistent so you can’t rely on it for everything. One key tip is you can’t keep a single chat going forever. It gets sluggish, especially when you paste long code blocks. My method is simple. I ask for the final clean code, then request a complete detailed summary of what we built and what the functions do. Then I start a fresh chat, paste the summary and code, and continue clean. Think of it like making a commit, just a very crude version. reply",

Occasionally, the windsurf command overlays (explain, accept, etc...) will get stuck and make it impossible to see the code until I restart VS Code. But the biggest problem that I have is with automatic auto-complete. With both Windsurf and copilot, I have trouble figuring out when / if an autocompleted function or line of code will be accepted or generated. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to integrate my coding style with the tools, but I'm still trying because the work has been impressive thus far. I'm now also trying the same with with Claude-code, which has been pretty useful too. It managed to figure out and explain a fairly technical code base (a few DNA processing algorithms). I haven't tried with with code I'm unfamiliar with yet. So, my verdict so far: well worth the effort to try it and learn what's available. It's not that expensive to try. If it can help automate somethings (documentation and tests, for example), that's what I'm really hoping to use the AI assistants for. It works for actual coding too, but I still prefer to provide the main foundation. reply",

          "text": "To answer your question directly \"it depends\". There are a lot of different subtasks to coding. Defining requirements, sketching/discussing architecture, coming up with a technical plan, executing it, creating tests, etc. Different interfaces are better at different things. Cursor/Windsurf agentic flows can be great at well defined tasks that are directly actionable within the abstractions of the existing codebase. If you want to build new things, you need to be a little more methodical, and this can mean using chat interfaces to have a dialogue with AI. I use RepoPrompt [0] + Cursor Tab Complete (since it's easily the best on the market), but I don't use the in-IDE cursor/windsurf agentic flows unless I have a small task I need doing where I can describe it perfectly. RepoPrompt is an underhyped context selection tool that includes - A prompt formatter so you can easily dump it + prompts into chat windows - A built-in diff format prompt template that gets auto-inserted so you can auto-apply the resulting changes. - A unique \"Chat\" mode that's an API frontend for multi-turn conversations with dynamic code context, templated prompting, etc. - An incredible \"delegate edit\" feature where the results of your conversation get sent to cheaper/smaller LLMs to actually enact. The cost savings and increase in coherency are unreal. It's not unusual for a single turn to generate something like 50 specific edits across a dozen files that are completely coherent. Right now my main workflow is to discuss architecture with a context dump + prompt to o3, settle on a solution, build a PRD, give that to 2.5 Pro to create a more granular plan, make edits, then send it back to 2.5 Pro to delegate edits to Flash 2.0/DeepSeekV3/o4-mini. Not unusal to see it produce 20-50 edits across a dozen files with perfect coherency. Any fixups or minor things I do in cursor. There are also the CLI agentic code tools. I find claude code to be like a more powerful version of the cursor agent flow. They're great for directed tasks that involve a lot of exploration, like understanding how you need to integrate with some submodule on the other side of the codebase.

I've haven't seen better results switching to paid models. - For generating large swaths of code, I recently went back to copy/pasting into Claude Projects, with my github project hooked up and relevant files added to context. For a moderately complex component, it usually takes 5-15 generated versions to work, though I end up adjusting my specs a bit in the process. This is still faster than using the agent. Claude Code might get similar results, but I already pay for Anthropic so haven't tried it out. - If I'm picking up a new library, concept, or pattern, I usually chat with Claude to level up my knowledge.

To answer why I don't use chat at all for coding anymore, some benefits of IDE / CLI agents: Copy pasting into chat apps don't allow for agentic runs (ie run bash commands, edit code, validate with linting / testing before marking task as 'complete'). I can mostly just write my descriptive task (usually with code references if they aren't already there in clinerules / claude.md, etc.) and come back after a short walk or drinking some tea and check the code or just check at runtime to ask it to fix up the code. This is honestly very similar to \"waiting for code to compile.\" For reference, I've used the following to make production code changes: - Cursor: which when Claude 3.5 was out seemed to be the best AI IDE, but the changes they've made around agent mode and 3.7 haven't really worked super well for me. Migrated to claude code after 3.7 came out. - Claude Code: Very good, I generally just ran it in dangerous mode and it could accomplish tasks fairly well. Wrote a decent Claude.md file as well. Only con is that it got expensive quickly. On the order of $3-5 per session which would accomplish a single task. - Cline with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Moved to it yesterday, it's been doing a good job and is effectively free right now using my own API key for Gemini. Seems a bit verbose at times although that might just be Cline's prompts. I haven't tried Aider or Windsurf, but have heard good things about Windsurf's agentic mode. Although I might not move to Windsurf at all since Cline with Gemini works pretty well & is free to use. reply",

You get quality + speed/stability + low price, there's just little reason to paste anything into websites anymore, and no reason to go back to Copilot. reply",

          "text": "Zed strikes a good balance I think with their non-agentic text threads feature. You use slash commands to add whatever you need to the context (single files, directories, highlighted selections, etc) and interact with a conventional chat interface from there. The prompt library also lets you store convenient system prompts if you have a diverse task domain. You can of course use their new agentic features which can automate a lot of the context management via tool use, but I find that to be a waste of time and resources for the majority of tasks I care about. I currently manage my own fork to use a custom FIM completion provider I built, that tends to do most of the heavy lifting for me in terms of anything AI-generated. reply",

I forget almost everything I know about building software and instead focus on memorizing tricks and optimizations and processes for solving leetcode algorithm questions.

That's what companies want now, so that's what I have to deliver - I don't have a fucking choice. I look over system designs, try to understand what the core aspect is. For the most part I tend to pass those without as much of a problem. Nothing works best, but doing this has gotten me further than actually practicing and writing code. I have 8 YoE, took a career break on short term disability for burnout/early childhood horrors that I needed to deal with. Its 2 years later, I'm able to code again and am picking up things much faster than ever, but I'm about to lose my apartment and move into a friends basement because a career break is, apparently, career suicide right now, and even contract companies won't even interview me because of the career break. I was getting cold recruited by FAANG before. I just want the opportunity to work so I can have stable housing, and I'm doing everything I can. It gets harder and harder to practice. I consider whether my career was a sham all along often. I don't really care that this is venting, there's nobody to talk to about it. reply",

And for a lot of us, it's not just about prep - it's dealing with burnout, gaps, and the mental load that comes with the whole process. A few of you mentioned mock interviews and practicing tricky questions. That's actually something I've been working on, a tool called HirePrep ( https://hireprep.app ) that generates interview questions based on your resume + the job you're applying for. It's meant to make prep feel less generic and more like the real thing. Anyway, thanks again to everyone who contributed. This thread's been weirdly comforting. reply",

          "text": "Always. Every interview exists to narrow down the applicant pool. Unless it's an automated interview, I would rather stay unemployed than take one of those. The prep depends on the interview type. Most fall into 3 categories. 1. Algorithms - I remember a better time in life when I had the luxury to wait until I had an interview scheduled and only then would I have the motivation to grind. I'm now grinding everyday since it takes time to make meaningful improvements. Although a part of me enjoys these type of questions, it does make me question my career choice. I guess the one silver lining is that I'm getting much better at solving these questions than when I was employed. 2. System design - For this type of interview I've found that it's all about your ability to guess what type of system they'll want you to build and what parts they'll be interested in focusing on. 3. Behavioural - This actually requires the most company specific preparation. Refining your behavioural stories to match what the company is looking for and with who you're interviewing with (i.e Recruiter or C-suite level). Thinking of meaningful questions to ask. Practicing mock interviews. It all takes time. reply",

          "text": "I have a list of technical questions I tend to stumble over. Things like SSL pinning, cache management, CI/CD, github stuff, and DI. Often things that colleagues have set up 3 years ago and are now just a function call on Slack. Every interview will ask the same questions: \"Tell me something about yourself. Why would you leave such an awesome job? Are you willing to take a pay cut for equity? Why do we need you instead of paying a junior and giving them AI? How do you practice Agile in your workplace? How would you train a junior? How much are you being paid now? How do you feel about trans people and dogs?\" Some of these are traps. The only wrong answer is sounding defensive or evasive. So it's important to practice taking these head on. I find that if you nail the first interview with the decision maker(s), you will get the job. You can fail the interview but they'll even give you another one because they see it as some kind of error. If you excel at the technical interview and don't pass the vibe check, they'll find a reason to reject you. Then they'll pick at the number of past jobs you held (too many or too few), resume gaps, 'culture fit', etc. And if they absolutely find nothing to reject you for, you'll get rejected for being overqualified. Also it's important to interview for the role you're applying for, not the one you hold. For me, it's a shift – founding engineer/staff+/TL/EM/CTO at this point. The IC roles aren't being evaluated from an IC angle. They're being evaluated from an angle of whether I can lead product next year once the company has raised $100m. They don't know anything about you. They don't know that I used to spend my teenage years as a kind of PM making games with strangers over the internet. The unwritten question I have to answer by the end of the interviews is, \"Can this engineering degree nerd from a developing Muslim majority country lead a team of white people who went to MIT?\" reply",

Or some variation of traveling salesman. Optimization skill matters no matter where you work, but mostly in the sense that you're not applying O(2^n) unnecessarily. Multiple interviews are really based on funnel size, and funnel size is based around expectations and whether the company can afford full-time recruiters. If you're paying say, $1500/month for a junior here like Accenture does, the funnel will be full and you can drag people through multiple rounds. Many will just prefer to pay $800 and grab the first applicant that passes. reply",

I don't think this is good general advice, especially for positions where you're still primarily hands on code, but has worked quite well for me. It's also very helpful to not be applying via public HR processes. Warm intros to specific teams / leadership makes everything so much easier.

          "text": "I think job stability/security for the individual is highly dependent on the company rather than the size.  Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have had a history of laying off employees during downturns, while Apple has generally been better about avoiding this (this most recent economic downturn has been the first time Apple has done large layoffs in quite a long time IIRC). Layoffs are always possible no matter the company, so it's good to be prepared financially for that, however, you can look at a company's history to determine how you should react when the economy starts going down. For example, I grew up during the 2008 financial crisis.  I frequently heard my friends' parents getting laid off from the big tech companies.  Years later as I've reflected on this, I came to the realization that if I ever get into a big tech company like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, that I either need to make it to a position where I'm confident I won't be axed, or get out before I do.  And even if I'm confident that I won't get the boot, I should still plan for the possibility of that happening. reply",
