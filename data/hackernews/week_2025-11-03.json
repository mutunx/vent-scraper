WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. We’re looking for senior software engineers to build our data platform and help us ingest and model messy, unstructured data into insights and actionable intelligence. At the heart of this is a 50m+ entity knowledge-graph with 200m+ relationships represented - and we need your help to build a system that can scale this up by an order of a magnitude. Today, we mostly use Python, Postgres, Airflow and Pyspark. If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you. Apply here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/wirescreen/89e08ab3-01ed-4296-9459-...

I've programmed in many languages and environments over the years. Some of my current interests are: • Aviation and geographic data. For example, airspace and obstacle data importers for Wing; election results and voter information maps for Google; many interactive maps for other companies. • Hardware interfacing. In a way, I am a \"full stack\" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest. • Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build. • Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code. I want to make sure it's the right code for what my users need, and that it's easy to maintain and improve as we learn more about what they want. Open to full time or contract. I look forward to talking with you! reply",

The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what.

While I do replace things all the time, I typically use multiple cursors (I do use bindings for that).

As far as keeping up with whats latest and greatest, I think the real answer is there isn't a good online resource. There are emacs meetups and conferences and some are virtual, and you can ask around other power users and see what they are doing. I even find emacs packages to be pretty poor at selling themselves on why you should use them.

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there. So I would not recommend those to new users, at least not if you would like to learn the basics and get a better hang of it, to be able to debug it, though some seem to be happy with those. reply",

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

Neither of the above is things I do more often than a handful of times a year. Meanwhile, terminal Emacs plays well with tmux and SSH which I do a lot of. For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box. I can steal this tmux session from any new connection. It also survives if the machine I'm sshing from dies or reboots. I can't think of a way to make it work with GUI emacs. reply",

Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess.

There's also validity to Emacs pre-dating GUIs, the IBM keyboard, and the x86 instruction set. Once you get past the history of windows and killing, you can explore. The history is also super interesting! https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?EmacsHistory https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386324 After you've read the tutorial, go wild. Try stuff out. Break things. Fix them. Learn your limits. Learn that there are very few limits imposed by Emacs itself. Hands down, the best resource for Emacs is Emacs itself. Especially, the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual. The \"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp\" is also excellent if you're not familiar with Lisp. Learn to read Info files and learn the help system (basically C-h f and C-h v) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ Emacs really is a flagship of Freedom, with all its pain and glory. It lets you exist at the threshold of your zone of proximal development. Every bit you put into Emacs, you get a return on investment. Welcome to the Emacs community! It's full of weirdos and wizards, as well as regular folk. Stick around and I'm sure you'll make friends in no time. reply",

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

          "text": "> gpt-oss-120b is amazing Yup, I agree, easily best local model you can run today on local hardware, especially when reasoning_effort is set to \"high\", but \"medium\" does very well too. I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

Same with the Mac mini, get the studio instead, it has a fan, the Mini does not. I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline. I do think Macs are phenomenal at running local LLMs if you get the right one. reply",

          "text": "Qwen3:32b on MBP M1 Pro 32GB running Asahi linux.  Mainly command line for some help with armv8 assembly, and some SoC stuff (this week explaining I2C protocol).  I couldnt find any good intro on the web-of-ads.  It's not much help with Zig, but then nothing seems to keep up with Zig at the moment. I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats? [edit] be sure to use it powered, linux is a bit battery heavy, but Qwen3 will pull 60W+ and flatten a battery real fast. reply",

After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users.

All the software is implemented by myself, but I started out with basically calling out to llama.cpp, as it was the simplest and fastest option that let me integrate it into my own software without requiring a GUI.

Desktop, Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB of RAM, RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM), performs very well and I can run most of the models I use daily all together, unless I want really large context then just GPT-OSS-120B + max context, ends up taking ~70GB of VRAM. > What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short). Almost anything and everything, but mostly coding. But then general questions, researching topics, troubleshooting issues with my local infrastructure, troubleshooting things happening in my other hobbies and a bunch of other stuff. As long as you give the local LLM access to a search tool (I use YaCy + my own adapter), local models works better for me than the hosted models, mainly because of the speed and I have better control over the inference. It does fall short on really complicated stuff. Right now I'm trying to do CUDA programming, creating a fused MoE kernel for inference in Rust, and it's a bit tricky as there are a lot of moving parts and I don't understand the subject 100%, and when you get to that point, it's a bit hit or miss. You really need to have a proper understanding of what you use the LLM for, otherwise it breaks down quickly. Divide and conquer as always helps a lot. reply",

On both i have setup lemonade-server on system start.\nAt work i use Qwen3 Coder 30B-3A with continue.dev. It serves me well in 90% of cases. At home i have 128GB RAM. I try a bit GPT120B. I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes. But i would like to allow parallel requests, so i need to tinker a bit more. Maybe llama-swap is enough. I just need to see how to deal with context length. My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM). Btw. even a AMD HX 370 with non soldered RAM can get some nice t/s for smaller models. \nCan be helpful enough when disconnected from internet and you dont know how to style a svg :) Thanks for opening up this topic!

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

That was not an FP invention, though. Delphi already did it - they kept the Apple's Object Pascal constructs from Turbo Pascal, and then bolted a whole new object system in parallel. FP inherited that mess and has to maintain it for backwards compatibility reasons. That said, given that the two systems are completely orthogonal, you can simply ignore the older one. The biggest thing going in favor of FP is that it has been around for almost 30 years now, so it's very mature. reply",

It had design decisions to evolve it more like newer languages (eg it has inbuilt async/await and did on .Net before C#, tuples, nullables etc) and sanitised the syntax somewhat. I like it a lot. https://www.remobjects.com/elements/oxygene/language reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me.

Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker.

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.). Curious as the advice rings sound, but I only saw your consultancy work. reply",

Three outcomes in order of likelihood: - they take the hint and leave - they improve enough to get the PIP off them - you have justification for disciplinary actions including termination.

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

I would if you are value to company and he is really being an outright asshole on this meeting be prepared to say \"look if you're not gonna genuinely cooperate as your lead I'll officially file a complaint/recommend to boot you from this team/whatever\" and leave.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

As far as I can tell, your only real course of action is to learn to live with him. I've worked with many people like this. Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.” - Marcus Aurelius, \"Meditations\" reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

But given you're in the leadership seat, it's worth taking a hard look\nat yourself asking how you're playing a role in this, especially since it's unlikely people are this difficult for no reason. I am rather a bit skeptical of this account as written. One hint: he was told he was meant to be the lead. That's a bit of a shitty promise to be given and taken away. This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem.

          "text": "I think there are four pieces of evidence: - One person on the team does not respect him. That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

Being correct and being willing to verbalize when you don’t know something or don’t know the ideal answer to a situation is the number one trick to establishing a reputation as a rockstar IMO. That may give you a lot of sway. Keep a great paper trail both on this guy and to cover your own ass. I would probably begin building a case to fire him, aka “managing him out”. I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits? As long as you document the shit out of everything he does wrong, your ass is covered. Best of luck, I can’t stand obnoxious people at work so I hope you can get him his comeuppance. reply",

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure.

In response to your final paragraph especially, it sounds like you need to have a real, frank conversation with someone who can help you navigate this situation. One in which you can get into the complex details of the situation and balance all your competing needs and desires. I say this because, sadly, you will not be able to solve this problem by running away from it, because it will find you again and you'll be even more tired and even less interested in dealing with it. You probably need more than \"Get out and take your people with you\". If you'd like to try to have this conversation, then I think I can help. You can start with my handle here, search the web, find out more about me (to judge for yourself whether I might be able to help you or I'm full of shit), and then contact me. If you think we might click, then ask me for help. Ignore anything that you see along the way that looks like a price. Meantime, any advice I can offer will sound like a platitude, so I won't bother. The reality of the situation is much more complex than that. Instead, think about what you'd like to have happen and maybe we can figure out how to make it happen. Peace. reply",

Or just use N8N :) I feel like there are a lot of tools in this space, but they're all flawed, or they all defeat the purpose of Clay - which is having easy access to a lot of integrations with external data providers, and then falling back to their AI agent if you can't find a data provider. You're probably not going to save money by spending more time stitching together multiple tools, instead of doing everything at once in Clay. That said, I did compiled some alternatives in my blog awhile ago if you're interested. (Just search for \"Bloomberry Clay alternatives\"). If you're OK with some limitations like less CRM integrations (ie. some only support Hubspot), or less data providers (some use less contact data providers in their waterfall enrichment), then there definitely are some cheaper ones you can try. Is there a particular thing you can live without? reply",

I'm not aware of anything with the JSONBin.io API (frankly I don't like their API, I think it should be more RESTful). CouchDB is in many ways very similar to JSONBin and self hostable. I have also written small services that use SQLite's JSON support and wrap that up in a fairly restful API (e.g. POST a document to a list adds an item, etc.). Another option is to use something like PostgREST, which I get isn't at all what you asked, but in this day and age you can just ask ChatGPT to make you a schema and it takes 2 minutes to prototype a REST API. Really it depends if you have preferences for what datastore you use, as that is the more difficult bit when self hosting. reply",

It's so overwhelmingly dominant that it eclipses almost every other platform put together, with some exceptions for consoles and mobile. Even when it's targeted at these, Steam is such a powerful marketing/discovery channel for games. When Steam says no AI, nobody does AI. It's not just no AI generated content, some argue it means no brainstorming dialogue via AI and so on. The game dev community selects for this. This means that alternative platforms like Itch tend to also lean towards anti-AI even if they could differentiate by allowing AI. Consoles tend to also build for PC and adopting AI would cost them too much. Pro-AI people tend to move to other platforms like Play Store and App Store, and lately we're seeing more quality control ramp up on these. reply",

Did Chrome change? Seems overall the same to me. Did Firefox change, might depend on whom you ask.

If your problem is die early, then it loses information an assert() would preserve. If your problem is a dislike of if-elif-elif- then I think you argue more for a case: statement than a GOTO.

One methodology I've seen used with installed apps is major upgrades require a financial renewal but those can be spaced out every couple years. I love it when I find an iOS app that is paid, without ads, without in-app purchases. You just need to plan how that business model works and know that you won't have recurring revenue. Maybe that means you build companion apps, offer an optional subscription tier (often its cloud storage/device sharing based) or something like that. I've thought of doing a subscription like service but its use case is more of a once-in-a-while style so an option there would be pay-per use instead of a subscription. reply",

However the business is as it is For software I really like the patreon model (like in some game communities) monthly subscription you could cancel after downloading and if you want updates you just get another month. Big portion will just pay monthly while they wait anyway. Best for all worlds. Otherwise I would maybe recommend a yearly price instead of monthly. Especially if the monthly would be something small anyway. Easy to forget so most people will at least pay 2 years and you save a lot in transaction costs. reply",

          "text": "On the contrary. Subscription-based pricing model is dying, and fast. People are tired of it. Just look up articles about how SaaS are slowly disappearing and how entrepreneurs should avoid creating SaaS if possible. People usually prefer one-time payments over monthly payments. There are exceptions, usually when the program/service is very valuable and expensive, it makes more sense to just pay for what you use, but in general single payment will always win. Also it depends whether we're talking local or remote service as remote service has inherent cost and having a single payment is not compatible with it. Additionally, there is a distinction between single and ongoing payment in the context of usability. Specifically, it makes little sense to sell a calculator program via a subscription fee but you also reach a limit of the possible customer base. Just like mobile applications. With subscription, you can keep milking the same customer for money indefinitely, but in such case you have to keep providing some services that is worth the payment. reply",

          "text": "In the beginning we sold a product for a one-time fee. Every couple of years we'd release a (paid for) upgrade. The market was young, new features were obvious. The company was funded by \"new sales\". Development, support, admin etc was all funded by sales. As our customers grew, so our costs grew. Support goes up, so fine, we'll offer support contracts. But users typically don't sign up for these (but call support anyway and get pissed if we blow them off, or bill them.) We make \"updates\" and sell those. But to do that we must \"add features\" (customers expect all bug fixes to be free forever). Adding features which offer true value becomes harder. Upgrade sales drop off, but now we have lots of different versions in the field. Obviously sales plateaus at some point. The list of people receiving value goes up, the potential market gets smaller. In short, the source of revenue and the receivers of value are disconnected. This is not sustainable. You are one or two bad sales months from closing up shop. The optimal strategy for this business model is to find the sales peak, terminate all support, and accumulate as much from residual sales as possible. We switched to a subscription model. Now those receiving value (updates, fixes, support, training, features etc) pay a known amount at a known time. We can budget, they can budget. If sales disappear current development and support can continue. (Aka Covid). Income and expenses are aligned. We sell to business not consumers. While consumers might not like subscriptions, businesses love them. They allow for much simpler procurement (no sudden support or upgrade bills), assurance of longevity, reduced capital costs upfront. We can grow headcount based on known income. We can grow sustainably without requiring sales to match. Subscriptions work because the match income to expenses. Those who receive value pay for it in a sustainable way. It's as simple as that. reply",

          "text": "Is it a “bug” when Apple releases a new OS/phone that either breaks backwards compatibility or does something like release the iPhone 5 and changes the form factor making your app look janky?  This was when Apple released frameworks to allow phones of different sizes around 2012? Or more recently should users expect a free upgrade when Apple deprecated 32 bit apps? The Mac sees a lot less churn than iOS.  But things do happen that cause apps not to work there.  The most recent is that Electron was using a private API and all apps that used that version of Electron on Macs broke. reply",

All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

We’re looking for two roles, from mid-senior to senior engineer with at least 5+ years of experience. Backend:  Strong in backend development, ideally Java, but open to those willing to learn. DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role. Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn. Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform. Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas. To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”. Please send any git/bitbucket/source-forge project that represents your coding otherwise I’ll ask you to complete a small test project. reply",

          "text": "Phrasing.app | Co-founder | EUROPE REMOTE Phrasing is a bootstrapped company dedicated to building the most effective and efficient way to learn a language. I’m a polyglot myself and have always struggled for a few main reasons: 1. Apps only ever focus on taking you from 0-1, never from 1-100. 2. If you have any experience in the language, it’s really hard to pick it up after a few years. 3. Language learning apps are always ugly, clunky, ugly, and just stressful to use. And ugly. 4. No apps support maintaining and learning multiple languages simultaneously 5. Apps only ever support the major languages, leaving minority languages in the dust So, I set off to build my dream language learning application, and a quick 2 years and 10,000 hours later I’d built Phrasing. It’s launched, it’s live, it has (happy) paying daily users, and I myself am using it to learn 18 languages. The product is ready to go, and the business is already growing organically. I’m looking for someone cracked to come in in a co-founding capacity and eventually take over the backend (elixir) codebase from me. No experience is required so long as you’re passionate, talented, and hungry. If you’re interested, and located in Europe, send me an email at hn@phrasing.app. reply",

Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society. We are building the best-in-market speech-to-text and NLP solutions for Dutch healthcare professionals and are looking for an experienced Senior Mobile Engineer to lead the development of Attendi’s native mobile application. You will play a central role in bringing our voice-powered technology directly into the daily workflows of caregivers — designing, building, and maintaining high-performance native Android and iOS applications that make documentation effortless and personal. You’ll work closely with our backend and frontend engineers, designers, and product team to deliver a seamless, intuitive experience. This is a greenfield project where you’ll have end-to-end ownership: from architecture and UX considerations to release and continuous improvement. Your work will help bring Attendi’s vision of hands-free, human-centered healthcare to life. We have a dedicated team with fewer than 30 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity.

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a entry or mid-level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail.

You built something powerful. Early adopters get it. But broader adoption stalls because the experience doesn't create its own momentum. I specialize in that exact inflection point - making sophisticated tools feel like discovery rather than homework. My approach comes from 10 years running an indie game studio. I apply behavioral psychology to B2B/developer tools. Not gamification - actual intrinsic motivation that makes the 100th use rewarding. Judge for IGF, MagFest, CODiE, GEE, Serious Games awards.

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line! reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

I'm a data scientist in a world of data technicians and I look for hard problems to solve. Hair on fire \"This is causing lemon-law recalls and we can't solve it.\" type problems - I've done a few of those. I have 15+ years experience helping companies plan, prototype, and productionize sane data science solutions. I love avant-garde problems, and have a pretty unique skillset. I've worked with names you know in automotive, aviation, tech, and other spaces. Recently I've been working with Oil & Gas - Production estimates, pricing, failure analysis, and other interesting things. I've worked on projects including LLMs, knowledge extraction, automotive part failure prediction, vehicle route planning in constrained environments, translation, maintenance optimization, automated sports highlights, maritime piracy, and more. Two things I would love to work on, feel free to ping me on these: - Offensive & defensive security. I've been working through some ideas for a while now  to apply AI (Not LLMs) to security. I think they could harden a network environment even in the presence of usable exploits against an active adversary. \n \n    - Executive memory and longer range functioning using LLM's.

          "text": "I'm not really commenting on that, I'm saying the practice is good for me as an interviewee. However I do think it's a good way to filter candidates. I should clarify that what I'm talking about is fairly basic programming tasks, not very hard leet code style DSA type tasks. I've never been given an actually hard task in an interview, they've all been fairly simple tasks like write a bracket tax calculator, write a class that stores car objects and can get them by plate number and stuff like that. Helped a friend do a take-home one where we fetched some data from spacex's api and displayed it in a html table. Every time I do these, people act like I'm Jesus for solving a relatively simple task. Meanwhile I'm just shocked that this is something my peers struggle with. I would have honestly expected any decent dev to be able to do these with roughly the same proficiency as myself, but it turns out almost nobody can. That's why I think it's a good way to test candidates. If you're going to work as a programmer you should be able to solve these types of tasks. I don't care if you're frontend, backend, finance, healthcare, data science, whatever kind of programming you normally do, you should be able to do these kinds of things. If someone can't then by my judgement they don't really know programming. They may have figured out some way to get things done anyway but I bet the quality of their work reflects their lack of understanding. I've seen a lot of code written by this kind of people, it's very clear that a lot of developers really don't understand the code they're writing. It's honestly shocking how bad most \"professional software developers\" are at writing simple code. reply",

          "text": "Reply intended to user zwnow who is banned by HN, so I cannot reply directly. You confuse intent with reality. The social software under discussion was abused immediately for the criminal purpose of spreading falsehoods about men, both with malicious intent and wilful negligence, which is particularly egregious because the victims were not made aware of the slander. Even if they wanted to defend themselves, they were prevented from doing so because of the institutionalised sexism, men are banned from participating on grounds of their sex alone. The proof for this is in the leaks. You failed to take this into account and hence got downvoted into oblivion, not for the reason you claim. The other facts you write about are part of a different narrative, they are not directly relevant to kanwisher's proposition. IMO, we should not have any tolerance for platforms that are designed for gossip because of the boy-cries-wolf effect in backlash because it means if a woman is a genuine victim, people will take the priors into account and most will assume she's a liar, too, and this lets the perpetrators off the hook. I do not want to live in such a society. The way out of this is holding women accountable, they should be punished for criminal behaviour with immediate and drastic consequences, and tenfold so for their enablers. The problem would stop overnight. reply",

They could even be described as “selfish” in the sense that the “contributor” is haphazardly making whatever change minimally fixes their exact use case without consideration for the project’s style, health, usability, or other users. This isn’t outright malicious or even deliberately inconsiderate, but it still has a negative effect. Refusing such a PR (which, again, is most of them) is easy. But it is also time consuming if you don’t want to be rude. Everything you point out as inadequate is a chance for them to rebut or “fix” in a way which is again unsatisfactory, which only leads to more frustration and wasted time. The solution is to be specific about the project’s goals but vague about the code. Explain why you feel the change doesn‘t align with what you want for the project, but don’t critique specific lines. There are, of course, exceptions. Even when I refuse a PR, if it’s clear it was from a novice with good intentions and making an effort to learn, I’ll still explain the issues at length so they can improve. If it’s someone who obviously used an LLM, didn’t understand anything about what they did and called it a day, I’ll still be polite in my rejection but I’ll also block them.

Some of your ideas have come up in that venue, please go make issues there to discuss your ideas my 2 cents on AI output: these tools are very useful, please wield them in such a way that it respects the time of the human who will be reading your output. This is the longest PR description I have ever read and it does not sound like a human wrote it, nor does it sound like a PR description. The PR also does multiple unrelated things in a single 1k line changeset, which is a nonstarter without prior discussion. I don't doubt your intention is pure, ty for wanting to contribute.

A fun, on-going issue at work is trying to coordinate with a QA team who believe chatgpt can write css selectors for HTML elements that are not yet written. That same QA team deeply care about the spirit of their work, and are motivated by, the _very_ relatable sentiment of, you DONT FUCKING BREAK USER SPACE. Yeah, in the unbridled, chaotic, raging plasma that is our zeitgeist at the moment, I'm lucky enough to have people dedicating a significant portion of their life to trying to do quality assurance in the idiomatic, industry best-standard way. Blame the FUD, not my team. I would put to you that the observation that they do not (yet) grok what, for lack of a more specific universally understood term we are calling, \"AI\" (or LLMs if you are Fancy. But of course none of these labels are quite right). People need time to observe, and learn. And people are busy with /* gestures around vaguely at everything /*. So yes, we should acknowledge that long-winded trash PRs from AI are a new emergent problem, and yes, if we study the specific problem more closely we will almost certainly find ever more optimal approaches. Writing off the issue as \"stupidity\" is mean. In both senses. reply",

Much more so than before, I'll comfortably reject a PR that is hard to follow, for any reason, including size. IMHO, the biggest change that LLMs have brought to the table is that clean code and refactoring are no longer expensive, and should no longer be bargained for, neglected or given the lip service that they have received throughout most of my career. Test suites and documentation, too. (Given the nature of working with LLMs, I also suspect that clean, idiomatic code is more important than ever, since LLMs have presumably been trained on that, but this is just a personal superstition, that is probably increasingly false, but also feels harmless) The only time I think it is appropriate to land a large amount of code at once is if it is a single act of entirely brain dead refactoring, doing nothing new, such as renaming a single variable across an entire codebase, or moving/breaking/consolidating a single module or file. And there better be  tests. Otherwise, get an LLM to break things up and make things easier for me to understand, for crying out loud: there are precious few reasons left not to make reviewing PRs as easy as possible. So, I posit that the emotional reaction from certain audiences is still the largest, most exhausting difference. reply",

However after 25 years I was still shooting myself in the foot on the regular. I evaluate Go, Rust and fpc. I'm too dumb for Rust, Go's was close but lack of exceptions and classes made it not for me. Fpc hit the sweet spot. The syntax is a little clunky but I have classes when I need them, exception handling, memory management - both auto and manual and cross platform support. Plus I can fit in my head - unlike C++</div>",

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

That was not an FP invention, though. Delphi already did it - they kept the Apple's Object Pascal constructs from Turbo Pascal, and then bolted a whole new object system in parallel. FP inherited that mess and has to maintain it for backwards compatibility reasons. That said, given that the two systems are completely orthogonal, you can simply ignore the older one. The biggest thing going in favor of FP is that it has been around for almost 30 years now, so it's very mature. reply",

At the same time, even modern Pascal dialects seem niche and the communities and libraries aren't quite there, especially when it comes to the ease of doing something like webdev: mORMot exists but will never be as popular and deeply integrated with everything like something like Spring Boot https://github.com/synopse/mORMot2 That said, there are also some cool projects out there, for example, a whole game engine: https://castle-engine.io/ I'm especially mentioning that, because the dev actually did a nice writeup on Pascal: https://castle-engine.io/modern_pascal There's also a list of some software using Pascal: https://wiki.freepascal.org/Projects_using_Free_Pascal and sometimes it's packages that you might not immediately think of, like PeaZip which is a nice little program: https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip I will also say that the idea of having a community Wiki for the programming language and the projects around it seems really nice: https://wiki.freepascal.org/ Maybe not possible for super widespread languages, but for someone taking a look around this is really, really nice. reply",

With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what.

While I do replace things all the time, I typically use multiple cursors (I do use bindings for that).

As far as keeping up with whats latest and greatest, I think the real answer is there isn't a good online resource. There are emacs meetups and conferences and some are virtual, and you can ask around other power users and see what they are doing. I even find emacs packages to be pretty poor at selling themselves on why you should use them. As an example, Ivy and Counsel are kind of game changers to the UI, but I don't think you get any idea of that from their manual or main github page: https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper reply",

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there. So I would not recommend those to new users, at least not if you would like to learn the basics and get a better hang of it, to be able to debug it, though some seem to be happy with those. reply",

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

There's also Protesilaos' Stavrou channel on YouTube with a good amount of videos covering Emacs' topics in depth. I highly recommend them.

Neither of the above is things I do more often than a handful of times a year. Meanwhile, terminal Emacs plays well with tmux and SSH which I do a lot of. For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box. I can steal this tmux session from any new connection. It also survives if the machine I'm sshing from dies or reboots. I can't think of a way to make it work with GUI emacs. reply",

Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess.

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

Specifically:<p>Which model(s) are you running (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, or others) and which open-source coding assistant/integration (for example, a VS Code plugin) you’re using?<p>What laptop hardware do you have (CPU, GPU/NPU, memory, whether discrete GPU or integrated, OS) and how it performs for your workflow?<p>What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short).<p>I'm conducting my own investigation, which I will be happy to share as well when over.<p>Thanks!\nAndrea.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

And while the LLM is doing the prompt processing I write my instructions of what I want to have done. Usually the LLM is long finished with PP before I am finished with writing instructions.

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline. I do think Macs are phenomenal at running local LLMs if you get the right one. reply",

I couldnt find any good intro on the web-of-ads.  It's not much help with Zig, but then nothing seems to keep up with Zig at the moment. I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats? [edit] be sure to use it powered, linux is a bit battery heavy, but Qwen3 will pull 60W+ and flatten a battery real fast. reply",

After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users.

You are probably downloading one of these two ids: `granite4:small-h` or `granite4:32b-a9b-h`. The \"small\" model _is_ small in relative terms, but is also the largest of the currently released granite models!

All the software is implemented by myself, but I started out with basically calling out to llama.cpp, as it was the simplest and fastest option that let me integrate it into my own software without requiring a GUI. I use Codex and Claude Code from time to time to do some mindless work too, Codex hooked up to my local GPT-OSS-120b while Claude Code uses Sonnet. > What laptop hardware do you have (CPU, GPU/NPU, memory, whether discrete GPU or integrated, OS) and how it performs for your workflow? Desktop, Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB of RAM, RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM), performs very well and I can run most of the models I use daily all together, unless I want really large context then just GPT-OSS-120B + max context, ends up taking ~70GB of VRAM. > What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short). Almost anything and everything, but mostly coding. But then general questions, researching topics, troubleshooting issues with my local infrastructure, troubleshooting things happening in my other hobbies and a bunch of other stuff. As long as you give the local LLM access to a search tool (I use YaCy + my own adapter), local models works better for me than the hosted models, mainly because of the speed and I have better control over the inference. It does fall short on really complicated stuff. Right now I'm trying to do CUDA programming, creating a fused MoE kernel for inference in Rust, and it's a bit tricky as there are a lot of moving parts and I don't understand the subject 100%, and when you get to that point, it's a bit hit or miss. You really need to have a proper understanding of what you use the LLM for, otherwise it breaks down quickly. Divide and conquer as always helps a lot. reply",

I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes.

My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM).

I stay in the driver seat; the model becomes the copilot. Human-in-the-loop and such. Worked really well for my website development, other personal projects and even professionally (my work laptop has its own Open WebUI account for separation). reply",

          "text": "Because for most major sites, updating the status page requires (a significant number of) humans in the loop. Back when I worked at a major cloud provider (which admittedly was >5 years ago), our alarms would go off after ~3-15 minutes of degraded functionality (depending on the sensitivity settings of that specific alarm). At that point the on call gets paged in to investigate and validates that the issue is real (and not trivially correctable). There was also automatic escalation if the on call doesn't acknowledge the issue after 15 minutes. If so, a manager gets paged in to coordinate the response, and if the manager considers the outage to be serious (or to affect a key customer), a director or above gets paged in. The director/VP has the ultimate say about posting an outage, but they in parallel consult the PR/comms team to consult on the wording/severity of the notification, any partnership managers for key affected clients, and legal re any contractual requirements the outage may be breaching... So in a best-case scenario you'd have 3 minutes (for a fast alarm to raise) plus ~5 minutes for the on call to engage, plus ~10 minutes of initial investigation, plus ~20 minutes of escalations and discussions... all before anyone with permission to edit the status page can go ahead and do so reply",

It's a flawed tactic to try and hide/dismiss any downtime (people will notice), but it's in our human nature to try and hide the bad things? [1] ie https://ohdear.app/features/status-pages reply",

          "text": "Status pages usually start as a human-updated thing because it's easy to implement. Some time later, you might add an automated check thing that makes some synthetic requests to the service and validates what's returned. And maybe you wire that directly to the status page so issues can be shown as soon as possible. Then, false alarms happen. Maybe someone forgot to rotate the credentials for the test account and it got locked out. Maybe the testing system has a bug. Maybe a change is pushed to the service that changes the output such that the test thinks the result is invalid. Maybe a localized infrastructure problem is preventing the testing system from reaching the service. There's a lot of ways for false alarms to appear, some intermittent and some persistent. So then you spread out. You add more testing systems in diverse locations. You require some N of M tests to fail, and if that threshold is reached the status page gets updated automatically. That protects you from a few categories of false alarms, but not all of them. You could go further to continue whacking away at the false alarm sources, but as you go you run into the same problem of service reliability, where each additional \"9\" costs much more than the one that came before. You reach a point where you realize the cost of making your automatic status page updates fully automatically accurate becomes prohibitive. So you go back to having a human assess the alarm and authorize a status page update if it is legitimate. reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

(After attempting to address the issue. But my experience is that toxics are gonna toxic. Don’t coddle them.) If you’re willing to lightly scorch some bridges, talk to your skip-level manager. If that doesn’t work, or you don’t want to, your best option is to go work for a decent manager, either at the same company or another one. Life’s too short, and you’re not going to be able to fix the toxic employee. In other words, get someone who can help, or get out. Take your friends with you. reply",

He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued.

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour.

He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

(Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

          "text": "I talked to my manager just now. He knows of some cases where engineers have had bad experiences with him, but not others. Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand. It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. It's easy to say \"don't condescend to your teammates\". It's hard to say what behaviors that entails. reply",

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.).

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

I am rather a bit skeptical of this account as written. One hint: he was told he was meant to be the lead. That's a bit of a shitty promise to be given and taken away. This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant.

If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem.

It’s plausible, sure. But the manager could just as easily be trying to avoid (needed) conflict. To your second point, there’s MANY other explanations. We don’t know how the team reacted for a start - maybe they did back up OP. Or maybe, based on the alleged jerk’s aggressive behaviour to the team in the past, they felt scared to speak up.

But having to go through your manager to force through a totally reasonable decision that is yours to make is being a bad leader. I do not think that there is any alternative interpretation then that this event at least is a failure in leadership. I am saying this because I want to tell OP how his situation sounds to a complete outsider. OP was there if the 9 guys all immediately stood up for him and told the other guy that he was clearly in the wrong, then this obviously disproves everything I said and OP knows that I am wrong. But if they did not, then he should reconsider his actions and at least allow for the possibility that this was a failure on part of his leadership. reply",

          "text": "I think there are four pieces of evidence: - One person on the team does not respect him. That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits? As long as you document the shit out of everything he does wrong, your ass is covered. Best of luck, I can’t stand obnoxious people at work so I hope you can get him his comeuppance. reply",

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure.

It's so overwhelmingly dominant that it eclipses almost every other platform put together, with some exceptions for consoles and mobile. Even when it's targeted at these, Steam is such a powerful marketing/discovery channel for games. When Steam says no AI, nobody does AI. It's not just no AI generated content, some argue it means no brainstorming dialogue via AI and so on. The game dev community selects for this. This means that alternative platforms like Itch tend to also lean towards anti-AI even if they could differentiate by allowing AI. Consoles tend to also build for PC and adopting AI would cost them too much. Pro-AI people tend to move to other platforms like Play Store and App Store, and lately we're seeing more quality control ramp up on these. reply",

Maybe that means you build companion apps, offer an optional subscription tier (often its cloud storage/device sharing based) or something like that.

Big portion will just pay monthly while they wait anyway. Best for all worlds. Otherwise I would maybe recommend a yearly price instead of monthly.

Just look up articles about how SaaS are slowly disappearing and how entrepreneurs should avoid creating SaaS if possible. People usually prefer one-time payments over monthly payments. There are exceptions, usually when the program/service is very valuable and expensive, it makes more sense to just pay for what you use, but in general single payment will always win. Also it depends whether we're talking local or remote service as remote service has inherent cost and having a single payment is not compatible with it. Additionally, there is a distinction between single and ongoing payment in the context of usability. Specifically, it makes little sense to sell a calculator program via a subscription fee but you also reach a limit of the possible customer base. Just like mobile applications. With subscription, you can keep milking the same customer for money indefinitely, but in such case you have to keep providing some services that is worth the payment. reply",

          "text": "In the beginning we sold a product for a one-time fee. Every couple of years we'd release a (paid for) upgrade. The market was young, new features were obvious. The company was funded by \"new sales\". Development, support, admin etc was all funded by sales. As our customers grew, so our costs grew. Support goes up, so fine, we'll offer support contracts. But users typically don't sign up for these (but call support anyway and get pissed if we blow them off, or bill them.) We make \"updates\" and sell those. But to do that we must \"add features\" (customers expect all bug fixes to be free forever). Adding features which offer true value becomes harder. Upgrade sales drop off, but now we have lots of different versions in the field. Obviously sales plateaus at some point. The list of people receiving value goes up, the potential market gets smaller. In short, the source of revenue and the receivers of value are disconnected. This is not sustainable. You are one or two bad sales months from closing up shop. The optimal strategy for this business model is to find the sales peak, terminate all support, and accumulate as much from residual sales as possible. We switched to a subscription model. Now those receiving value (updates, fixes, support, training, features etc) pay a known amount at a known time. We can budget, they can budget. If sales disappear current development and support can continue. (Aka Covid). Income and expenses are aligned. We sell to business not consumers. While consumers might not like subscriptions, businesses love them. They allow for much simpler procurement (no sudden support or upgrade bills), assurance of longevity, reduced capital costs upfront. We can grow headcount based on known income. We can grow sustainably without requiring sales to match. Subscriptions work because the match income to expenses. Those who receive value pay for it in a sustainable way. It's as simple as that. reply",

You're probably not going to save money by spending more time stitching together multiple tools, instead of doing everything at once in Clay. That said, I did compiled some alternatives in my blog awhile ago if you're interested. (Just search for \"Bloomberry Clay alternatives\"). If you're OK with some limitations like less CRM integrations (ie. some only support Hubspot), or less data providers (some use less contact data providers in their waterfall enrichment), then there definitely are some cheaper ones you can try.

We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.<p>I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.<p>I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.<p>This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.<p>I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.<p>P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).<p>P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

This works by supplying commands on the command line, and transitioning to interactive mode when the command list has run out This is all built in-house; the first git commit is from 1997 but that was \"import from CVS\" and already 20k LoC, so the actual origins go back further.

You didn't have to hunt for the right place to look. You pressed the keys, which were buffered, looked to the appropriate part of the screen and more often than not the information you required appeared as you looked.

It's absolutely crazy that a well designed TUI is so much faster. It turns out that if you never change the UI and every menu item always has the same hotkey, navigating the software becomes muscle memory and your speed is only limited by how fast you can physically push the buttons. The program had many menu options added and removed over the decades, but the crucial part is that the hotkeys and menu indexes never, ever changed. Once you learn that you can pop into a quick order menu with this specific sequence of five keys, you just automatically open the right menu the moment a customer walks up. No thought, just pure reflex. UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. No graphical interface I've ever seen comes even close to the raw utility and speed of these finely tuned TUIs. There is a very, very good reason that the oldest and wealthiest retail businesses still use this ancient software. It works, and it's staggeringly effective, and any conceivable replacement will only be worse. There simply is no effective way to improve it. Edit: I will say that these systems take time and effort to learn. You have to commit these UI paths to memory, which isn't too hard, but in order to be maximally effective, you also have to memorize a lot of product metadata. But the key is that it really doesn't take longer than your ordinary training period to become minimally effective. After that, you just pick up the muscle memory as you go. It's pretty analogous to learning touch typing without trying. Your hands just learn where the keys are and after enough time your brain translates words into keystrokes without active thought. It's a beautiful way to design maximally effective software. We've really lost something very important with the shift to GUI and the shunning of text mode. reply",

          "text": "Wegmans’ cash registers still use a TUI. It looks quite clean and friendly compared to the GUI-heavy slop of, say, my time at a major retailer. Speaking of nostalgia, my old gaming store also used a TUI for transactions, and it was highly responsive for anything local (and a PITA anytime it had to communicate with the CO). Also been exposed to a number of businesses these past few years who still use old AIX/Unix/TUI boxes for critical business functions, and most seem happy with them. And therein lies the rub: if the process works, and modern software doesn’t necessarily offer any better value proposition, then there’s no real reason to migrate. For a lot of companies, the status quo might literally be all they’ll ever need, and IT’s role is to just keep it up, available, and secure as times change. Sure, I’ll side-eye a theater using a Windows box as an intermediary for Ticketmaster to run transactions against their old AIX rig collecting dust in a corner of a closet, but if it works and it’s secure, well, more power to them keeping costs down. The advice I’d give is not to knock something just because it doesn’t fit current narratives around technology. Our jobs - first and foremost - are to build and support solutions that amplify productivity of humans in a way they can use without external support; whether it’s an ancient TUI or a modern GUI isn’t as relevant as its efficacy. reply",

I even offered to have one of my students create a nicer UI without changing the engine or database, but by now she's completely used to the terminal menus.

All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

We’re looking for two roles, from mid-senior to senior engineer with at least 5+ years of experience. Backend:  Strong in backend development, ideally Java, but open to those willing to learn. DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role. Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn. Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform. Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas. To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”.

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We’re especially keen to talk to Staff Engineers (backend) and Senior AI Engineers (e.g. LLMs and the scaffolding around, computer-use agents) Even if we don’t have a role out your specific skill set, we’d love to talk!

          "text": "Phrasing.app | Co-founder | EUROPE REMOTE Phrasing is a bootstrapped company dedicated to building the most effective and efficient way to learn a language. I’m a polyglot myself and have always struggled for a few main reasons: 1. Apps only ever focus on taking you from 0-1, never from 1-100. 2. If you have any experience in the language, it’s really hard to pick it up after a few years. 3. Language learning apps are always ugly, clunky, ugly, and just stressful to use. And ugly. 4. No apps support maintaining and learning multiple languages simultaneously 5. Apps only ever support the major languages, leaving minority languages in the dust So, I set off to build my dream language learning application, and a quick 2 years and 10,000 hours later I’d built Phrasing. It’s launched, it’s live, it has (happy) paying daily users, and I myself am using it to learn 18 languages. The product is ready to go, and the business is already growing organically. I’m looking for someone cracked to come in in a co-founding capacity and eventually take over the backend (elixir) codebase from me. No experience is required so long as you’re passionate, talented, and hungry. If you’re interested, and located in Europe, send me an email at hn@phrasing.app. reply",

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_good > In economics, a normal good is a type of a good for which consumers increase their demand due to an increase in income, unlike inferior goods, for which the opposite is observed. When there is an increase in a person's income, for example due to a wage rise, a good for which the demand rises due to the wage increase, is referred as a normal good. Conversely, the demand for normal goods declines when the income decreases, for example due to a wage decrease or layoffs. That explains fairly well, why rich countries all have more-or-less similar health and safety standards despite very different histories and especially histories of labour activism, and why poor countries fare worse in this respect--even if some of them have laws on the books that are just as strict. reply",

Note that I simplified greatly a real assembly line, and there are lots of different lines with different configurations.  Nearly everything is multiple lines.  There are often buffers along the way so that you can get ahead of the line by a little (or if you need to use the restroom the line continues). Sometimes there are two people in a station with the understanding that if both are perfect they are 80-90% busy (or some such number), but if someone is slow the other can help up. Lines often go slower than possible because of safety. There are likely more issues, but there is a point where the line is waiting on the slow person. With the above in mind, what am I missing? reply",

I should clarify that what I'm talking about is fairly basic programming tasks, not very hard leet code style DSA type tasks. I've never been given an actually hard task in an interview, they've all been fairly simple tasks like write a bracket tax calculator, write a class that stores car objects and can get them by plate number and stuff like that. Helped a friend do a take-home one where we fetched some data from spacex's api and displayed it in a html table. Every time I do these, people act like I'm Jesus for solving a relatively simple task. Meanwhile I'm just shocked that this is something my peers struggle with. I would have honestly expected any decent dev to be able to do these with roughly the same proficiency as myself, but it turns out almost nobody can. That's why I think it's a good way to test candidates. If you're going to work as a programmer you should be able to solve these types of tasks. I don't care if you're frontend, backend, finance, healthcare, data science, whatever kind of programming you normally do, you should be able to do these kinds of things. If someone can't then by my judgement they don't really know programming. They may have figured out some way to get things done anyway but I bet the quality of their work reflects their lack of understanding. I've seen a lot of code written by this kind of people, it's very clear that a lot of developers really don't understand the code they're writing.

If AI slop infiltrates projects enterprises are built upon, its likely companies and their customers are metaphorically hurt too, because of a spike in outages etc... (which already happens given AWS got like 7000 outage reports after getting rid of another 14000 employees).

          "text": "Reply intended to user zwnow who is banned by HN, so I cannot reply directly. You confuse intent with reality. The social software under discussion was abused immediately for the criminal purpose of spreading falsehoods about men, both with malicious intent and wilful negligence, which is particularly egregious because the victims were not made aware of the slander. Even if they wanted to defend themselves, they were prevented from doing so because of the institutionalised sexism, men are banned from participating on grounds of their sex alone. The proof for this is in the leaks. You failed to take this into account and hence got downvoted into oblivion, not for the reason you claim. The other facts you write about are part of a different narrative, they are not directly relevant to kanwisher's proposition. IMO, we should not have any tolerance for platforms that are designed for gossip because of the boy-cries-wolf effect in backlash because it means if a woman is a genuine victim, people will take the priors into account and most will assume she's a liar, too, and this lets the perpetrators off the hook. I do not want to live in such a society. The way out of this is holding women accountable, they should be punished for criminal behaviour with immediate and drastic consequences, and tenfold so for their enablers. The problem would stop overnight. reply",

          "text": "The vast majority of PRs are bad. They could even be described as “selfish” in the sense that the “contributor” is haphazardly making whatever change minimally fixes their exact use case without consideration for the project’s style, health, usability, or other users. This isn’t outright malicious or even deliberately inconsiderate, but it still has a negative effect. Refusing such a PR (which, again, is most of them) is easy. But it is also time consuming if you don’t want to be rude. Everything you point out as inadequate is a chance for them to rebut or “fix” in a way which is again unsatisfactory, which only leads to more frustration and wasted time. The solution is to be specific about the project’s goals but vague about the code. Explain why you feel the change doesn‘t align with what you want for the project, but don’t critique specific lines. There are, of course, exceptions. Even when I refuse a PR, if it’s clear it was from a novice with good intentions and making an effort to learn, I’ll still explain the issues at length so they can improve. If it’s someone who obviously used an LLM, didn’t understand anything about what they did and called it a day, I’ll still be polite in my rejection but I’ll also block them.

Some of your ideas have come up in that venue, please go make issues there to discuss your ideas my 2 cents on AI output: these tools are very useful, please wield them in such a way that it respects the time of the human who will be reading your output. This is the longest PR description I have ever read and it does not sound like a human wrote it, nor does it sound like a PR description. The PR also does multiple unrelated things in a single 1k line changeset, which is a nonstarter without prior discussion. I don't doubt your intention is pure, ty for wanting to contribute.

Thoughtful criticism is fine, but please don't be rigidly or generically negative. And like, the problem _is_ *bad*. A fun, on-going issue at work is trying to coordinate with a QA team who believe chatgpt can write css selectors for HTML elements that are not yet written. That same QA team deeply care about the spirit of their work, and are motivated by, the _very_ relatable sentiment of, you DONT FUCKING BREAK USER SPACE. Yeah, in the unbridled, chaotic, raging plasma that is our zeitgeist at the moment, I'm lucky enough to have people dedicating a significant portion of their life to trying to do quality assurance in the idiomatic, industry best-standard way. Blame the FUD, not my team. I would put to you that the observation that they do not (yet) grok what, for lack of a more specific universally understood term we are calling, \"AI\" (or LLMs if you are Fancy. But of course none of these labels are quite right). People need time to observe, and learn. And people are busy with /* gestures around vaguely at everything /*. So yes, we should acknowledge that long-winded trash PRs from AI are a new emergent problem, and yes, if we study the specific problem more closely we will almost certainly find ever more optimal approaches. Writing off the issue as \"stupidity\" is mean. In both senses. reply",

I am looking for a project to work on outside of my personal projects. In my past I developed and maintained various websites for clients, built a mobile application (Flutter), tried a little bit of python scripting for various applications and went back to web developing (PERN). Right now I am learning about ML and NN more as I want to broaden my scope. On a professional/educational level, I am following a Master Degree in Business Modelling and Distributed Computing. During this time I am researching various topics related to the AI field. I am a strong willed individual and fast learner, with great motivation to learn new things and with a great approach to challenges. What I lack experience-wise I make up for in skill and determination. I am willing to work on anything new or not, as anything can be a challenge. reply",

I'm not limiting myself to opportunities using the technologies I already know; I would love to continue growing my technical skills. reply",

Recently, I built a config-driven RAG chatbot platform that delivers grounded, context-aware responses from a VectorStore-backed retrieval pipeline. It’s fully configurable for models and retrieval parameters and includes a LangSmith-based evaluation harness for tracing and regression testing. Before that, I developed an AI insights dashboard using React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, featuring an advanced video player with transcript sync and FFmpeg-based clipping tools to support multimedia insights workflows.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

You built something powerful. Early adopters get it. But broader adoption stalls because the experience doesn't create its own momentum. I specialize in that exact inflection point - making sophisticated tools feel like discovery rather than homework. My approach comes from 10 years running an indie game studio. I apply behavioral psychology to B2B/developer tools. Not gamification - actual intrinsic motivation that makes the 100th use rewarding. Judge for IGF, MagFest, CODiE, GEE, Serious Games awards. Recent work: Semantic analysis mapping 110M+ connections across 1.5M words. Previously: SpicyNodes (40M users), time.gov (pioneering govt web service), medical AI serving 1.5M patients. I lead teams or ship directly via AI-assisted architecture. Looking for Series A-C companies (10-50 people) with products that need to feel less like enterprise Java circa 2003. Developer tools, learning platforms, technical products with adoption friction. Seeking: Head of Product Experience, Director of Developer Experience, or whatever you call the role that makes your product sing.

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

          "text": "AGI is artificial general intelligence. It is defined in contrast to so-called \"narrow\" intelligence, which is AI systems limited to specific problem domains. This has always been a well-accepted definition, at least prior to the recent AI boom. In 2006 no one would have questioned this -- you can go find books and conference journals from this time that discuss AGI with this very specific definition. What happened was: over the 8 years between 2006 - 2014, a particularly vocal and organized group of fringe singletarians promoted the idea that once AGI is achieved (the originally well-defined conception of AGI), it will rapidly undergo recursive self-improvement and emerge as a singularly powerful entity with absolute power and control. The debate was whether this would happen in mere hours/days (fast takeoff) or months (slow takeoff). These nutcases would go on to take founding roles first at DeepMind, then OpenAI, and later Anthropic & other foundational labs. That they would achieve AGI and then neither of those outcomes come to pass was not in their range of predictions. Rather than admit to themselves that their analysis was wrong, they move goal posts: ChatGPT isn't real AGI. Real AGI would have taken over the world, so that can't be it. It is circular reasoning. No, it is real AGI. Real AGI didn't cause a singularity because intelligence actually doesn't matter as much as a bunch of autistic smart internet people think it does. reply",

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

The setups people use tend to be quite different, as do their opinions on packages, so I doubt there is a single satisfactory and agreed upon \"source of truth\". Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there. So I would not recommend those to new users, at least not if you would like to learn the basics and get a better hang of it, to be able to debug it, though some seem to be happy with those. reply",

I simply found those to be more useful once I fully understood the power that comes with a fully reprogrammable editor. There is a learning curve and there is also a mental model to adopt, and I think that adopting the mental model is easier when starting raw and building up from scratch. Once you feel comfortable maybe try spacemacs or doom to see if they offer advantages for your workflow. I also highly recommend the resources at https://www.masteringemacs.org reply",

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

There's also Protesilaos' Stavrou channel on YouTube with a good amount of videos covering Emacs' topics in depth. I highly recommend them. (Btw, I still don't know what Vertigo and Consult provide, but I can navigate through files, text search and replacement, functions and all with comfort, so not sure if I'm missing something.) reply",

Vertico add incremental completion and present the candidates in a vertical list, so it’s more like filtering than completions. Consult provides a lot of collections for completions and some niceties on top of some existing completion sources. Two of its main features are narrowing (kinda like selectibg a subcollection) and asynchronous sources (you can have something like ripgrep powering the sources of completion candidates). reply",

For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box. I can steal this tmux session from any new connection. It also survives if the machine I'm sshing from dies or reboots. I can't think of a way to make it work with GUI emacs. reply",

I 99% of the time use emacs in a terminal. 90% of the time over ssh or in a non-GUI VM/docker etc. I usually install emacs-nox to speed up the install. Vanilla emacs is fine. Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess. I do have one little elisp function that tries to find and open the header file for the C file I'm  currently in, or the c, cc, cpp, c++ file for the header file I'm in.

So even if you added some modification late at night/under influence of substances, you can still tell that you were thinking and easily switch it off or improve it.

So for instance, you might have: ~/.ssh/config.d/10-general.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/20-work.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/30-github.conf Can confirm this works great in teams or on multi-host setups, as it keeps things organized without cluttering a single massive config file and it works across tools like ssh, scp, rsync, etc. reply",

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

Understandably, some people complain that it shouldn't need a tutorial or the defaults are bad. There's validity to that angle. There's also validity to Emacs pre-dating GUIs, the IBM keyboard, and the x86 instruction set. Once you get past the history of windows and killing, you can explore. The history is also super interesting! https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?EmacsHistory https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386324 After you've read the tutorial, go wild. Try stuff out. Break things. Fix them. Learn your limits. Learn that there are very few limits imposed by Emacs itself. Hands down, the best resource for Emacs is Emacs itself. Especially, the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual. The \"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp\" is also excellent if you're not familiar with Lisp. Learn to read Info files and learn the help system (basically C-h f and C-h v) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ Emacs really is a flagship of Freedom, with all its pain and glory. It lets you exist at the threshold of your zone of proximal development. Every bit you put into Emacs, you get a return on investment. Welcome to the Emacs community! It's full of weirdos and wizards, as well as regular folk. Stick around and I'm sure you'll make friends in no time. reply",

          "text": "I sometimes still code with a local LLM but can't imagine doing it on a laptop. I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

          "text": "> gpt-oss-120b is amazing Yup, I agree, easily best local model you can run today on local hardware, especially when reasoning_effort is set to \"high\", but \"medium\" does very well too. I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

Same with the Mac mini, get the studio instead, it has a fan, the Mini does not. I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline. I do think Macs are phenomenal at running local LLMs if you get the right one. reply",

I couldnt find any good intro on the web-of-ads.  It's not much help with Zig, but then nothing seems to keep up with Zig at the moment. I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats? [edit] be sure to use it powered, linux is a bit battery heavy, but Qwen3 will pull 60W+ and flatten a battery real fast. reply",

After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users.

You are probably downloading one of these two ids: `granite4:small-h` or `granite4:32b-a9b-h`. The \"small\" model _is_ small in relative terms, but is also the largest of the currently released granite models!

All the software is implemented by myself, but I started out with basically calling out to llama.cpp, as it was the simplest and fastest option that let me integrate it into my own software without requiring a GUI.

Desktop, Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB of RAM, RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM), performs very well and I can run most of the models I use daily all together, unless I want really large context then just GPT-OSS-120B + max context, ends up taking ~70GB of VRAM. > What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short).

As long as you give the local LLM access to a search tool (I use YaCy + my own adapter), local models works better for me than the hosted models, mainly because of the speed and I have better control over the inference. It does fall short on really complicated stuff. Right now I'm trying to do CUDA programming, creating a fused MoE kernel for inference in Rust, and it's a bit tricky as there are a lot of moving parts and I don't understand the subject 100%, and when you get to that point, it's a bit hit or miss. You really need to have a proper understanding of what you use the LLM for, otherwise it breaks down quickly. Divide and conquer as always helps a lot. reply",

On both i have setup lemonade-server on system start.\nAt work i use Qwen3 Coder 30B-3A with continue.dev. It serves me well in 90% of cases. At home i have 128GB RAM. I try a bit GPT120B. I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes. But i would like to allow parallel requests, so i need to tinker a bit more. Maybe llama-swap is enough. I just need to see how to deal with context length. My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM). Btw. even a AMD HX 370 with non soldered RAM can get some nice t/s for smaller models. \nCan be helpful enough when disconnected from internet and you dont know how to style a svg :) Thanks for opening up this topic!

It runs Ollama + Open WebUI with GPT-OSS 120b as well as GLM4.5-Air (default quantisations). I rarely ever use ChatGPT anymore. Love that all data stays at home. I connect remotely only via VPN (my phone enables this automatically via Tasker). I'm 50% brainstorming ideas with it, asking critical questions and learning something new. The other half is actual development, where I describe very clearly what I know I'll need (usually in TODOs in comments) and it will write those snippets, which is my preferred way of AI-assistance. I stay in the driver seat; the model becomes the copilot. Human-in-the-loop and such. Worked really well for my website development, other personal projects and even professionally (my work laptop has its own Open WebUI account for separation). reply",

However after 25 years I was still shooting myself in the foot on the regular. I evaluate Go, Rust and fpc. I'm too dumb for Rust, Go's was close but lack of exceptions and classes made it not for me. Fpc hit the sweet spot. The syntax is a little clunky but I have classes when I need them, exception handling, memory management - both auto and manual and cross platform support.

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

That was not an FP invention, though. Delphi already did it - they kept the Apple's Object Pascal constructs from Turbo Pascal, and then bolted a whole new object system in parallel. FP inherited that mess and has to maintain it for backwards compatibility reasons. That said, given that the two systems are completely orthogonal, you can simply ignore the older one. The biggest thing going in favor of FP is that it has been around for almost 30 years now, so it's very mature. reply",

Most of the complexity involved comes from supporting a language in which data is expected to be both shared and mutable as a matter of course. I feel like we live in a world where everyone works very hard to pretend that C is our best low-level language, when in reality an APL-like purely functional array language would be a better candidate. reply",

Before this current job I was a JavaScript developer. JavaScript for employment is like elementary school teacher in the public school system when compared to the US education system. Sure there are many elementary school teachers that are absolutely amazing, but most will never hold the same intellectual capacity as a tenured university professor. My learning from this is if you wish to do more then don’t find yourself in a place where you are competing with entitled children. reply",

          "text": "Out of full time jobs (not including the freelance work): 4 jobs via Facebook (notably a top 50 YC backed unicorn). One direct referral. One from a job board. One from a university alumni group where I was the committee. One from LinkedIn. I \"blog\" a lot on social media, so most of the FB jobs \"found me\". But for my first job, I went through my friend list one by one and asked for jobs because 3 months on job sites weren't turning up anything. In the recent 5 years, LinkedIn has far surpassed FB for leads. Job boards are terrible. One rejected me while I was interviewing (got the interview via HN). One rejected me while I was in the office. Recruiters bring in a lot of high quality leads (highest being TikTok). But 0% success rate for me. One told me that I was ghosted for a role, but when I applied directly for that exact role later, I got it within 2 weeks of application. Sending out emails/DMs to C-levels and asking for a job actually has a good interview rate, but for startups. Most couldn't afford the usual rate, but if I were desperate, I'd do this. reply",

It's hard to get work done when you can't get any testing, can't get any infra or PM support, have to do everything yourself in a vaccum. Have to run apps on a server in the closet. You don’t quit a job until you have another one lined up.  You do your work the best you can for 40 hours a week and leave.  If you don’t get all of your work done and they fire you, at least you kept getting a paycheck longer.

You saw that last response I had?  I care about doing the best job I can given circumstances outside of my “circle of influence” for 40 hours a week and then I go home.  Every pay period money get deposited in my account and depending on the job RSUs get deposited in my brokerage account every vesting period. As soon as I get off work, I don’t think about it until the next day. > First time in my life I \"chose myself\" and quit a job instead of staying in something that was very negatively affecting my mental health. It's been hard to find a way to get back into employment without addressing fears of hostile, toxic work environments. What you described is neither hostile or toxic.

Don’t let your pride or frustrating keep you from exchanging labor for money to support your addiction to food and shelter. I don't know what to tell you other than the only different course of action was to kill myself and I didn't want to do that. Repeated trauma in multiple workplaces has effectively robbed me of my career. It's not all the fault of the employers I had, but it's also not 100% my fault either. I struggle with self worth because I cannot understand what my value is anymore. The experiences I have keep telling me I am worth less and less. People are less willing to hire me, to pay me, to even listen to what I have to say. Having all of this playing in your head 24/7 makes it impossible to view authority as anything but abusive and willfully ignorant. I know they aren't all like that... but then why does this keep happening to me? I want to go back but I don't know how. It's more than just someone being fussy there is something seriously psychologically wrong, but outwardly I \"look\" fine so I must be faking it / doing it for attention. I am tired of pandering to the people who refuse to see me. > What you described is neither hostile or toxic. I... didn't even describe the toxic work experiences I have had. The entire impetus to take the actions I did are not written in this post on purpose. I don't want to muddy the waters with conjecture and hearsay. Having been through a nightmare and being told \"that wasn't toxic\" is the kind of mindset that I am terrified of interacting with (being abused by) in the workplace. reply",

As a bonus, the court might issue, sua sponte , an order to show cause why sanctions ought not be imposed anyway. But say the client is very cost-sensitive. There, one can still make a bullet-point list  of all the cases cited, placing them under the heading \"Cases that Do Not Exist\" or similar. The court should get the idea.

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

Thank goodness for both of you. Your team would be worse for it if they lacked either. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.). Curious as the advice rings sound, but I only saw your consultancy work. reply",

Three outcomes in order of likelihood: - they take the hint and leave - they improve enough to get the PIP off them - you have justification for disciplinary actions including termination. It’s a drain on your time and energy, but it’s a sure fire way to create an actionable record of this employees bad behaviour.

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

Give him important jobs etc. It's easier after you go for drink/coffee and become a bit more chill with each other. And if he fails on something sensitive that you gave him then you don't have to struggle for proof to management that he sucks But maybe BE prepared to confront if he starts it? Maybe it's just me but it's dreadful if you bring it up and this guy shoots you down with some snark and you freeze out of surprise and lose the meeting. I would if you are value to company and he is really being an outright asshole on this meeting be prepared to say \"look if you're not gonna genuinely cooperate as your lead I'll officially file a complaint/recommend to boot you from this team/whatever\" and leave.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

          "text": "This sounds incredibly frustrating. But given you're in the leadership seat, it's worth taking a hard look\nat yourself asking how you're playing a role in this, especially since it's unlikely people are this difficult for no reason. I am rather a bit skeptical of this account as written. One hint: he was told he was meant to be the lead. That's a bit of a shitty promise to be given and taken away. This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...). Which kinda shows that your manager does not agree with your viewpoint. If you take his words at face value, he is pretty much telling you that you are the problem. Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities.

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

I seriously doubt he will begin to treat you any differently unless he has some fear put in him (and a slim chance even if that happens) I would suggest that to come out on top here that you need to pitch a perfect game from here on out, even if it means following some suggestion from this guy or something. Being correct and being willing to verbalize when you don’t know something or don’t know the ideal answer to a situation is the number one trick to establishing a reputation as a rockstar IMO. That may give you a lot of sway. Keep a great paper trail both on this guy and to cover your own ass. I would probably begin building a case to fire him, aka “managing him out”. I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits? As long as you document the shit out of everything he does wrong, your ass is covered. Best of luck, I can’t stand obnoxious people at work so I hope you can get him his comeuppance. reply",

Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.]\nSo, that's why I advised to better understand what is going on.

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness.

We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.<p>I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.<p>I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.<p>This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.<p>I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.<p>P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).<p>P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Many (most?) older retail businesses still use TUIs. They're reliable, consistent, and orders of magnitude faster than GUI systems. When I worked ar Sherwin Williams, I got good enough with the TUI that customers could rattle off their orders while I punch it into the computer in real time. It's absolutely crazy that a well designed TUI is so much faster. It turns out that if you never change the UI and every menu item always has the same hotkey, navigating the software becomes muscle memory and your speed is only limited by how fast you can physically push the buttons. The program had many menu options added and removed over the decades, but the crucial part is that the hotkeys and menu indexes never, ever changed. Once you learn that you can pop into a quick order menu with this specific sequence of five keys, you just automatically open the right menu the moment a customer walks up. No thought, just pure reflex. UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. No graphical interface I've ever seen comes even close to the raw utility and speed of these finely tuned TUIs. There is a very, very good reason that the oldest and wealthiest retail businesses still use this ancient software. It works, and it's staggeringly effective, and any conceivable replacement will only be worse. There simply is no effective way to improve it. Edit: I will say that these systems take time and effort to learn. You have to commit these UI paths to memory, which isn't too hard, but in order to be maximally effective, you also have to memorize a lot of product metadata. But the key is that it really doesn't take longer than your ordinary training period to become minimally effective. After that, you just pick up the muscle memory as you go. It's pretty analogous to learning touch typing without trying. Your hands just learn where the keys are and after enough time your brain translates words into keystrokes without active thought. It's a beautiful way to design maximally effective software. We've really lost something very important with the shift to GUI and the shunning of text mode. reply",

For several years, MacOS followed a strong UX convention with consistent keyboard shortcuts, menus, layout order, and more. Similarly, Microsoft started with the same, but with everything reversed. At the time, most major cross-platform apps followed these conventions. Two periods broke these rules: the expansion of web apps and Apple's pivot towards the consolidation of everything into iOS. First was the dawn of web apps. Faced with two opposing standards, web apps didn't know which model to follow. Business sites stuck with MS standards, while design-centric sites followed Mac standards. As those broke consistency, cross-platform apps gave up and defined their own standards. Mobile platforms tried to establish new standards. iOS was mostly successful, but started slipping around iOS 7. Material Design was supposed to standardize Android, but Google used it for all Google products, making it more of a standard for the Google brand than Android. The second started around WWDC 2019. At that point, Apple deprioritized UX standards to focus on architecture updates. The following year, Catalyst was literally a UX catalyst, introducing two competing UX standards for MacOS. From that point forward, Apple really hasn't had a singular UX standard to follow anymore, but they seem to be marching towards iOS standards for all devices. reply",

While in many ways it was better than the GUIs we have now , using the mouse was an absolute must , which prevented it from ever getting as efficient as a TUI.

I think sublime text was one of the first to bring the TUI style super-powers into the modern desktop UK, where you press some random keyboard shortcut (e.g. cmd-p in sublime) and you can instantly start typing a command. Another thought I have had for a long time is that when GUIs like Mac and Windows were taking off, they were often described as more \"user friendly\" than TUIs. I always thought this depended on the kind of user. A lot of effort went into prioritising making it possible for an untrained user to use a system, but making it fast for someone with experience was no longer important. reply",

With a TUI there is a hard limit on the amount of data you can load and that helps as a starting point. - Often it's hitting a server is that is far away rather in the same building. - you can put the web server in the same building - Each page is very heavy with lots of JavaScript etc. loading - you can build lightweight web pages if you priority small script size, minimal dependencies,\n    and do profiling to keep things in check - Data loading delays rendering - limit the amount of data loaded and displayed at one time - Data is slow to load - an older system has limited capacity meaning it's not an option to keep inactive data around\n  - this means data is more likely to be indexed\n  - new systems have very large storage capacities, leading to a larger and larger growing db\n  - eventually default configuration for the database does not allow for everything active to be indexed\n  - solution is to keep inactive data out of active tables being queried for normal operations - Slow to navigate with mouse - you can create a keyboard navigation system\n  - you can build keyboard shortcuts into every screen\n  - you can create autocomplete shortcut commands to jump to screens reply",

Oh, I’ve been a new hire at places like this. The day1 stuff in the system will be logically or coherently placed (e.g. alphabetically) and then the rest will be incrementally added on top. The menu options will go like this: 1. Alpha 2. Bravo 3. Charlie 4. Turbo-Bravo 5. Charlie-Undo 6. AAAlpha Great for day1 users that are still there and started with just 3 options but new users are screwed. The arrangement started to stop making sense circa 1995. I’ve seen the same thing where parts shelves were sorted by manufacturer (to make re-ordering by manufacturer simple). When they moved to automatic inventory, shelves didn’t matter anymore and if a part was made by manu1 but now manu2, they’d keep putting it with manu1 because “that’s where everyone’s gone to look for it for the part 20 years”. All you had to know was who made that part in 2003 when auto-inventory stopped forcing them to be consistent by manufacturer to know which shelf to pick from. Easy! New hires get screwed and over time nothing makes sense anymore. reply",

There's a reason why keybindings are today called \"shortcuts\": Steve Jobs's diktat was that the primary means of giving commands to the Mac was the mouse. Anything you can do on a Mac (except for entering text) was to be done with, and designed around, the mouse. Keyboard \"shortcuts\", so called as a quicker way to issue (some, but not all) menu commands, were a sop to power users but really were an addition, not essential to use of the program. Windows, by contrast, was designed to be keyboard-accessible. Not all PCs in 1985 had mice... reply",

Often these kinds of systems do run faster than the input, but when they don't, it still works.

In 2020 it suddenly came to a halt, because the date pickers just couldn't go further than 2019. Nobody seemed to care in 1992 when it was released. It was really easy to de-compile the Visual Basic 3 software (perfectly legal where I live). My first idea was to get the source cleaned up a bit and compile it again to 32 bit with Visual Basic 4, but I couldn't figure it out, it required some 3rd party libraries that I just couldn't get a hold of. In the end I just changed the number 2019 in the binary to 2059 in a hex editor, and it just worked. There was only one occurrence of the number 2019 in the whole binary. I guess I got really lucky. Edit: It seems like Windows and Visual Basic are not affected by the Unix 2038 problem at all. 16 bit Windows seems to be fine until the year 2107. reply",

This was super common for VB apps. The original architecture of VB was, loosely speaking, a GUI container for various pluggable controls connected to a BASIC runtime. The number of controls that came in the box would vary depending on how fancy a version of VB you bought, and you could plug in additional third party controls in the form of \"VBX's\" - Visual Basic eXtensions. Even though VBX's were designed mainly for GUI controls, they were the easiest extension point for VB and got extensively used for all sorts of integrations until OLE Automation became more prevalent.

Because the TUI forced keyboard interaction everyone was quick, and we could all fly through the screens finding what we wanted. One benefit was each screen was a fixed size and there was no scroll, so when you pressed the right incantation the answer you wanted appeared in the same portion of the screen every time. You didn't have to hunt for the right place to look. You pressed the keys, which were buffered, looked to the appropriate part of the screen and more often than not the information you required appeared as you looked. Moving to a web based system meant we all had to use mice and spend our days moving them to the correct button on the page all the time. It added hours and hours to the processing.

          "text": "I like it! It's an interesting and under-explored direction. However, I would suggest you take your idea in its current form as only a starting point, and continue working on it. If you could also collaborate with someone who can offer a woman's perspective on this, I think that would improve things. I am saying that because I am a dude, and, to be honest, just based on this post, I suspect you are as well. My experience of being happily married and also a father of a young lady has taught me that a woman's perspective on these matters is very different from ours, and it's something that I previously had no idea about. It's especially important because, as everyone knows, whether any such initiative *succeeds or fails* is determined by whether it can attract women. You get them, and the men *will* flock wherever the women are. Specifically: *Prioritize the lowest-friction way for women to avoid certain men*\nIn this context, it's very important for women to have a *low-social-friction* way to *minimize* being *around* certain men. The reasons could range from objectively problematic things like unwelcome and inappropriate advances to more \"subjective\" (or \"unfair\") things that women often won't be willing to express—like someone with perceived poor hygiene or just \"giving *off* the wrong vibes.\" And the hard part is that while in theory you can do something about the objective stuff (banning people based on the *post-event* survey), the subjective, *unspoken stuff* is much harder to tackle. One underappreciated property of every *common* way to *socialize* with strangers or \"meet people\" is the ability for women to \"walk away\" with the lowest possible friction. For example, the concept of a \"date\" *where* you meet in a public, neutral, anonymous place largely originates from that. With that in mind, the perspective of being \"trapped\" and \"cooped up\" in an escape room for *an hour* with men *they don't know* looks very different. *Lean into an activity with friends where you expand your offline social network* This activity would do well by leaning *into* the aspects of traditional ways to meet people that the matching apps are bad at. *Think about* the advantages of the classic practice of being invited to a party and going there with your friends. For socially mature people (exactly the kind everyone seeks), and in particular for women, an activity you can go to *with your* group of friends, rather than alone, is much more attractive and natural. And there are significant social advantages to meeting a person at a *friend's* party. First of all, the person meets the minimal social bar of being *sociable enough* to have at least one friendship that led them to be invited to a party by a friend *or* acquaintance. (*And* if you think that's not much, *you'd be surprised*.) Another reason is that when you meet a person through your social network (friend-of-a-friend), you get to learn *what* they are really like. This is huge: without it, all a guy who is a serial abuser needs to do is to act charming and nice for an hour or two during the date. *Plausible deniability. Don't repeat the mistakes of speed-dating.*\nI would think about changing at least the official *value proposition* of the idea from \"meet potential dates\" to something more neutral, a sort of fun and exciting activity where \"meeting *new people*\" is only mentioned in passing. For whatever complex social reason, it seems that there is this socially important thing, in particular for women, that even when meeting potential new dates is the ultimate intention for many participants, the *appearance has to be kept* that it's not the *main* reason people are participating. Look at the concept of *nightlife* and nightclubs, *for example*. Why do *girls* go out and hit the nightclubs? To dance and to have a great time with their girlfriends, of course! Because the best way to spend time with friends *over* deafeningly loud music, in a dark ugly warehouse, is to dress up, commute *downtown* (taxi *fare* both ways), wait in a line, and spend a fortune on the cheapest booze. On the other hand, while objectively \"speed dating\" is a great proposition, it *hasn't been* popular at all. Here are some directions *you could explore* iterating on the idea: 1.  I would change the setting from the escape room with 4-6 people to some sort of *outside quest-style* game (*geocaching-style*, clues, and so on) where larger groups of people participate (10-20), and the players have the opportunity *to* team up with others if they wish. Maybe it could be two or *multiple* teams so *the* whole vibe moves from \"meeting dates\" to a *\"sports\" or competition* vibe. 2.  Invite-only, members with good standing get 5 invites *to* share with their friends and all that. Compose teams so that you get to meet *friends-of-friends* rather than total strangers. 3.  I would switch from the \"meet dates\" rhetoric to just an activity you can do with friends, and, *hey*, you meet people. 4.  I would change the anonymous post-game matching mechanic from being matched up for \"dating\" to being matched up to participate together at the next game, or being matched up in the same team. reply",

It applies to things like road rage too - fear and anger are physiologically very similar and the body will combine the two. Anxiety is also excitement, and so on. Things that create fear and anger could possibly improve arousal rates as well. I'm also thinking team synergy like who's protecting who, who takes lead, who tries to save themselves. reply",

This isn't a job; it's a strategic partnership. We are Relationship Media, LLC, a leadership education company founded by a 20-year law enforcement veteran and former S.W.A.T. commander. We have a proven, \"sticky\" training program that solves the single biggest problem in organizations today: The Relationship Gap. We’re not selling abstract theory. We sell a practical, example-driven blueprint for leadership (using our proprietary \"Be Like Tony & Don't Be Like Chad\" framework) that helps organizations in public service, manufacturing, and healthcare solve their $223 billion crisis of cultural disconnection. We have the product. We're looking for partners who have the relationships. The Opportunity: Two Ways to Earn\nWe are recruiting a small team of commission-based partners to bring this vital training to their networks. 1. The Certified Partner (White-Label):\nThis is for independent consultants, coaches, and trainers. We will white-label our entire online course with your brand, logo, and welcome video. It becomes your product. You sell it to your clients and keep a significant portion of the revenue. Stop trading your time for money and add a scalable, recurring income stream to your practice. 2. The Affiliate Partner (Referral-Based):\nThis is for retired executives and well-connected professionals. You make high-level introductions to your network (City Managers, Police/Fire Chiefs, Plant Managers, HR VPs). When we close a deal for in-person or online training, you earn a generous referral commission. You leverage your credibility; we do the rest. Who We Are Looking For:\n• Profile 1: The Independent Consultant. You are an HR, OD, or leadership consultant, etc., looking for a proven, high-quality curriculum to sell to your existing clients.\n• Profile 2: The \"Encore Career\" Executive. You are a retired/semi-retired leader (e.g., City Manager, Police/Fire Chief, HR Director, Operations VP, etc.) who wants to leverage your network for a flexible, lucrative, and meaningful opportunity. This is a 100% commission-based partnership for established professionals who understand that their relationships are their most valuable asset. If you are a high-level connector ready to monetize your network by solving a real-world problem, we want to talk to you. Lean more/apply at: http://partnership.relationshipmedia.net/ reply",

All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

          "text": "Ascento | Zurich, Switzerland | Full Stack | https://www.ascento.ai Ascento develops autonomous security robots that patrol outdoor areas to detect and report. All in support of security guards. We stay away from conflict, just robots driving circles around buildings in remote boring places. The technical challenges however, are far from boring. We are looking for a full stack engineer to join as a core member of the off-robot software team. This is the software that plans, configures, operates and creates insights from data collected from the robots. You would work across the whole cloud-stack, consisting of Frontend (React), Backend (Typescript / Go), Infra (Terraform / AWS / GCP). The cloud software team is still small, meaning you get a chance to help set priorities, guide long-term architectural direction and figure out how to best help our users. We celebrate pragmatism, we work hard to make simple systems and we help each other to hyperfocus. Sounds like the place for you? Drop an email to sijmen@ascento.ai.

DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role. Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn. Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform. Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas. To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”.

          "text": "Phrasing.app | Co-founder | EUROPE REMOTE Phrasing is a bootstrapped company dedicated to building the most effective and efficient way to learn a language. I’m a polyglot myself and have always struggled for a few main reasons: 1. Apps only ever focus on taking you from 0-1, never from 1-100. 2. If you have any experience in the language, it’s really hard to pick it up after a few years. 3. Language learning apps are always ugly, clunky, ugly, and just stressful to use. And ugly. 4. No apps support maintaining and learning multiple languages simultaneously 5. Apps only ever support the major languages, leaving minority languages in the dust So, I set off to build my dream language learning application, and a quick 2 years and 10,000 hours later I’d built Phrasing. It’s launched, it’s live, it has (happy) paying daily users, and I myself am using it to learn 18 languages. The product is ready to go, and the business is already growing organically. I’m looking for someone cracked to come in in a co-founding capacity and eventually take over the backend (elixir) codebase from me. No experience is required so long as you’re passionate, talented, and hungry. If you’re interested, and located in Europe, send me an email at hn@phrasing.app. reply",

They could even be described as “selfish” in the sense that the “contributor” is haphazardly making whatever change minimally fixes their exact use case without consideration for the project’s style, health, usability, or other users. This isn’t outright malicious or even deliberately inconsiderate, but it still has a negative effect. Refusing such a PR (which, again, is most of them) is easy. But it is also time consuming if you don’t want to be rude. Everything you point out as inadequate is a chance for them to rebut or “fix” in a way which is again unsatisfactory, which only leads to more frustration and wasted time. The solution is to be specific about the project’s goals but vague about the code. Explain why you feel the change doesn‘t align with what you want for the project, but don’t critique specific lines. There are, of course, exceptions. Even when I refuse a PR, if it’s clear it was from a novice with good intentions and making an effort to learn, I’ll still explain the issues at length so they can improve. If it’s someone who obviously used an LLM, didn’t understand anything about what they did and called it a day, I’ll still be polite in my rejection but I’ll also block them.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_good > In economics, a normal good is a type of a good for which consumers increase their demand due to an increase in income, unlike inferior goods, for which the opposite is observed. When there is an increase in a person's income, for example due to a wage rise, a good for which the demand rises due to the wage increase, is referred as a normal good. Conversely, the demand for normal goods declines when the income decreases, for example due to a wage decrease or layoffs. That explains fairly well, why rich countries all have more-or-less similar health and safety standards despite very different histories and especially histories of labour activism, and why poor countries fare worse in this respect--even if some of them have laws on the books that are just as strict. reply",

Note that I simplified greatly a real assembly line, and there are lots of different lines with different configurations.  Nearly everything is multiple lines.  There are often buffers along the way so that you can get ahead of the line by a little (or if you need to use the restroom the line continues). Sometimes there are two people in a station with the understanding that if both are perfect they are 80-90% busy (or some such number), but if someone is slow the other can help up. Lines often go slower than possible because of safety. There are likely more issues, but there is a point where the line is waiting on the slow person.

I should clarify that what I'm talking about is fairly basic programming tasks, not very hard leet code style DSA type tasks. I've never been given an actually hard task in an interview, they've all been fairly simple tasks like write a bracket tax calculator, write a class that stores car objects and can get them by plate number and stuff like that. Helped a friend do a take-home one where we fetched some data from spacex's api and displayed it in a html table. Every time I do these, people act like I'm Jesus for solving a relatively simple task. Meanwhile I'm just shocked that this is something my peers struggle with. I would have honestly expected any decent dev to be able to do these with roughly the same proficiency as myself, but it turns out almost nobody can. That's why I think it's a good way to test candidates. If you're going to work as a programmer you should be able to solve these types of tasks. I don't care if you're frontend, backend, finance, healthcare, data science, whatever kind of programming you normally do, you should be able to do these kinds of things. If someone can't then by my judgement they don't really know programming. They may have figured out some way to get things done anyway but I bet the quality of their work reflects their lack of understanding. I've seen a lot of code written by this kind of people, it's very clear that a lot of developers really don't understand the code they're writing.

That Tea app was a good example for that, endangering thousands of women by leaking private conversations and address data. If AI slop infiltrates projects enterprises are built upon, its likely companies and their customers are metaphorically hurt too, because of a spike in outages etc... (which already happens given AWS got like 7000 outage reports after getting rid of another 14000 employees). Yes AI can be cool, but can we stop being this blind regarding its limitations, usecases, how its actually used, how it actually benefits humanity, and so on?

          "text": "Reply intended to user zwnow who is banned by HN, so I cannot reply directly. You confuse intent with reality. The social software under discussion was abused immediately for the criminal purpose of spreading falsehoods about men, both with malicious intent and wilful negligence, which is particularly egregious because the victims were not made aware of the slander. Even if they wanted to defend themselves, they were prevented from doing so because of the institutionalised sexism, men are banned from participating on grounds of their sex alone. The proof for this is in the leaks. You failed to take this into account and hence got downvoted into oblivion, not for the reason you claim. The other facts you write about are part of a different narrative, they are not directly relevant to kanwisher's proposition. IMO, we should not have any tolerance for platforms that are designed for gossip because of the boy-cries-wolf effect in backlash because it means if a woman is a genuine victim, people will take the priors into account and most will assume she's a liar, too, and this lets the perpetrators off the hook. I do not want to live in such a society. The way out of this is holding women accountable, they should be punished for criminal behaviour with immediate and drastic consequences, and tenfold so for their enablers. The problem would stop overnight. reply",

This is the longest PR description I have ever read and it does not sound like a human wrote it, nor does it sound like a PR description. The PR also does multiple unrelated things in a single 1k line changeset, which is a nonstarter without prior discussion. I don't doubt your intention is pure, ty for wanting to contribute.

Thoughtful criticism is fine, but please don't be rigidly or generically negative. And like, the problem _is_ *bad*. A fun, on-going issue at work is trying to coordinate with a QA team who believe chatgpt can write css selectors for HTML elements that are not yet written. That same QA team deeply care about the spirit of their work, and are motivated by, the _very_ relatable sentiment of, you DONT FUCKING BREAK USER SPACE. Yeah, in the unbridled, chaotic, raging plasma that is our zeitgeist at the moment, I'm lucky enough to have people dedicating a significant portion of their life to trying to do quality assurance in the idiomatic, industry best-standard way. Blame the FUD, not my team. I would put to you that the observation that they do not (yet) grok what, for lack of a more specific universally understood term we are calling, \"AI\" (or LLMs if you are Fancy. But of course none of these labels are quite right). People need time to observe, and learn. And people are busy with /* gestures around vaguely at everything /*. So yes, we should acknowledge that long-winded trash PRs from AI are a new emergent problem, and yes, if we study the specific problem more closely we will almost certainly find ever more optimal approaches. Writing off the issue as \"stupidity\" is mean. In both senses. reply",

I am a dedicated Fullstack-Developer with a knack for thoroughness. I’ve built and maintained CRUD applications for various companies and customers over the last 6 years. I can work with and help out with agile procedures. Particular strengths of mine are requirement analysis, database schema design and frontend development. I thrive in teams that are eager to improve, seek consensus, and value discussions, technical or otherwise. I am a bad fit for teams that seek to avoid conversations. I am looking exclusively for jobs where 20-24 hours is a possibility. If that sounds right for you, send me a mail. I am happy to hear from you! reply",

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a entry or mid-level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

As far as keeping up with whats latest and greatest, I think the real answer is there isn't a good online resource. There are emacs meetups and conferences and some are virtual, and you can ask around other power users and see what they are doing. I even find emacs packages to be pretty poor at selling themselves on why you should use them.

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

The setups people use tend to be quite different, as do their opinions on packages, so I doubt there is a single satisfactory and agreed upon \"source of truth\". Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there. So I would not recommend those to new users, at least not if you would like to learn the basics and get a better hang of it, to be able to debug it, though some seem to be happy with those. reply",

There is a learning curve and there is also a mental model to adopt, and I think that adopting the mental model is easier when starting raw and building up from scratch.

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

I started by reading Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen and from there start adding things that I felt I needed (configure key bindings, project.el, eglot, LSP things, helm, corfu, vterm, flycheck, etc) I still have things to do, but I'm not in a hurry, I'm quite comfortable with Emacs right now, so will approach them shortly. There's also Protesilaos' Stavrou channel on YouTube with a good amount of videos covering Emacs' topics in depth. I highly recommend them. (Btw, I still don't know what Vertigo and Consult provide, but I can navigate through files, text search and replacement, functions and all with comfort, so not sure if I'm missing something.) reply",

Vertico add incremental completion and present the candidates in a vertical list, so it’s more like filtering than completions. Consult provides a lot of collections for completions and some niceties on top of some existing completion sources. Two of its main features are narrowing (kinda like selectibg a subcollection) and asynchronous sources (you can have something like ripgrep powering the sources of completion candidates). reply",

Sure, there are some features you can only access via gui, but I'd say they are extremely minimal in my workflow: - real buttons in GUI - rendering inline images/LaTeX - varies fonts (eg font sizes) There may be others but I can't think of them. Neither of the above is things I do more often than a handful of times a year. Meanwhile, terminal Emacs plays well with tmux and SSH which I do a lot of. For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box. I can steal this tmux session from any new connection. It also survives if the machine I'm sshing from dies or reboots. I can't think of a way to make it work with GUI emacs. reply",

I 99% of the time use emacs in a terminal. 90% of the time over ssh or in a non-GUI VM/docker etc. I usually install emacs-nox to speed up the install. Vanilla emacs is fine. Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess. I do have one little elisp function that tries to find and open the header file for the C file I'm  currently in, or the c, cc, cpp, c++ file for the header file I'm in.

So even if you added some modification late at night/under influence of substances, you can still tell that you were thinking and easily switch it off or improve it.

So for instance, you might have: ~/.ssh/config.d/10-general.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/20-work.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/30-github.conf Can confirm this works great in teams or on multi-host setups, as it keeps things organized without cluttering a single massive config file and it works across tools like ssh, scp, rsync, etc. reply",

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

Understandably, some people complain that it shouldn't need a tutorial or the defaults are bad. There's validity to that angle. There's also validity to Emacs pre-dating GUIs, the IBM keyboard, and the x86 instruction set. Once you get past the history of windows and killing, you can explore. The history is also super interesting! https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?EmacsHistory https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386324 After you've read the tutorial, go wild. Try stuff out. Break things. Fix them. Learn your limits. Learn that there are very few limits imposed by Emacs itself. Hands down, the best resource for Emacs is Emacs itself. Especially, the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual. The \"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp\" is also excellent if you're not familiar with Lisp. Learn to read Info files and learn the help system (basically C-h f and C-h v) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ Emacs really is a flagship of Freedom, with all its pain and glory. It lets you exist at the threshold of your zone of proximal development. Every bit you put into Emacs, you get a return on investment. Welcome to the Emacs community! It's full of weirdos and wizards, as well as regular folk. Stick around and I'm sure you'll make friends in no time. reply",

          "text": "I sometimes still code with a local LLM but can't imagine doing it on a laptop. I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

          "text": "> gpt-oss-120b is amazing Yup, I agree, easily best local model you can run today on local hardware, especially when reasoning_effort is set to \"high\", but \"medium\" does very well too. I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline.

I couldnt find any good intro on the web-of-ads.  It's not much help with Zig, but then nothing seems to keep up with Zig at the moment. I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats? [edit] be sure to use it powered, linux is a bit battery heavy, but Qwen3 will pull 60W+ and flatten a battery real fast. reply",

Yes, the granite 4 models are on ollama: https://ollama.com/library/granite4 > but my interest is specifically in privacy respecting LLMs -- my goal is to run the most powerful one I can on my personal machine The HF Spaces demo for granite 4 nano does run on your local machine, using Transformers.js and ONNX. After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users. When I want to bundle up a little demo for something I typically just do that instead of the old way I did things (bundle it all up on a server and eat the inference cost). reply",

You are probably downloading one of these two ids: `granite4:small-h` or `granite4:32b-a9b-h`. The \"small\" model _is_ small in relative terms, but is also the largest of the currently released granite models! At 32B parameters (19GB download) it's runnable locally but not in the same \"run on your laptop with acceptable performance\" category of the nano/micro models. > Also my \"dev enviornment\" is vi -- I come from infosec (so basically a glorified sysadmin) so I'm mostly making little bash and python scripts, so I'm learning a lot of new things about software engineering as I explore this space :-) Shameless plug: if you're writing Python scripts to automate things using small locally hosted models, consider trying out https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea Mellea tries to nudge toward good software engineering practices -- breaking down big tasks into smaller parts, checking outputs after nondeterministic steps, thinking in terms of data structures and invariants rather than flow charts, etc. We built it with \"actual fully automated robust workflows\" in mind. You can use it with big models or small models, but it really shines when used with small models. reply",

On both i have setup lemonade-server on system start.\nAt work i use Qwen3 Coder 30B-3A with continue.dev. It serves me well in 90% of cases. At home i have 128GB RAM. I try a bit GPT120B. I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes. But i would like to allow parallel requests, so i need to tinker a bit more. Maybe llama-swap is enough. I just need to see how to deal with context length. My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM). Btw. even a AMD HX 370 with non soldered RAM can get some nice t/s for smaller models. \nCan be helpful enough when disconnected from internet and you dont know how to style a svg :) Thanks for opening up this topic!

I'm too dumb for Rust, Go's was close but lack of exceptions and classes made it not for me. Fpc hit the sweet spot. The syntax is a little clunky but I have classes when I need them, exception handling, memory management - both auto and manual and cross platform support.

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

That was not an FP invention, though. Delphi already did it - they kept the Apple's Object Pascal constructs from Turbo Pascal, and then bolted a whole new object system in parallel. FP inherited that mess and has to maintain it for backwards compatibility reasons. That said, given that the two systems are completely orthogonal, you can simply ignore the older one. The biggest thing going in favor of FP is that it has been around for almost 30 years now, so it's very mature. reply",

Most of the complexity involved comes from supporting a language in which data is expected to be both shared and mutable as a matter of course. I feel like we live in a world where everyone works very hard to pretend that C is our best low-level language, when in reality an APL-like purely functional array language would be a better candidate. reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

(After attempting to address the issue. But my experience is that toxics are gonna toxic. Don’t coddle them.) If you’re willing to lightly scorch some bridges, talk to your skip-level manager. If that doesn’t work, or you don’t want to, your best option is to go work for a decent manager, either at the same company or another one. Life’s too short, and you’re not going to be able to fix the toxic employee. In other words, get someone who can help, or get out. Take your friends with you. reply",

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

          "text": "Based on what you’ve written, you owe it to your skip to have this conversation with him. This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

          "text": "I talked to my manager just now. He knows of some cases where engineers have had bad experiences with him, but not others. Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand. It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. It's easy to say \"don't condescend to your teammates\". It's hard to say what behaviors that entails. reply",

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.).

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

But given you're in the leadership seat, it's worth taking a hard look\nat yourself asking how you're playing a role in this, especially since it's unlikely people are this difficult for no reason.

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant.

The manager might be totally wrong and the guy is getting worse and worse. This does not matter for my argument, which is that the manager puts his opinions above the one of the team lead. And he sees the team lead as part of the problem. Do you think there is an alternative explanation besides the manager not believing in the leadership qualities of OP? I am also not trusting what the problem guy says, except that OP calls him a competent jerk, which tells me that OP does not disagree that the problem guy is a capable engineer. >Where on earth is it even remotely implied that OP lets the engineers do what they want? I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities. Maybe they like him because he is a nice person or because his lack of leadership gets them something they want. reply",

We don’t know how the team reacted for a start - maybe they did back up OP. Or maybe, based on the alleged jerk’s aggressive behaviour to the team in the past, they felt scared to speak up. Or maybe they’re junior. Or maybe you’re right and all 9 people unanimously felt OP was in the wrong.

But having to go through your manager to force through a totally reasonable decision that is yours to make is being a bad leader. I do not think that there is any alternative interpretation then that this event at least is a failure in leadership. I am saying this because I want to tell OP how his situation sounds to a complete outsider. OP was there if the 9 guys all immediately stood up for him and told the other guy that he was clearly in the wrong, then this obviously disproves everything I said and OP knows that I am wrong.

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

          "text": "Sorry—I only speak Chinese, so I used translation software for my earlier messages. If there are mistakes, please feel free to point them out. I’m a game industry professional, and I’d like to share an unusual career journey. In 2019, China’s game industry was hit by license (banhao) restrictions—without a license, games couldn’t enter the market. Many studios shut down. Unfortunately, I was laid off in June with no severance. My boss was a founder; he treated people well, and none of us blamed him. After the layoff, my girlfriend and I often ate at a local barbecue shop. We got to know the owner, learned the ropes, and three months later—by October—we opened our own barbecue restaurant. Business started strong, but the good times didn’t last. In November, African swine fever broke out. For a barbecue shop that relied heavily on pork, it was a heavy blow: pork prices nearly tripled, other meats also became more expensive, and our customers were affected. Our daily revenue fell from around 6,000 to about 5,000. Soon after, something bigger hit—the pandemic. Right before the Lunar New Year, the government required all businesses to close for public health. We stayed home, but the storefront rent still had to be paid. Although the strict lockdown didn’t last long, the pandemic dragged on and the economy struggled. After a year of weak sales, my girlfriend and I agreed that I would return to the game industry. I found my current job, and she continued running the restaurant. In April 2021, my girlfriend and I broke up. I lost the energy to keep managing the restaurant, and by October we closed it so I could focus on my career. My first project at the new company—Nation of Darkness—spent two years in development and performed reasonably well at launch. We then began a second project just as the company was facing a cash crunch and needed results quickly. Unfortunately, our team lead didn’t deliver and was replaced. After the change, I felt increasingly out of sync with the new lead. About a year later, I left to team up again with my former lead, and together we started building the SeaGames platform. That’s my work experience—every move was one I actively pursued. If you notice any errors in my English, I’d really appreciate your feedback. reply",

But for my first job, I went through my friend list one by one and asked for jobs because 3 months on job sites weren't turning up anything. In the recent 5 years, LinkedIn has far surpassed FB for leads. Job boards are terrible. One rejected me while I was interviewing (got the interview via HN). One rejected me while I was in the office. Recruiters bring in a lot of high quality leads (highest being TikTok). But 0% success rate for me. One told me that I was ghosted for a role, but when I applied directly for that exact role later, I got it within 2 weeks of application. Sending out emails/DMs to C-levels and asking for a job actually has a good interview rate, but for startups. Most couldn't afford the usual rate, but if I were desperate, I'd do this. reply",

Don’t let your pride or frustrating keep you from exchanging labor for money to support your addiction to food and shelter. I don't know what to tell you other than the only different course of action was to kill myself and I didn't want to do that. Repeated trauma in multiple workplaces has effectively robbed me of my career. It's not all the fault of the employers I had, but it's also not 100% my fault either. I struggle with self worth because I cannot understand what my value is anymore. The experiences I have keep telling me I am worth less and less. People are less willing to hire me, to pay me, to even listen to what I have to say. Having all of this playing in your head 24/7 makes it impossible to view authority as anything but abusive and willfully ignorant. I know they aren't all like that... but then why does this keep happening to me? I want to go back but I don't know how. It's more than just someone being fussy there is something seriously psychologically wrong, but outwardly I \"look\" fine so I must be faking it / doing it for attention. I am tired of pandering to the people who refuse to see me. > What you described is neither hostile or toxic. I... didn't even describe the toxic work experiences I have had. The entire impetus to take the actions I did are not written in this post on purpose. I don't want to muddy the waters with conjecture and hearsay.

Leave your work at your job.  Neither your  employer nor your manager are  thinking about you when they leave work and they probably aren’t thinking about you too much while they are at work. If you got hit by a truck tomorrow, they will have an open req for your position before your body gets cold and you will only be briefly remembered if someone does a “git blame” on code you wrote. I was in a similar position from around 1999-2008 during my second job.  I was in a mutually destructive codependent cycle at work where they wouldn’t fire me because I was cheap labor and I wouldn’t quit because 5 years in I let my skills atrophy and I my personal life was in the shitter. Speaking of which, I was in a shitty marriage (divorced in 06 and remarried in 2012) that also affected my self worth and failing at a side real estate business.  My only saving grace then is I took up teaching fitness classes that I was good at. I said never again.  I stayed at that job another 2 years after my divorce, did the bare minimum while I got my head on straight, up skilled and got another job and from then on I treated my job as a throwaway commodity where I worked 40 hours a week, did the best I could and stayed in my lane and have money deposited into my account. That was my second job.  My 8th job was at the most toxic company in the industry - Amazon. Amazon put me “on focus”.  This is where they continuously escalate the requirements to get off focus and then they give you an official PIP. At that point you can either try to overcome the PIP or in my case get $40K severance.  But if you fail the PIP, you get 1/3 of the severance.  If you try to dispute it and fail you get 1/2 of the 1/3. I didn’t stress.  I knew how the game was played.  I did just enough to get my next vest of stocks, I went on vacation even though most people thought it was a bad idea and when the PIP or take severance conversation came, I didn’t even let them finish explaining what I had to do to get off PIP.  I asked them where do I sign to get my severance and how much it was. Then I took another vacation… My coworkers were stressed about having to go through the process and bewildered why I was so calm. Funny enough, I got a job quickly after being Amazoned and the same thing happened a year later - another layoff.  I did the same, I saw the writing on the wall within three months of starting.  I didn’t stress.  I didn’t cancel our vacation to Hawaii. My job doesn’t define me. reply",

          "text": "AGI is artificial general intelligence. It is defined in contrast to so-called \"narrow\" intelligence, which is AI systems limited to specific problem domains. This has always been a well-accepted definition, at least prior to the recent AI boom. In 2006 no one would have questioned this -- you can go find books and conference journals from this time that discuss AGI with this very specific definition. What happened was: over the 8 years between 2006 - 2014, a particularly vocal and organized group of fringe singletarians promoted the idea that once AGI is achieved (the originally well-defined conception of AGI), it will rapidly undergo recursive self-improvement and emerge as a singularly powerful entity with absolute power and control. The debate was whether this would happen in mere hours/days (fast takeoff) or months (slow takeoff). These nutcases would go on to take founding roles first at DeepMind, then OpenAI, and later Anthropic & other foundational labs. That they would achieve AGI and then neither of those outcomes come to pass was not in their range of predictions. Rather than admit to themselves that their analysis was wrong, they move goal posts: ChatGPT isn't real AGI. Real AGI would have taken over the world, so that can't be it. It is circular reasoning. No, it is real AGI. Real AGI didn't cause a singularity because intelligence actually doesn't matter as much as a bunch of autistic smart internet people think it does. reply",

Never visited the US, never had any plans to visit the US and don't have any relationships with anyone/anything from the West coast in the US, FWIW. I'm here because HN is filled with interesting people from all over the world, even encountered a childhood (programming) hero once or twice and managed to get questions answered. The wide range of people is why I keep coming back after almost two decades of being here. I mostly use https://news.ycombinator.com/active as a \"frontpage\", it's sorted by most active discussions rather than \"trending upvotes\", as I'm mainly here to read and write comments, rather than finding new articles. I think using any of the other \"lists\" as a frontpage might give you a different impression, because I certainly feel like HN is more \"Pro BigTech\" than any other websites, if anything I'd probably say the opposite, but probably the truth sits somewhere along the middle. reply",
