WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. We’re looking for senior software engineers to build our data platform and help us ingest and model messy, unstructured data into insights and actionable intelligence. At the heart of this is a 50m+ entity knowledge-graph with 200m+ relationships represented - and we need your help to build a system that can scale this up by an order of a magnitude. Today, we mostly use Python, Postgres, Airflow and Pyspark. If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you. Apply here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/wirescreen/89e08ab3-01ed-4296-9459-...

I've programmed in many languages and environments over the years. Some of my current interests are: • Aviation and geographic data. For example, airspace and obstacle data importers for Wing; election results and voter information maps for Google; many interactive maps for other companies. • Hardware interfacing. In a way, I am a \"full stack\" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest. • Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build. • Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code. I want to make sure it's the right code for what my users need, and that it's easy to maintain and improve as we learn more about what they want. Open to full time or contract. I look forward to talking with you! reply",

The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what.

While I do replace things all the time, I typically use multiple cursors (I do use bindings for that).

As far as keeping up with whats latest and greatest, I think the real answer is there isn't a good online resource. There are emacs meetups and conferences and some are virtual, and you can ask around other power users and see what they are doing. I even find emacs packages to be pretty poor at selling themselves on why you should use them.

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there. So I would not recommend those to new users, at least not if you would like to learn the basics and get a better hang of it, to be able to debug it, though some seem to be happy with those. reply",

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

Neither of the above is things I do more often than a handful of times a year. Meanwhile, terminal Emacs plays well with tmux and SSH which I do a lot of. For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box. I can steal this tmux session from any new connection. It also survives if the machine I'm sshing from dies or reboots. I can't think of a way to make it work with GUI emacs. reply",

Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess.

There's also validity to Emacs pre-dating GUIs, the IBM keyboard, and the x86 instruction set. Once you get past the history of windows and killing, you can explore. The history is also super interesting! https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?EmacsHistory https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386324 After you've read the tutorial, go wild. Try stuff out. Break things. Fix them. Learn your limits. Learn that there are very few limits imposed by Emacs itself. Hands down, the best resource for Emacs is Emacs itself. Especially, the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual. The \"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp\" is also excellent if you're not familiar with Lisp. Learn to read Info files and learn the help system (basically C-h f and C-h v) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ Emacs really is a flagship of Freedom, with all its pain and glory. It lets you exist at the threshold of your zone of proximal development. Every bit you put into Emacs, you get a return on investment. Welcome to the Emacs community! It's full of weirdos and wizards, as well as regular folk. Stick around and I'm sure you'll make friends in no time. reply",

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

          "text": "> gpt-oss-120b is amazing Yup, I agree, easily best local model you can run today on local hardware, especially when reasoning_effort is set to \"high\", but \"medium\" does very well too. I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

Same with the Mac mini, get the studio instead, it has a fan, the Mini does not. I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline. I do think Macs are phenomenal at running local LLMs if you get the right one. reply",

          "text": "Qwen3:32b on MBP M1 Pro 32GB running Asahi linux.  Mainly command line for some help with armv8 assembly, and some SoC stuff (this week explaining I2C protocol).  I couldnt find any good intro on the web-of-ads.  It's not much help with Zig, but then nothing seems to keep up with Zig at the moment. I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats? [edit] be sure to use it powered, linux is a bit battery heavy, but Qwen3 will pull 60W+ and flatten a battery real fast. reply",

After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users.

All the software is implemented by myself, but I started out with basically calling out to llama.cpp, as it was the simplest and fastest option that let me integrate it into my own software without requiring a GUI.

Desktop, Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB of RAM, RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM), performs very well and I can run most of the models I use daily all together, unless I want really large context then just GPT-OSS-120B + max context, ends up taking ~70GB of VRAM. > What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short). Almost anything and everything, but mostly coding. But then general questions, researching topics, troubleshooting issues with my local infrastructure, troubleshooting things happening in my other hobbies and a bunch of other stuff. As long as you give the local LLM access to a search tool (I use YaCy + my own adapter), local models works better for me than the hosted models, mainly because of the speed and I have better control over the inference. It does fall short on really complicated stuff. Right now I'm trying to do CUDA programming, creating a fused MoE kernel for inference in Rust, and it's a bit tricky as there are a lot of moving parts and I don't understand the subject 100%, and when you get to that point, it's a bit hit or miss. You really need to have a proper understanding of what you use the LLM for, otherwise it breaks down quickly. Divide and conquer as always helps a lot. reply",

On both i have setup lemonade-server on system start.\nAt work i use Qwen3 Coder 30B-3A with continue.dev. It serves me well in 90% of cases. At home i have 128GB RAM. I try a bit GPT120B. I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes. But i would like to allow parallel requests, so i need to tinker a bit more. Maybe llama-swap is enough. I just need to see how to deal with context length. My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM). Btw. even a AMD HX 370 with non soldered RAM can get some nice t/s for smaller models. \nCan be helpful enough when disconnected from internet and you dont know how to style a svg :) Thanks for opening up this topic!

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

That was not an FP invention, though. Delphi already did it - they kept the Apple's Object Pascal constructs from Turbo Pascal, and then bolted a whole new object system in parallel. FP inherited that mess and has to maintain it for backwards compatibility reasons. That said, given that the two systems are completely orthogonal, you can simply ignore the older one. The biggest thing going in favor of FP is that it has been around for almost 30 years now, so it's very mature. reply",

It had design decisions to evolve it more like newer languages (eg it has inbuilt async/await and did on .Net before C#, tuples, nullables etc) and sanitised the syntax somewhat. I like it a lot. https://www.remobjects.com/elements/oxygene/language reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me.

Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker.

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.). Curious as the advice rings sound, but I only saw your consultancy work. reply",

Three outcomes in order of likelihood: - they take the hint and leave - they improve enough to get the PIP off them - you have justification for disciplinary actions including termination.

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

I would if you are value to company and he is really being an outright asshole on this meeting be prepared to say \"look if you're not gonna genuinely cooperate as your lead I'll officially file a complaint/recommend to boot you from this team/whatever\" and leave.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

As far as I can tell, your only real course of action is to learn to live with him. I've worked with many people like this. Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.” - Marcus Aurelius, \"Meditations\" reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

But given you're in the leadership seat, it's worth taking a hard look\nat yourself asking how you're playing a role in this, especially since it's unlikely people are this difficult for no reason. I am rather a bit skeptical of this account as written. One hint: he was told he was meant to be the lead. That's a bit of a shitty promise to be given and taken away. This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem.

          "text": "I think there are four pieces of evidence: - One person on the team does not respect him. That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

Being correct and being willing to verbalize when you don’t know something or don’t know the ideal answer to a situation is the number one trick to establishing a reputation as a rockstar IMO. That may give you a lot of sway. Keep a great paper trail both on this guy and to cover your own ass. I would probably begin building a case to fire him, aka “managing him out”. I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits? As long as you document the shit out of everything he does wrong, your ass is covered. Best of luck, I can’t stand obnoxious people at work so I hope you can get him his comeuppance. reply",

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure.

In response to your final paragraph especially, it sounds like you need to have a real, frank conversation with someone who can help you navigate this situation. One in which you can get into the complex details of the situation and balance all your competing needs and desires. I say this because, sadly, you will not be able to solve this problem by running away from it, because it will find you again and you'll be even more tired and even less interested in dealing with it. You probably need more than \"Get out and take your people with you\". If you'd like to try to have this conversation, then I think I can help. You can start with my handle here, search the web, find out more about me (to judge for yourself whether I might be able to help you or I'm full of shit), and then contact me. If you think we might click, then ask me for help. Ignore anything that you see along the way that looks like a price. Meantime, any advice I can offer will sound like a platitude, so I won't bother. The reality of the situation is much more complex than that. Instead, think about what you'd like to have happen and maybe we can figure out how to make it happen. Peace. reply",

Or just use N8N :) I feel like there are a lot of tools in this space, but they're all flawed, or they all defeat the purpose of Clay - which is having easy access to a lot of integrations with external data providers, and then falling back to their AI agent if you can't find a data provider. You're probably not going to save money by spending more time stitching together multiple tools, instead of doing everything at once in Clay. That said, I did compiled some alternatives in my blog awhile ago if you're interested. (Just search for \"Bloomberry Clay alternatives\"). If you're OK with some limitations like less CRM integrations (ie. some only support Hubspot), or less data providers (some use less contact data providers in their waterfall enrichment), then there definitely are some cheaper ones you can try. Is there a particular thing you can live without? reply",

I'm not aware of anything with the JSONBin.io API (frankly I don't like their API, I think it should be more RESTful). CouchDB is in many ways very similar to JSONBin and self hostable. I have also written small services that use SQLite's JSON support and wrap that up in a fairly restful API (e.g. POST a document to a list adds an item, etc.). Another option is to use something like PostgREST, which I get isn't at all what you asked, but in this day and age you can just ask ChatGPT to make you a schema and it takes 2 minutes to prototype a REST API. Really it depends if you have preferences for what datastore you use, as that is the more difficult bit when self hosting. reply",

It's so overwhelmingly dominant that it eclipses almost every other platform put together, with some exceptions for consoles and mobile. Even when it's targeted at these, Steam is such a powerful marketing/discovery channel for games. When Steam says no AI, nobody does AI. It's not just no AI generated content, some argue it means no brainstorming dialogue via AI and so on. The game dev community selects for this. This means that alternative platforms like Itch tend to also lean towards anti-AI even if they could differentiate by allowing AI. Consoles tend to also build for PC and adopting AI would cost them too much. Pro-AI people tend to move to other platforms like Play Store and App Store, and lately we're seeing more quality control ramp up on these. reply",

Did Chrome change? Seems overall the same to me. Did Firefox change, might depend on whom you ask.

If your problem is die early, then it loses information an assert() would preserve. If your problem is a dislike of if-elif-elif- then I think you argue more for a case: statement than a GOTO.

One methodology I've seen used with installed apps is major upgrades require a financial renewal but those can be spaced out every couple years. I love it when I find an iOS app that is paid, without ads, without in-app purchases. You just need to plan how that business model works and know that you won't have recurring revenue. Maybe that means you build companion apps, offer an optional subscription tier (often its cloud storage/device sharing based) or something like that. I've thought of doing a subscription like service but its use case is more of a once-in-a-while style so an option there would be pay-per use instead of a subscription. reply",

However the business is as it is For software I really like the patreon model (like in some game communities) monthly subscription you could cancel after downloading and if you want updates you just get another month. Big portion will just pay monthly while they wait anyway. Best for all worlds. Otherwise I would maybe recommend a yearly price instead of monthly. Especially if the monthly would be something small anyway. Easy to forget so most people will at least pay 2 years and you save a lot in transaction costs. reply",

          "text": "On the contrary. Subscription-based pricing model is dying, and fast. People are tired of it. Just look up articles about how SaaS are slowly disappearing and how entrepreneurs should avoid creating SaaS if possible. People usually prefer one-time payments over monthly payments. There are exceptions, usually when the program/service is very valuable and expensive, it makes more sense to just pay for what you use, but in general single payment will always win. Also it depends whether we're talking local or remote service as remote service has inherent cost and having a single payment is not compatible with it. Additionally, there is a distinction between single and ongoing payment in the context of usability. Specifically, it makes little sense to sell a calculator program via a subscription fee but you also reach a limit of the possible customer base. Just like mobile applications. With subscription, you can keep milking the same customer for money indefinitely, but in such case you have to keep providing some services that is worth the payment. reply",

          "text": "In the beginning we sold a product for a one-time fee. Every couple of years we'd release a (paid for) upgrade. The market was young, new features were obvious. The company was funded by \"new sales\". Development, support, admin etc was all funded by sales. As our customers grew, so our costs grew. Support goes up, so fine, we'll offer support contracts. But users typically don't sign up for these (but call support anyway and get pissed if we blow them off, or bill them.) We make \"updates\" and sell those. But to do that we must \"add features\" (customers expect all bug fixes to be free forever). Adding features which offer true value becomes harder. Upgrade sales drop off, but now we have lots of different versions in the field. Obviously sales plateaus at some point. The list of people receiving value goes up, the potential market gets smaller. In short, the source of revenue and the receivers of value are disconnected. This is not sustainable. You are one or two bad sales months from closing up shop. The optimal strategy for this business model is to find the sales peak, terminate all support, and accumulate as much from residual sales as possible. We switched to a subscription model. Now those receiving value (updates, fixes, support, training, features etc) pay a known amount at a known time. We can budget, they can budget. If sales disappear current development and support can continue. (Aka Covid). Income and expenses are aligned. We sell to business not consumers. While consumers might not like subscriptions, businesses love them. They allow for much simpler procurement (no sudden support or upgrade bills), assurance of longevity, reduced capital costs upfront. We can grow headcount based on known income. We can grow sustainably without requiring sales to match. Subscriptions work because the match income to expenses. Those who receive value pay for it in a sustainable way. It's as simple as that. reply",

          "text": "Is it a “bug” when Apple releases a new OS/phone that either breaks backwards compatibility or does something like release the iPhone 5 and changes the form factor making your app look janky?  This was when Apple released frameworks to allow phones of different sizes around 2012? Or more recently should users expect a free upgrade when Apple deprecated 32 bit apps? The Mac sees a lot less churn than iOS.  But things do happen that cause apps not to work there.  The most recent is that Electron was using a private API and all apps that used that version of Electron on Macs broke. reply",
