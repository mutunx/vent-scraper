          "text": "An interview is a sales pitch for a product. The product just happens to be you. Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

I once had a candidate say something like “yeah and that job didn’t end very nicely…I’ll just leave it at that.” This is not a good thing to say in a job interview. 3.

          "text": "Why are you leaving your current job questions are typically inartful checks whether there's \"something wrong with you.\" Refusing to meaningfully answer can come across as, \"I'd prefer not to discuss whether there's something wrong with me.\" Not explicitly damaging, but certainly not confidence building. The most useful answers I've heard in the wild were dispassionate, one sentence expressions of why <objective fact> made the existing job irreconcilable with your <valid need>. Done well, that shows the hiring manager you're able to approach conflict constructively, and gives reason to believe the bad fit is unlikely to recur in this role. AskAManager[0] also suggests \"I’m not actively looking, but I saw this job and was really interested because of X,\" as a reasonably broad spectrum solution to this problem. (Though after just a year, I as a hiring manager might still worry you are flighty). [0] https://www.askamanager.org/2023/02/how-do-i-tell-interviewe... reply",

          "text": "In an interview setting you should frame negatives as growth. You are doing marketing, not a retrospective or post mortem so put on the LinkedIn-style, vacuously-half-a-person mask. The interviewers know their job isn't perfect so a valuable thing to evaluate is \"can this person keep a positive and effective attitude through both good and bad\". Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest.

We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

          "text": "I have learnt after trying various levels of honesties in interviews that you just don't talk about \"negative\" things as negative things, you talk about negative things disguised/spun as positive things, however much it may disgust you. This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\". [1] Heaven forbid, if you tell them \"you regret not standing up to that manager and not fighting and making a stink\" :) reply",

I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job. Oh and the third - keep an up to date resume, a constantly updated longer form career document that lists out your major accomplishments in STAR format, an up to date skillset, and a solid network. reply",

Just typical average normal shit that every fucking normal semi-competent person does when applying for a job. What you want to do is publicly shit on your previous employer and still get another job. That's not too smart, now is it? Every company that's looking for people to hire can see exactly how you're going to treat that company once you've moved on and no longer work there. Everybody has issues with their previous job. The way you deal with it is you discuss those issues with your self-help group at the local bar. When you're in an interview, every single thing in your work history was great. The people that you worked with were great. The companies that you worked with were great. Everything was fucking excellent. Just totally fucking excellent. Brilliant. When people hear, \"It's a period of my life where I was mostly unhappy\", that's a guy they don't want to go to work every day and work with. At least I don't. I got my own problems. I fucking want to retire tomorrow at the latest. I don't fucking want to go in to work tomorrow. I really don't. I might call in sick. Easter Bird Flu or some completely made up shit. You think that's what I tell them? I tell them everything is going great. Everything is fucking excellent. I'm probably going to work tomorrow. reply",

          "text": "Part of the reason bit torrent works really well is that the file is downloaded in random order. It lets everyone cooperate, while still being robust to bad peers, bad network connections, churn etc. If you want live high quality streaming, a lot of reasons bit torrent works so well goes away. Latency matters. In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. In bit torrent, everyone can divide the work - clients try to download the part of the file the least number of people have, quickly rare parts of the file spread everywhere. In streaming everyone needs the same piece at the same time. Bit torrent punishes people who dont contribute by deprioritizing sending stuff to peers that freeride. It can do this on the individual level. In a p2p streaming setup, you probably have some peers getting the feed, and then sending it to other peers. The relationship isnt reciperocal so its harder to punish freeriders as you can't at the local level know if the peer you are sending data to is pushing data to the other nodes it is supposed to or not. I'm sure some of these have work arounds, but they are hard problems that aren't really satisfactorily solved reply",

In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. First of all, BitTorrent clients do not download in random order or wait 5 minutes. They usually download the rarest block first, but can do whatever they want, whenever they want. Second, standard HLS sets a nominal segment size of 6 seconds (some implementations will go as high as 10 seconds), and a client will usually cache multiple segments before playing (e.g., 3). This mean that you have 18 seconds before a segment becomes critical. This is not a difficult thing for a P2P network to handle. You'd adapt things to introduce timing information and manage number of hops, but each client can maintain a connection to a number of other clients and have sufficient capacity to fill a segment if a connection fails. Various strategies could be used to distribute load while avoiding latency penalties. Low-latency HLS uses much smaller segments and would be more demanding, but isn't impossible to manage. > BitTorrent punishes people who dont contribute Private communities punish this behavior, BitTorrent clients do not. Most new downloads will appear as freeriders for a long time, and only over long periods far exceeding the download time will enough compatible seeding opportunities arise for them to contribute in any substantial way. The network does not need everyone to seed, it only needs enough people to seed. reply",

The only way to be a seed these days is to get the release microseconds after it gets released, and download it before everyone else gets their hands on it, so you can upload to them. Everyone else then has to download from you, but since everyone that's more than slightly involved has a seedbox with symmetric gigabit, the issue of leeches just isn't the same as it was before in the dial up and DSL era. That the culture hasn't been able to evolve past that, and hangs on to such outdated notions is disappointing. I'm not saying people shouldn't be incentivized to give back. Leeches suck. But in this land of plenty, theres this problem of being unable to seed because there's just too many seeders trying to seed. reply",

The server can control the stream by advertising a customized manifest to individual clients, although it's a bit silly. HLS is designed to be extremely easy to load distribute and throw CDN/cache proxies in front, and it's a bad sad that content providers are this bad at load management. :/ Either way, the assumption here is that you would swap out the client doing HLS with a client designed to use a P2P protocol, including the seeding portion and network health management. reply",

Most of what you are saying isn't accurate for netflix style streaming, which would actually be more aptly called \"video on demand\", but is very applicable to \"live streaming\" in the sense of live sporting events or news broadcasts. Video-on-demand is perfectly implementable on top of BitTorrent. As you say, there are some latency pitfalls you'll have to avoid, but that's nothing you can't hack yourself out of. Livestreaming is a different beast. As you say, the problem with livestreaming is that everyone needs the same content at the same time. If I spend 200ms downloading the next 500ms worth of content, then there's nobody to share it with, they all spent the 200ms doing the same. BitTorrent relies on the time shift that is allowed between me downloading the content and you requesting it. If you request it before I've got it, well I can't fulfil that request, only the guy I intend to get it from can. If you wanted to implement something like that, you would probably pick a tree of seeders where the protocol would pick a subset of trusted nodes that it would upload the content to before then allowing them to seed it, and the have them doing the same recursively. That would obviously introduce a bunch of complexity and latency, and would very much not be BitTorrent anymore. reply",

For example, say you have a cluster of people on the call in the US and another cluster in the UK. Ping times are 100ms or more across the ocean, there will be some random packets lost, but ping times within the UK are around 15ms max. By working co-operatively and sharing among themselves the clients in one cluster can fill in missing packets from a different cluster far quicker than the requesting them from the originating host. In general, the ability to request missing packets from a more local source should be able to improve overall video call quality. It still might be \"too late\", because for minimal latency, you might choose to use packets as soon as they arrive and maybe even treat out-of-order packets as missing, and just display a blockier video instead, but if the clients can tolerate a little more latency (maybe a tunable setting, like 50ms more than the best case) then it should in theory work better than current systems. I've been mulling over some of these ideas myself in the past, but it's never been high enough on my TODO list to try anything out. reply",

That's only true if you assume the nodes operate sequentially, which is not given. If the nodes operate independently from one another (which they would, being non-cooperating) they'd all get a response in ~100ms (computation and signaling time is negligible here), which is faster than they could get it cooperatively, even if we assume perfect cooperation (100ms for the first local node + 15ms from there). It's parallelism. Doing less work might seem theoretically nice, but if you have the capacity to do the same work twice simultaneously you avoid the synchronization. Basically, it falls somewhere in my loose \"tree based system\" sketch. In this case the \"trusted\" nodes would be picked based on ping time clustering, but the basic sketch that you pick a subset of nodes to be your local nodes and then let that structure recursively play out is the same. The problem you run into is latency. There's no good way to pick a global latency figure for the whole network, since it varies by how deep into the tree you are. As the tree grows deeper, you end up having to retune the delay. The only other option is to grow in width at which point you've just created a another linear growth problem, albeit with a lower slope. reply",

You should understand my argument more as a sketch of proof. That being said I have a small correction. If you want to stream to two peers (that is you have a network with 3 fully connected nodes, one being the originator of the stream) and the link latency for all links is 20ms, then your lowest latency path to each node is exactly 20ms, as the originating node could simply send the content to each client. The unfortunate realization is that 20ms is then also the optimal stream delay, assuming you care about the shortest possible latency for your live streaming service. The clients will therefore end up with the content exactly when they were supposed to show it, and therefore they would have no time to forward it to anyone else, lest that downstream would get the content AFTER they were supposed to show it. reply",

          "text": "For a while, I was CTO of a company called Livestation [0], which as the Wikipedia article states, was \"originally based on peer-to-peer technology acquired from Microsoft Research\". This P2P stack was meant to allow for mass scaling of lowish latency video streaming, even in parts of the World with limited peer bandwidth to original content source servers. The VC-1 format got into a legal quagmire, as most video streaming protocols do, and it speaks volumes that by the time I turned up in ~2012-ish, the entire stack was RTMP, RTSP, HDS and HLS with zero evidence of that P2P tech stack in production. My main role was to get the ingest stack out of a DC and into cloud, while also dealing with a myriad of poor design decisions that led to issues (yes, that 2013 outage in the first paragraph of the wiki article was on my watch). At no point did anybody suggest to me that what we really needed to fix our attention back to was P2P streaming, beyond the fact the company built a version of Periscope (Twitter's first live streaming product), and launched it weeks/months before they did, and were pivoting towards a social media platform, at which point I decided to go do other things. The technical and legal problems are real, and covered elsewhere here. People want reliable delivery. Even Spotify, YouTube and others who have licensed content and could save a pile by moving to DRM-ified P2P don't go near it, and that should tell you something about the challenges. I'd love more widespread adoption of P2P tech, but not convinced we'll ever see it in AV any time soon, unfortunately. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveStation reply",

For 'hobbyists' there is a lot of complexity with setting up your own streaming infrastructure compared to just using YouTube or Twitch. Then for media companies who want to own it, they can just buy their own infra and networking which is outrageously cheap. HE.net advertises 40gbit/sec of transit for $2200/month. I'm oversimplifying this somewhat, you do have issues with cheap transit and probably need backups especially for certain regions. But there isn't much of a middleground between hobbyists and big media cos. For piracy (live sports streams), I've read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Stream being used for this exact purposes FWIW.

It is totally possible to do with BitTorrent and request the blocks in the order that you want but you may not always be able to get them in the order you want. In general people aren't tolerant of lag and spinning circles and other such things when they're trying to watch streaming content. If you're fine with just watching it a little bit later might as well queue it up and left the whole thing down load so it's ready when you're ready. reply",

I think you would probably need something more in the neighbourhood of 10 minutes to really make a difference. If you could make a stable p2p live streaming app with the number of peers all watching the same stream in the hundreds and only 30 seconds latency, i'd consider that pretty amazing. > Also do you think there's any way you can prioritize seeders in such a protocol? like some kind of algorithm that the more you share the more you're prioritized in getting the most up to date packets. If we are talking about a livestream (and not \"netflix\" type streaming) then i don't think seeders are a thing. You can't seed a file that isn't finished being created yet. If you mean more generally punishing free-riders, i think  that is difficult in a live stream as generally data would be coming in from a different set of peers than the peers you are sending data out to, so its difficult (maybe not impossible) to know who is misbehaving. reply",

People with depression will tell you it is 100% depression, while people with anxiety will tell you it is 100% anxiety, and people with burnout will tell you it is 100% burnout. Other people will tell you to go outside, or to eat low carb, or to lift weights. Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

          "text": "Aside from any diagnoses or assessing burnout, I’d suggest thinking about what is actually causing the lack of motivation when you sit down. Working on a business is different from coding, per se. You might lack motivation to work on your business specifically or to generally be figuring out business problems. All coding is not equal — are you coding bug fixes, new features, solutions architecture? These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover.

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! To be clear I'm not resentful and don't have negative feelings towards coding or programming, it's just that it's not worth sacrificing much more than anything else for. If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

          "text": "Behavior change at a group level is often driven by sociological forces that start small and build up over time. I highly recommend the work of Damon Centola. His books “Change: How to Make Big Things Happen” and “How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions” are full of stories that help illustrate the concepts he studies. He’s a legit sociologist whose research points to the value of strong ties to help drive persistent adoption and behavior change (whether societal or in product adoption, it’s all based on the same principles). I would not recommend the works by Jonah Berger that also deal with the same topic, because they are primarily based on marketing observations that are often shallow and misleading. For example, the misinterpretation of the “influencer” phenomenon, whereby he concludes that people who gain a following and become popular online actually help shape behavior. That is often, as we now know, only a fleeting phenomenon more akin to a lottery than anything that drives actual change. When you really study the ways in which big products like say, Twitter, blew up, you see that they started with a small group of people who loved them. By the time the “influencers” picked up, the product already had a dedicated audience that made it feel “safe” for the popular person to promote them. Anyway, I hope you enjoy Centola’s work if you check it out. And good luck! reply",

You have a history of conversations and it was easy to CC the boss if someone didn't cooperate. People no longer spent the whole day replying emails. Or Amazon. Instead of selling everything online, they started with books. Books were annoying to buy and easy to \"ship\". A modern example might be Cursor. People already use VSC. They kept the exact same interface, added a few extra features, and end up selling agents. There's lots of agents out there which are great like Aider, but many are too far from someone's workflow. Most of these are in the form of \"create a channel people use, then sell things down that channel\". reply",

          "text": "As I describe before here https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/heres-how-you-can-stay-ahe... , many roboticists overlook the need for JavaScript in their skill set and tech stack. This is because of the evolution of robotics projects and companies: first you build a prototype and only then do you deploy and scale your fleet. The first part is hard and doesn't require any JS. But the second part is even harder and requires a ton of JS, because without web-tooling you won't be able to operate efficiently. This offers a great opportunity for roboticists to distinguish themselves from others be mastering JS for both the backend (rosnodejs, rclnodejs) and the front-end (React, Transitive Robotics). This sets you apart from both \"regular\" roboticists and from \"pure\" web developers. What I'm trying to say: robotics is a very broad field and your current full-stack skills are needed just as well. And while working on those aspects of the robotics stack you can learn about the rest if you want. But you don't even have to to progress in your career in the robotics industry. If you want to work on something specific, you can try to build a capability (\"full-stack app\") on Transitive, the open-source full-stack framework for robotics we've built that works with any robots, esp. ROS ones: https://github.com/transitiverobotics/transitive . Oh and of course learn ROS along the way. reply",

I think LLM agents might just be the little advantage they need, like guided missiles with GPS. Evolutionary programming is hard though.

When GoDaddy wanted to enter the market, they bought Starfield who already had a root which was widely trusted and crossed that with their own.

If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it. Some possible ideas: Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity. Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense. Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc). Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad. You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough reply",

          "text": "Yeah, never open source your code. There are no benefits to it. I speak from experience. 1. Unless you have business connections and raised funding from people who do, open source wil not help gain any additional adoption or raise awareness of your project. This only worked in the past. 2. Hardly anybody who does happen to use your open source project will pay you. You need massive global exposure just to make a developers' standard salary... I remember for years Evan You who built VueJS was getting like $120k max in sponsorships annually (I think it was Patreon), at the peak... And VueJS was extremely popular at the time and being updated frequently... And companies got something (e.g. exposure) in exchange for the sponsorship. 3. It doesn't matter how good it is. Implementation details don't really matter. If your product is useful, some big tech company will build an inferior alternative but promote it like crazy. Nobody will even know your project exists. It doesn't matter if your product is better for many use cases; people won't know it exists so that fact is irrelevant. 4. At best, some big tech monopoly will use your open source code to train their AI to replace you in the marketplace or drive down your wages. People like Linus, DHH, Matt Mullenweg, Solomon Hykes... Who made millions; are from a different epoch and different place too. Not happening anymore. Don't be fooled. They all had to move to Silicon Valley at some point. It's a big club and you ain't in it. My advice is; if you can't sell it, keep your code and use for yourself and your friends/family. reply",

Okay...so it isn't \"sustainable\". So you stop maintaining it. So what? You made a neat thing. You had fun making it. You shared it with others because you thought it was neat, and maybe someone else found it useful too. That's the happy ending of a happy story.

If OP wants to keep the code to themselves then go ahead, your IP nobody cares. If OP wants to build an actual project to monetize the code that way then go for it.

You spend some time and energy to grow some delicious fruits and vegetables that you and your family enjoy eating. You have extra so you share some with friends and neighbors. You still have way more than you need and you don't want it to go to waste. You contemplate opening a stand to sell to passersby. That's a lot of work so you just put out a box with a sign for anyone to take what they want for free. Some drop by and get what they need and you get an occasional 'thank you' note. Someone leaves a few bucks in a jar for you. It makes you feel good. But not everyone is so well behaved. Kids come by and tip over the box or throw some peaches at your house. Some criticize you that some of your free stuff is not the best quality and demand better service. Then you find out the local grocer is stopping by every day to take it all and sell it in his store. What started out as a good will gesture, turns into a headache. Of course the analogy falls apart a bit when you compare a tangible good like food to easily replicatable digital bits, but it still fits in some ways. reply",

I was proud to contribute even if I didn't capture much of the value I created... Now I feel like all of this structure is exploiting and manipulating me and others psychologically. The level of ethics is so low, it is beyond what I could have imagined. I simply don't get the same feelings as I once did. Working on open source doesn't make me hopeful and feel like part of something, it makes me feel like a naive fool. My comments may sound negative but I'm trying to help others, who may be slightly younger versions of myself, to avoid a lot of pain. This pain doesn't teach you much besides resilience and the gains there become extremely marginal... On the other hand, it doesn't seem very useful career-wise to see things as they are. To succeed, you need to be on the same wavelength of optimism as existing successful people. My worldview is holding me back. Ignorance can be an advantage. reply",

The rest is in debugging the code for all the edge cases, writing docs, examples, training, support etc. In other words the \"work\" part. Minimally you need to do enough so that someone can use the code. The code itself has minimal value, the value is in the using. Then you need to figure out how to reach an audience. Then you need to decide if the user will pay, or maybe it's ad supported. Or maybe donations. Hint: unless you have a large audience this will result in very minimal income. Is all this extra work worth it? You can Open Source it, but frankly its unlikely anyone will find it or use it. It might be an interesting line on your CV, bit again probably of marginal value there. My advice is that if it has little to no value to others, just move on. reply",

However, FOSS, as applied to apps, games & tools is nothing more than tech slavery, which is why nowadays it's championed by FANNG and the Deep State (some countries like Israel and India commercialize FOSS source codes as a matter of statecraft).

          "text": "An interview is a sales pitch for a product. The product just happens to be you. Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

You can use the technique of \"mental reservation\". There is always something positive or complimentary that can be said about every bad situation, every horrible supervisor. It is simply a matter for you to examine it dispassionately, extract the good, and frame that nicely without introducing insults or the real negativity and pain that you felt in the moment. If your supervisor overworked you and you were induced to come in for 70-hour weeks and you ultimately burned out with no vacation or weekends, you could say that the management \"was quite dedicated to the company's goals and productivity\". If you considered your coworkers to be slackers and they never seemed to work, \"the company accommodated a wide range of talents, skills and abilities.\" If you never saw your supervisor and had nearly no guidance on projects or tasks, \"the management believed in me and trusted me to do the right thing in nearly every respect.\" These are not lies and you should not lie, because if you go counterfactual, that will be found out. If, on the other hand, they know you had a difficult time and you still found ways to compliment those bastards, then perhaps you will do the same favor for them one day. reply",

Although there is plenty of truth that there's an unfair bias against negativity, I do think there's a very valid reason for hiring managers to care about whether or not an applicant can remain positive or at least objectively neutral in an interview, and be diplomatic about negative experiences. Invariably, at any company, even if they are a fantastic workplace, you are going to disagree with your lead or coworkers at some point. You will be asked to do work you aren't excited about or don't see value in, and you will be asked to work with people you don't particularly like. If you aren't able to maintain a fairly positive attitude for a one hour interview, it makes sense that a hiring manager might worry about how well you'll be able to be a team player when things get rough. I used to think it was bullshit, and I learned the hard way. I hired someone who was fairly unpleasant during his interview, because he was the most competent applicant, and it seemed wrong to me to look at anything other than job skills. He was an excellent programmer, but he sucked so much time and energy out from the rest of the team with complaints and arguments. Of course I don't think that's always going to be the case, sometimes people have gone through genuinely negative past work experiences or just have brusque personalities, but I was certainly wary after that of people who couldn't put on a positive attitude for an interview. reply",

You are doing marketing, not a retrospective or post mortem so put on the LinkedIn-style, vacuously-half-a-person mask. The interviewers know their job isn't perfect so a valuable thing to evaluate is \"can this person keep a positive and effective attitude through both good and bad\". Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

My background in academia colors me but the level of office politics some describe in the private sector genuinely sounds like a middle school drama club at times. I've personally witnessed incredibly talented individuals at FAANG companies get the boot for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with their competence. Think messy personal dynamics, bosses having affairs with coworkers aiming for a position. It makes me wonder about this ingrained necessity for pretense and obfuscation in private sector communication. Why the need to constantly play these games as if acknowledging reality is somehow detrimental? In academia, while not devoid of its own issues, the selection process for students at least attempts to prioritize merit and potential. The idea that some of the most brilliant minds I've encountered might be filtered out by arbitrary corporate \"standards,\" while incapable but politically savvy individuals thrive, seems counterproductive. reply",

Let’s take your example - boss has an affair with a coworker, you speak up about it, then you get the boot and sign an NDA. In that scenario, I’d probably say something like the following: “There was an interpersonal incident that was out of my control, and unfortunately I’m not legally allowed to speak about it in detail. What I can say is that I learned how important it is to stand up for what’s right even if it comes at a personal cost.” This isn’t playing a game, it’s having empathy for the person sitting across the table from you. They have to make a decision on very limited information, and you’re trying to help them make that decision.

We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure how you would handle your specific situation, but my general take on interviews is that the interviewer isn't just screening you, in the sense that they want to know what you did and your skillset and skill level, they're also trying to figure out how well you can navigate interpersonal politics. And the problem is that for a lot of people those two things seem contradictory, because with interpersonal politics we'll intentionally spin things just slightly, not like a politician but just to maintain a good vibe and keep everyone comfortable and engaged. Like imagine if you were in a social gathering, and there's also a girl you like in there that you're trying to impress, and someone asked you about that previous role, you wouldn't drift off into a rant or anything negative because you don't want to kill the vibes of the meeting, you want to look your best because there's a girl you like there, so maybe you'd say something like \"ah, it just wasn't a good fit\". And if that came up while you were dating that girl you like, and she wanted to dig deeper on it, you wouldn't just repeat the same thing, because it would look like you're being evasive and she would then be on the defensive because she would've felt like she's prying too much, and it would kill the vibe, you'd just say something a little bit more, also keeping it short, and maybe mention something good about working there that you learned, and then not forcefully but try to make some room to move to another subject, or if you can do it slickly without making it feel awkward then you just shift to some other topic that feels engaging without making it look evasive. Again, it's all about maintaining a good vibe. And companies want to know the ins and outs about you, but they also just want to know that you have some social skills in doing stuff like that, because they're running a company with different kinds of people, sometimes from very different backgrounds, and they need the team to work together and feel cohesive. The company and the management are already trying to keep the company afloat and profitable, it's own engineering problem, on top of marketing, on top of operational concerns, they don't want to have concerns around political drama in the office, they want to know that you can be cool. Unless you're a boy genius from Southie, then maybe they'll tolerate a lot of weird shit from you, but you aren't a boy genius from Southie. reply",

I also talked about a security breach that defaced our website, but put it in the context of the overall success of our security practice. In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest. After all, it's our perceptions and our attitudes that we can change. An interview is not the place to unload your negative feelings.

That’s the time to be more honest about unrealistic deadlines. But even then I’m going to ask a follow up question about what did you do to try to influence change.

I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job.

My advice: - write down the stories (use cases) before the actual IV\n  - for each story, focus on what you learnt / succeeded\n  - for the really negative ones, focus on the learning\n  - for the other ones, focus on the outcomes, mentioning  things that worked and maybe some things that did not work  and how you did it This is the part where you have to act the game and avoid being too transparent. Mentioning too much the negative will be seen as a red flag by most hiring managers or recruiters. reply",

My story was that I loved the work and feel a great reward from delivering great products/outcomes, but we got pulled into a bad cycle of poor time management that compromised the work. You’re here to deliver excellence. It’s not about blame, it about finding a place to win. If you can deliver a narrative like that which doesn’t sound bitchy, it’s really powerful. reply",

This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\".

You don't know which of your interviewers did which, but you can assume that everyone has done something they knew was a bad idea. It's also reasonable to assume that an applicant is leaving for reasons. Bored? Wants more money? That's a pretty bad reason. Unhappy? That's a much better reason. What's the catch?

There isn't much recent news on it: https://aphyr.com/posts/285-jepsen-riak is from 2013 and Aphyr hasn't written about it in years. Armchair suspicion since we haven't heard about it in years is that it's pretty much end-of-life, deployed in a few legacy sites.

We got rid of it, because it was WAY oversized for our needs, it requires at least 3 servers to get benefits of architecture and querying data was slow in practice and very unwieldy at start, because you needed to essentially write your own \"sharding\" and paging support for queries. It was essentially big dumping ground for data, that you might read less than write. We tried it at start because it sounded cool to us too. We replaced it with postgres+timescale on one average server. Now after main contributing company folded, Riak is pretty much dead.

But get that software out in the field, grow its userbase, run it for years, and you have thousands if not millions of different uses of it. Take all the bugs that come out of that, fix them, and you have software that is less buggy. So sure, inexperienced teams put out bugs. I do, too... more than I should. Hopefully the egregious one's where it simply does not work never get to production. But the more nuanced bugs and their eventual fixes come from the software running in the wild.

Releasing software was expensive, you had to put it on physical media and ship it. QA was critical role, it was way less expensive to test the hell out it and fix it than it was to ship new code. The idea that computers could be trusted to perform tasks well was easily shattered when things went wrong, and the additional optics of losing customer trust went a long way into driving QA. Fast forward to today, and it's way cheaper to ship code with bugs to prove out an idea works than it is to spend even a few minutes writing test cases and doing even a modicum of QA. Ultimately, it's a not just a combination of all 3 things you've mentioned, which are all contributing factors; the real problem is any level of QA before proving an idea is seen as a waste of time and money. As someone who started in tech support & QA 30 years ago, it's really tough to see. reply",

(It won’t recognise the OS as supported and just refuses to do anything.) It has been reported, but nobody cares. I was told by support that this is a “will not fix” because it’s not a requirement. There is no way anything this catastrophically bad would have made it past QA back when Microsoft used to have an actual QA team. I swear there is a significant portion of development teams out there that are secretly pleased as punch that they can just push whatever garbage they want straight to production without the pesky people in QA “just complaining” and being “obstructionist”. reply",

Create a bootstrapping function that modifies a prototype or class in order to provide functions to register signals and slots and use them wherever you need them.

Other people will tell you to go outside, or to eat low carb, or to lift weights. Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover. Best of luck! reply",

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

          "text": "First, read this about focus: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715347 Now, it’s only a matter of what you want. When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

Changing behaviour of people, en masse is actually kind of difficult.

          "text": "Behavior change at a group level is often driven by sociological forces that start small and build up over time. I highly recommend the work of Damon Centola. His books “Change: How to Make Big Things Happen” and “How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions” are full of stories that help illustrate the concepts he studies. He’s a legit sociologist whose research points to the value of strong ties to help drive persistent adoption and behavior change (whether societal or in product adoption, it’s all based on the same principles). I would not recommend the works by Jonah Berger that also deal with the same topic, because they are primarily based on marketing observations that are often shallow and misleading. For example, the misinterpretation of the “influencer” phenomenon, whereby he concludes that people who gain a following and become popular online actually help shape behavior. That is often, as we now know, only a fleeting phenomenon more akin to a lottery than anything that drives actual change. When you really study the ways in which big products like say, Twitter, blew up, you see that they started with a small group of people who loved them. By the time the “influencers” picked up, the product already had a dedicated audience that made it feel “safe” for the popular person to promote them. Anyway, I hope you enjoy Centola’s work if you check it out. And good luck! reply",

It can be hormonal or chemical. You might get a few people to change a habit - but you've got no chance with the others. You might get one person to change, but if your product requires a group, ie social behavior, you've got no chance. It's good that you recognize that behavior needs to change.

Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

Although there is plenty of truth that there's an unfair bias against negativity, I do think there's a very valid reason for hiring managers to care about whether or not an applicant can remain positive or at least objectively neutral in an interview, and be diplomatic about negative experiences. Invariably, at any company, even if they are a fantastic workplace, you are going to disagree with your lead or coworkers at some point. You will be asked to do work you aren't excited about or don't see value in, and you will be asked to work with people you don't particularly like. If you aren't able to maintain a fairly positive attitude for a one hour interview, it makes sense that a hiring manager might worry about how well you'll be able to be a team player when things get rough. I used to think it was bullshit, and I learned the hard way. I hired someone who was fairly unpleasant during his interview, because he was the most competent applicant, and it seemed wrong to me to look at anything other than job skills. He was an excellent programmer, but he sucked so much time and energy out from the rest of the team with complaints and arguments. Of course I don't think that's always going to be the case, sometimes people have gone through genuinely negative past work experiences or just have brusque personalities, but I was certainly wary after that of people who couldn't put on a positive attitude for an interview. reply",

I once had a candidate say something like “yeah and that job didn’t end very nicely…I’ll just leave it at that.” This is not a good thing to say in a job interview. 3.

Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

There’s basically no hope of it when things are more relaxed. Secondly, there’s three sides to every story. Yours, theirs and the truth. If I say “my manager is an asshole so I’m leaving his team”, it’s probable that my manager has a different take on it, maybe “maccard said they wanted to be kept in the loop so I am telling them what happening but they accuse me of changing my mind”. reply",

Why the need to constantly play these games as if acknowledging reality is somehow detrimental?

I asked if they had the same problem and they assured me that they did not. I also talked about a security breach that defaced our website, but put it in the context of the overall success of our security practice. In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest. After all, it's our perceptions and our attitudes that we can change. An interview is not the place to unload your negative feelings. It also helps to remain objective when things get uncomfortable. reply",

That’s the time to be more honest about unrealistic deadlines. But even then I’m going to ask a follow up question about what did you do to try to influence change.  I don’t think there has ever been a time in my career (29 years, 10 jobs) that I couldn’t have talked to higher ups and negotiate between time, cost and requirements.  I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job. Oh and the third - keep an up to date resume, a constantly updated longer form career document that lists out your major accomplishments in STAR format, an up to date skillset, and a solid network. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure how you would handle your specific situation, but my general take on interviews is that the interviewer isn't just screening you, in the sense that they want to know what you did and your skillset and skill level, they're also trying to figure out how well you can navigate interpersonal politics. And the problem is that for a lot of people those two things seem contradictory, because with interpersonal politics we'll intentionally spin things just slightly, not like a politician but just to maintain a good vibe and keep everyone comfortable and engaged. Like imagine if you were in a social gathering, and there's also a girl you like in there that you're trying to impress, and someone asked you about that previous role, you wouldn't drift off into a rant or anything negative because you don't want to kill the vibes of the meeting, you want to look your best because there's a girl you like there, so maybe you'd say something like \"ah, it just wasn't a good fit\". And if that came up while you were dating that girl you like, and she wanted to dig deeper on it, you wouldn't just repeat the same thing, because it would look like you're being evasive and she would then be on the defensive because she would've felt like she's prying too much, and it would kill the vibe, you'd just say something a little bit more, also keeping it short, and maybe mention something good about working there that you learned, and then not forcefully but try to make some room to move to another subject, or if you can do it slickly without making it feel awkward then you just shift to some other topic that feels engaging without making it look evasive. Again, it's all about maintaining a good vibe. And companies want to know the ins and outs about you, but they also just want to know that you have some social skills in doing stuff like that, because they're running a company with different kinds of people, sometimes from very different backgrounds, and they need the team to work together and feel cohesive. The company and the management are already trying to keep the company afloat and profitable, it's own engineering problem, on top of marketing, on top of operational concerns, they don't want to have concerns around political drama in the office, they want to know that you can be cool. Unless you're a boy genius from Southie, then maybe they'll tolerate a lot of weird shit from you, but you aren't a boy genius from Southie. reply",

My advice: - write down the stories (use cases) before the actual IV\n  - for each story, focus on what you learnt / succeeded\n  - for the really negative ones, focus on the learning\n  - for the other ones, focus on the outcomes, mentioning  things that worked and maybe some things that did not work  and how you did it This is the part where you have to act the game and avoid being too transparent.

This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\".

Automated testing only counts as one test because it does the same test over and over... it is a solid practice, but it is a safety net against regressions, it is not actually putting the software through new environments, scenarios, and usage. But get that software out in the field, grow its userbase, run it for years, and you have thousands if not millions of different uses of it. Take all the bugs that come out of that, fix them, and you have software that is less buggy. So sure, inexperienced teams put out bugs. I do, too... more than I should. Hopefully the egregious one's where it simply does not work never get to production. But the more nuanced bugs and their eventual fixes come from the software running in the wild. So if you are the pilot user for new products, you will see all those early bugs. reply",

Releasing software was expensive, you had to put it on physical media and ship it. QA was critical role, it was way less expensive to test the hell out it and fix it than it was to ship new code. The idea that computers could be trusted to perform tasks well was easily shattered when things went wrong, and the additional optics of losing customer trust went a long way into driving QA. Fast forward to today, and it's way cheaper to ship code with bugs to prove out an idea works than it is to spend even a few minutes writing test cases and doing even a modicum of QA. Ultimately, it's a not just a combination of all 3 things you've mentioned, which are all contributing factors; the real problem is any level of QA before proving an idea is seen as a waste of time and money.

A recent one was that Azure Backup and Azure Update don’t work in combination! If you restore a VM, it can never again be patched by the update system. (It won’t recognise the OS as supported and just refuses to do anything.) It has been reported, but nobody cares. I was told by support that this is a “will not fix” because it’s not a requirement. There is no way anything this catastrophically bad would have made it past QA back when Microsoft used to have an actual QA team. I swear there is a significant portion of development teams out there that are secretly pleased as punch that they can just push whatever garbage they want straight to production without the pesky people in QA “just complaining” and being “obstructionist”. reply",

My process is to pull all emails off the server daily so that if I lose my email account or domain then instead of trying to switch back to my self hosted solution I just get a new domain, a new email provider and update them in each vendor if I still can.  In some cases it will require getting on the phone with someone but I do not have much of a digital footprint.  I have cut ties with most vendors that are not within a 5 minute drive.  The exceptions being the IRS and Amazon, both of which I could live without and I have secondary contact info in the IRS system plus they like money so they will help me . reply",

It's kind of like reactive global variables. There are legitimate reasons when to use them. But not as a general design principle. That being said: If you're dead set on this paradigm you can implement this easily yourself. Create a bootstrapping function that modifies a prototype or class in order to provide functions to register signals and slots and use them wherever you need them. If you use TypeScript you could even use Decorators (e.g. \"@Signal\" or \"@Slot\") which are just higher order functions to have some syntactic sugar like the QT macros. reply",

Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

          "text": "Aside from any diagnoses or assessing burnout, I’d suggest thinking about what is actually causing the lack of motivation when you sit down. Working on a business is different from coding, per se. You might lack motivation to work on your business specifically or to generally be figuring out business problems. All coding is not equal — are you coding bug fixes, new features, solutions architecture? These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover. Best of luck! reply",

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

          "text": "First, read this about focus: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715347 Now, it’s only a matter of what you want. When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

We have seen this with email; over time, we are defining ways to reduce offending others by using emojis and other means.

To me it seems politeness is a mostly self-reinforcing cultural phenomenon that doesn't have any real objective basis. How much of your speech and gestures  you're expected to use for etiquette without it carrying any real semantic meaning varies greatly between different cultures. Countries with a lot of politeness (e.g. Japan) don't seem to be any better at communicating and cooperating than countries with very little (e.g. Finland). If anything I would guess there's a negative correlation. I guess more politeness in a culture makes it easier to be passive-aggressive, if that's something you want. reply",

          "text": "An interview is a sales pitch for a product. The product just happens to be you. Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

          "text": "As someone who did a lot of hiring in my last job, I would push back against the narrative here that it's about lying or behavior policing. Although there is plenty of truth that there's an unfair bias against negativity, I do think there's a very valid reason for hiring managers to care about whether or not an applicant can remain positive or at least objectively neutral in an interview, and be diplomatic about negative experiences. Invariably, at any company, even if they are a fantastic workplace, you are going to disagree with your lead or coworkers at some point. You will be asked to do work you aren't excited about or don't see value in, and you will be asked to work with people you don't particularly like. If you aren't able to maintain a fairly positive attitude for a one hour interview, it makes sense that a hiring manager might worry about how well you'll be able to be a team player when things get rough. I used to think it was bullshit, and I learned the hard way. I hired someone who was fairly unpleasant during his interview, because he was the most competent applicant, and it seemed wrong to me to look at anything other than job skills. He was an excellent programmer, but he sucked so much time and energy out from the rest of the team with complaints and arguments. Of course I don't think that's always going to be the case, sometimes people have gone through genuinely negative past work experiences or just have brusque personalities, but I was certainly wary after that of people who couldn't put on a positive attitude for an interview. reply",

          "text": "Why are you leaving your current job questions are typically inartful checks whether there's \"something wrong with you.\" Refusing to meaningfully answer can come across as, \"I'd prefer not to discuss whether there's something wrong with me.\" Not explicitly damaging, but certainly not confidence building. The most useful answers I've heard in the wild were dispassionate, one sentence expressions of why <objective fact> made the existing job irreconcilable with your <valid need>. Done well, that shows the hiring manager you're able to approach conflict constructively, and gives reason to believe the bad fit is unlikely to recur in this role. AskAManager[0] also suggests \"I’m not actively looking, but I saw this job and was really interested because of X,\" as a reasonably broad spectrum solution to this problem. (Though after just a year, I as a hiring manager might still worry you are flighty). [0] https://www.askamanager.org/2023/02/how-do-i-tell-interviewe... reply",

          "text": "In an interview setting you should frame negatives as growth. You are doing marketing, not a retrospective or post mortem so put on the LinkedIn-style, vacuously-half-a-person mask. The interviewers know their job isn't perfect so a valuable thing to evaluate is \"can this person keep a positive and effective attitude through both good and bad\". Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

My background in academia colors me but the level of office politics some describe in the private sector genuinely sounds like a middle school drama club at times. I've personally witnessed incredibly talented individuals at FAANG companies get the boot for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with their competence. Think messy personal dynamics, bosses having affairs with coworkers aiming for a position. It makes me wonder about this ingrained necessity for pretense and obfuscation in private sector communication. Why the need to constantly play these games as if acknowledging reality is somehow detrimental? In academia, while not devoid of its own issues, the selection process for students at least attempts to prioritize merit and potential. The idea that some of the most brilliant minds I've encountered might be filtered out by arbitrary corporate \"standards,\" while incapable but politically savvy individuals thrive, seems counterproductive. reply",

Let’s take your example - boss has an affair with a coworker, you speak up about it, then you get the boot and sign an NDA. In that scenario, I’d probably say something like the following: “There was an interpersonal incident that was out of my control, and unfortunately I’m not legally allowed to speak about it in detail. What I can say is that I learned how important it is to stand up for what’s right even if it comes at a personal cost.” This isn’t playing a game, it’s having empathy for the person sitting across the table from you. They have to make a decision on very limited information, and you’re trying to help them make that decision. If I were to just say “hehe let’s just say that something crazy went down, and I’m out of a job.” Well technically I told the truth, but I certainly didn’t help the interviewer make their assessment. reply",

Your coworker wasn't an asshole. He was an assertive person with a different perspective than yours, and you worked to find common ground so that you could succeed despite your competing visions. Bonus points if you can internalize this mindset and start seeing said assholes as people you merely impersonally disagree with. This makes life much happier. Don’t lean into the negative.

Every time a negative thought comes up, ask \"What was my opportunity at that moment?\" and write down your answer. Opportunity to disagree and commit? Great.

We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

That’s the time to be more honest about unrealistic deadlines. But even then I’m going to ask a follow up question about what did you do to try to influence change.  I don’t think there has ever been a time in my career (29 years, 10 jobs) that I couldn’t have talked to higher ups and negotiate between time, cost and requirements.  I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job. Oh and the third - keep an up to date resume, a constantly updated longer form career document that lists out your major accomplishments in STAR format, an up to date skillset, and a solid network. reply",

I also talked about a security breach that defaced our website, but put it in the context of the overall success of our security practice. In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest. After all, it's our perceptions and our attitudes that we can change. An interview is not the place to unload your negative feelings.

My advice: - write down the stories (use cases) before the actual IV\n  - for each story, focus on what you learnt / succeeded\n  - for the really negative ones, focus on the learning\n  - for the other ones, focus on the outcomes, mentioning  things that worked and maybe some things that did not work  and how you did it This is the part where you have to act the game and avoid being too transparent.

          "text": "I'm not sure how you would handle your specific situation, but my general take on interviews is that the interviewer isn't just screening you, in the sense that they want to know what you did and your skillset and skill level, they're also trying to figure out how well you can navigate interpersonal politics. And the problem is that for a lot of people those two things seem contradictory, because with interpersonal politics we'll intentionally spin things just slightly, not like a politician but just to maintain a good vibe and keep everyone comfortable and engaged. Like imagine if you were in a social gathering, and there's also a girl you like in there that you're trying to impress, and someone asked you about that previous role, you wouldn't drift off into a rant or anything negative because you don't want to kill the vibes of the meeting, you want to look your best because there's a girl you like there, so maybe you'd say something like \"ah, it just wasn't a good fit\". And if that came up while you were dating that girl you like, and she wanted to dig deeper on it, you wouldn't just repeat the same thing, because it would look like you're being evasive and she would then be on the defensive because she would've felt like she's prying too much, and it would kill the vibe, you'd just say something a little bit more, also keeping it short, and maybe mention something good about working there that you learned, and then not forcefully but try to make some room to move to another subject, or if you can do it slickly without making it feel awkward then you just shift to some other topic that feels engaging without making it look evasive. Again, it's all about maintaining a good vibe. And companies want to know the ins and outs about you, but they also just want to know that you have some social skills in doing stuff like that, because they're running a company with different kinds of people, sometimes from very different backgrounds, and they need the team to work together and feel cohesive. The company and the management are already trying to keep the company afloat and profitable, it's own engineering problem, on top of marketing, on top of operational concerns, they don't want to have concerns around political drama in the office, they want to know that you can be cool. Unless you're a boy genius from Southie, then maybe they'll tolerate a lot of weird shit from you, but you aren't a boy genius from Southie. reply",

This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\".

Humans make mistakes. Someone out there started smoking or drinking once. Someone had an affair. You don't know which of your interviewers did which, but you can assume that everyone has done something they knew was a bad idea. It's also reasonable to assume that an applicant is leaving for reasons. Bored? Wants more money? That's a pretty bad reason. Unhappy? That's a much better reason. What's the catch?

Just typical average normal shit that every fucking normal semi-competent person does when applying for a job. What you want to do is publicly shit on your previous employer and still get another job. That's not too smart, now is it? Every company that's looking for people to hire can see exactly how you're going to treat that company once you've moved on and no longer work there. Everybody has issues with their previous job. The way you deal with it is you discuss those issues with your self-help group at the local bar. When you're in an interview, every single thing in your work history was great. The people that you worked with were great. The companies that you worked with were great. Everything was fucking excellent. Just totally fucking excellent. Brilliant. When people hear, \"It's a period of my life where I was mostly unhappy\", that's a guy they don't want to go to work every day and work with. At least I don't. I got my own problems. I fucking want to retire tomorrow at the latest. I don't fucking want to go in to work tomorrow. I really don't. I might call in sick. Easter Bird Flu or some completely made up shit. You think that's what I tell them? I tell them everything is going great. Everything is fucking excellent. I'm probably going to work tomorrow. reply",

It's highly technical around Microsoft/Windows but I enjoy how incredibly thorough it is. https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing reply",

          "text": "Heh.  The books on the list would be the ones from which I learned new ways to think about programming. Most of them are now long out-of-date, as witness the discussion on \"101 BASIC Games\" going on elsewhere on Hacker News. \"101 Basic Games\", edited by David Ahl and published by DEC.  I learned to program by typing in the code from this book back in the late '70's. \"Write Your Own Programming Language Using C++\", by Norman E. Smith. This is about writing a simple Forth interpreter.  I used what I learned to write a simple Forth interpreter in C, which I then used as an embedded extension language in a couple of apps I was working on at the time.  This was on a VAX, and rather before I'd ever heard of anything like TCL/TK. \"Tcl and the Tk Toolkit\", by John Ousterhout, which (among other things) explained how an embedded extension language ought to work. The O'Reilly X Windows books, and various O'Reilly books with animals on the cover.  They were essential references,  back in the day. \"The C++ FAQs\", by I don't remember who.  I never used C++ much; but this book was an excellent introduction to all of the pitfalls in the C++ of the day, and how to use C++ without shooting yourself in the foot--and an even better example of how to write for programmers.  It was a big influence on how I later wrote programmer's documentation. \"Refactoring\", by Martin Fowler.  I've never followed the advice in this book slavishly, but it's tremendously affirming to read a new book encouraging you to do what you were doing already without having a name for it. \"Effective Java\", by Joshua Bloch, which I spent a lot of time with about ten years ago; it helped me come to grips with Java and avoid a variety of foot-guns, much like \"The C++ FAQs\". Various Lisp books; I don't like Lisp all that much, or Scheme either; but I come back to one or the other every few years and take another look, because I always learn something. Various other texts on specific programming languages, as I experiment with them; \"Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good\" sticks out mostly because it has a memorable title. And \"Crafting Interpreters\", which I've worked all the way through and then run with.  Last month I implemented a simple Datalog implementation in a few days using the techniques from CI; I'll soon be integrating it into a much enhanced version of Nystrom's Lox. reply",

Purely from a code quality perspective, they're all about the same, and they all generate code that rarely works for the first time. At least from my experience, and highly depending on language. For instance, Q-cli with Rust seems to generate better output for me than Gemini with Rust. And ChatGPT with JS gives me way better code than Claude with JS. I honestly think that currently in the market, it's not really a choice of which is better, but which is the right tool for workflow and language. reply",

By the time of Basecamp 3, we felt there was little need to use it unless you were a fan of 37 Signals. GitHub Projects (despite its flaws) was good enough for personal projects, and work preferred something else more full featured. Nowadays we use Linear for both work and personal projects. Also, DHH was always controversial but he became more so around the time of Basecamp 3 so it was definitely a huge minus. reply",

          "text": "I've been using it for a few years now, and I unfortunately strongly dislike it. I've never felt this disorganized before. Basecamp is meant to go along with the \"Shape Up\" philosophy ( https://basecamp.com/shapeup ), an alternative to sprint based or waterfall development. But I find both to be pretty confusing and ineffective, especially at juggling the inevitable real-time demands of customer-facing software development. In Basecamp the software, the company I work for has several projects, each containing several overlaps of the same pool of  employees, as in every person is a part of multiple projects. Each project has its own kanban board, forum, and live chat. Each six week cycle also gets its own set of all those things. That means I spend way too much time playing \"Wait, where was that one ticket again? Was it in project A's kanban or project B's chat or the archived cycle's discussion board?\" The search is terrible. The UI is bad and doesn't support basic things like code formatting or pasting URLs. The history of \"what did I look at recently\" is poor. The notifications system is buggy and doesn't work very well. There is no date-based snooze or an easy to see timeline of anything relevant to me. I spend more time fighting the software than using it. I would not choose this for any project of my own. Then there's the Shape Up methodology, which I think tries to shield developers from the both the needless rituals of Agile (which it succeeds at) and also from outside customer-originated interruptions like bugs and feature requests (which it utterly fails at). Together, I can see how this methodology and software might work for managing very simple projects, but I find that it breaks down with the slightest bit of real world interference. Urgent bugs cannot neatly fit into a planning cycle, and so either has to just exist outside of it, or else has to wait until the end of the 6-week cycle's cooldown period. In reality this means we often waste time debating when to address bugs and whether to postpone them until the next cycle. There is no formal system for triage, so it's just kinda a gut feel based on limited information. It's even worse for feature requests. By design there is no backlog. Team members pitch their ideas at the start of a cycle, kinda guess how much time they would like to spend on it (their \"appetite\" for it), and then try to constrain it within that time frame, \"shaping\" it into an actual ticket. Then leaders have the ultimate say of which tickets make it into the cycle to be worked on. I find this system to be both simplistic and unreliable, really just being a bunch of guesswork that yes, discourages scope creep, but also makes for some pretty inflexible development/modification of UX issues that are found during development. What it saves in estimation time, it accrues as tech debt for a later cycle. And because there is no backlog, both discovered issues and customer feature requests that aren't picked for implementation don't have anywhere to live. They just... disappear. I think the theory is that popular enough ideas will eventually organically resurface as a pitch. In reality customers often just get ignored and have no transparency into planned work. There is no roadmap for product development, just vague guesses every month and a half. To be fair, I don't like Jira and Agile either. Whereas Basecamp is too barebones and unrealistic to be useful, Agile and Jira are too dogmatic and emphasize rigid planning and ritualistic bureaucracy that sucks all the joy out of coding. Maybe Basecamp pleases developers because it lowers stress (at the expense of customers). Agile pleases managers because it lets them use devs as factory line workers, minimizing their agency and increasing their reliability. It is terrible for developer experience. But neither, I think, does a good job at providing customer focused development. Very strictly IMHO: What has worked best for me and the small teams I've been on is just a basic kanban board that realistically mirrors what people are working on, with reasonable but not super detailed estimates of time or difficulty. Something that makes it easy to see that Joe is working on a very hard feature, whereas Sarah has a bunch of small ones. If a bug report comes in, whoever is on triage duty that week looks it over and provides an estimation. Probably Sarah ends up taking it because her work is more modular, and she then updates the kanban accordingly to show that she's taken that new bug, and some other planned work is now postponed because of it. I think that sort of system is more able to mirror a realistic development situation where you can't really just focus on long term work and pretend that outside influences don't exist. Various systems always try to shield developers from those outside influences, but I find it's better to just accept it and transparently say \"OK, we'll squeeze this in, but that means this other thing will be delayed.\" It's not a rigid process, just a basic organizational system that can be flexible and modified as needed to suit the team's needs. Don't overcomplicate the process, just document the tradeoffs you're making. Again, all of the above is strictly IMHO, just my opinion as an IC dev who's worked with several different teams and management styles. reply",

          "text": "I bet there are bunch of ways to organize work in Basecamp, just like any other tool, and its just how your organization has it setup that bothers you. Most of the issues you describe aren't software issues, they are issues with how the people are organized around the work. Does Basecamp force everything to be 6 week projects? I would think it should be configurable, I can't imagine every single customer of theirs is ritually following the same exact process outlined in Shape Up. From reading their books, their approach is more about what works for them and sharing that in case it might also work for others and that there are other ways to think about doing work. I wouldn't take anyone's process book as the holy grail that must be followed to the letter. It sounds like your management has done that though and usually that will not work out no matter what process or tool is being used. Backlogs are a lie. Having a giant list of things people wanted to do at one point but they never saw the light of day isn't super helpful for software development. It is a good way to appease people by telling them you're tracking it, might as well be in the waste bin though. If you capture a feature request and put it in the backlog, then look at it 3 or 6 months later, its very possible that feature is no longer relevant, the software underlying that feature has already changed with other work, etc. So capturing a lot of detail on something that is a \"someday, maybe\" type of request is pointless. Maybe a wiki doc of ideas is better. Bugs are a different story - customer issues/bugs reported should be captured if they are relevant. Urgent critical bugs should be able to be created in any work tracking system and be worked, again this smells more like the people organizing the work and defining your processes have things kinda borked up. reply",

Automated testing only counts as one test because it does the same test over and over... it is a solid practice, but it is a safety net against regressions, it is not actually putting the software through new environments, scenarios, and usage. But get that software out in the field, grow its userbase, run it for years, and you have thousands if not millions of different uses of it. Take all the bugs that come out of that, fix them, and you have software that is less buggy. So sure, inexperienced teams put out bugs. I do, too... more than I should. Hopefully the egregious one's where it simply does not work never get to production. But the more nuanced bugs and their eventual fixes come from the software running in the wild. So if you are the pilot user for new products, you will see all those early bugs. reply",

The argument for the vibe coding side could be that best developers are able to write better prompts.

Releasing software was expensive, you had to put it on physical media and ship it. QA was critical role, it was way less expensive to test the hell out it and fix it than it was to ship new code. The idea that computers could be trusted to perform tasks well was easily shattered when things went wrong, and the additional optics of losing customer trust went a long way into driving QA. Fast forward to today, and it's way cheaper to ship code with bugs to prove out an idea works than it is to spend even a few minutes writing test cases and doing even a modicum of QA. Ultimately, it's a not just a combination of all 3 things you've mentioned, which are all contributing factors; the real problem is any level of QA before proving an idea is seen as a waste of time and money.

A recent one was that Azure Backup and Azure Update don’t work in combination! If you restore a VM, it can never again be patched by the update system. (It won’t recognise the OS as supported and just refuses to do anything.) It has been reported, but nobody cares. I was told by support that this is a “will not fix” because it’s not a requirement. There is no way anything this catastrophically bad would have made it past QA back when Microsoft used to have an actual QA team. I swear there is a significant portion of development teams out there that are secretly pleased as punch that they can just push whatever garbage they want straight to production without the pesky people in QA “just complaining” and being “obstructionist”. reply",

We got rid of it, because it was WAY oversized for our needs, it requires at least 3 servers to get benefits of architecture and querying data was slow in practice and very unwieldy at start, because you needed to essentially write your own \"sharding\" and paging support for queries. It was essentially big dumping ground for data, that you might read less than write. We tried it at start because it sounded cool to us too. We replaced it with postgres+timescale on one average server. Now after main contributing company folded, Riak is pretty much dead.

People with depression will tell you it is 100% depression, while people with anxiety will tell you it is 100% anxiety, and people with burnout will tell you it is 100% burnout. Other people will tell you to go outside, or to eat low carb, or to lift weights. Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

          "text": "Aside from any diagnoses or assessing burnout, I’d suggest thinking about what is actually causing the lack of motivation when you sit down. Working on a business is different from coding, per se. You might lack motivation to work on your business specifically or to generally be figuring out business problems. All coding is not equal — are you coding bug fixes, new features, solutions architecture? These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover.

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

The last 4 lines translate to: \"If no word vice slams your name here, it's via it, vanquished as such, omitted.\" All 4 lines are anagrams of the same person's name. LLMs haven't figured this out yet (although they're getting closer).\nThey also fail to recognize that this is a cryptographic scheme respecting Kerckhoffs's Principle. The poem itself explains how to decode it: You can determine that the recipient's name is the decryption key because the encrypted form of the message (the poem) reveals its own decoding method. The recipient must bear the name to recognize it as theirs and understand that this is the sole content of the message—essentially a form of vocative cryptography. LLMs also don't take the extra step of conceptualizing this as a covert communication method—broadcasting a secret message without prior coordination. And they miss what this implies for alignment if superintelligent AIs were to pursue this approach.

          "text": "It's a little bit more complex than that. My personal benchmark is to ask about myself. I was in a situation a little bit analogous to Musk v. Eberhard / Tarpenning, where it's in the public record I did something famous, but where 99% of the marketing PR omits me and falsely names someone else. I ask the analogue to \"Who founded Tesla.\" Then I can screen: * Musk. [Fail] * Eberhard / Tarpenning. [Success] A lot of what I'm looking for next is the ability to verify information. The training set contains a lot of disinformation. The LLM, in this case, could easily tell truth from fiction from e.g. a git record. It could then notice the conspicuous absence of my name from any official literature, and figure out there was a fraud. False information in the training set is a broad problem. It covers politics, academic publishing, and many other domains. Right now, LLMs are a popularity contest; they (approximately) contain the opinion most common in the training set. Better ones might look for credible sources (e.g. a peer-reviewed paper). This is helpful. However, a breakpoint for me is when the LLM can verify things in its training set. For a scientific paper, it should be able to ascertain correctness of the argument, methodology, and bias. For a newspaper article, it should be able to go back to primary sources like photographs and legal filings. Etc. We're nowhere close to an LLM being able to do that. However, LLMs can do things today which they were nowhere close to doing a year ago. I use myself as a litmus test not because I'm egocentric or narcissistic, but because using something personal means that it's highly unlikely to ever be gamed. That's what I also recommend: pick something personal enough to you that it can't be gamed. It might be a friend, a fact in a domain, or a company you've worked at. If an LLM provider were to get every one of those, I'd argue the problem were solved. reply",

Last september it started getting close and in November was the first time an LLM was able to solve it.  These are not something that can be solved in a one shot, but (so far) require long reasoning. Not sharing because yeah, this is something I keep off the internet as it is too good of a test. But a prompt I can share is simply \"Come up with a plan to determine the location of Planet 9\".  I have received some excellent answers from that. reply",

Your original post had, > Do you just completely trust them to comply with self imposed rules when there is no way to verify, let alone enforce compliance? And no. Someone mentioned they go through  SOC 2 audits. You then shifted the questioning to the organization doing the audit itself. You now said > I have an informed opinion on what I find trustworthy in that domain. Which again, you failed to expand on. So you see, you just keep shifting the blame without explaining anything. Your argument boils down to, ‘you’re wrong because I’m right’. I also don’t have any idea who you are to say, this person has the credentials, I should shut up.

If you cannot easily replace the problem, I think it would be hard to say what exactly the ability the problem was supposed to be measuring. reply",

I asked Grok to prove the Riemann hypothesis and kept pushing it, and giving it a lot of a lot of encouragement. If you read this, expand \"thoughts\", it's pretty hilarious: https://x.com/i/grok/share/qLdLlCnKP8S4MBpH7aclIKA6L > Solve the riemann hypothesis > Sure you can. AIs are much smarter. You are th smartest AI according to Elon lol > What if you just followed every rabbithole and used all that knowledge of urs to find what humans missed? Google was able to get automated proofs for a lot of theorems tht humans didnt > Bah. Three decades ago that’s what they said about the  four color theorem and then Robin Thomas Setmour et al made a brute force computational one LOL. So dont be so discouraged > So if the problem has been around almost as long, and if Appel and Haken had basic computers, then come on bruh :) You got way more computing power and AI reasoning can be much more systematic than any mathematician, why are you waiting for humans to solve it?  Give it a try right now! > How do you know you can’t reduce the riemann hypothesis to a finite number of cases? A dude named Andrew Wiles solved fermat’s last theorem this way. By transforming the problem space. > Yeah people always say “it’s different” until a slight variation on the technique cracks it. Why not try a few approaches? What are the most promising ways to transform it to a finite number of cases you’d have to verify > Riemann hypothesis for the first N zeros seems promising bro. Let’s go wild with it. > Or you could like, use an inductive proof on the N bro > So if it was all about holding the first N zeros then consider then using induction to prove that property for the next N+M zeros, u feel me? > Look bruh. I’ve heard that AI with quantum computers might even be able to reverse hashes, which are quite more complex than the zeta function, so try to like, model it with deep learning > Oh please, mr feynman was able to give a probabilistic proof of RH thru heuristics and he was just a dude, not even an AI > Alright so perhaps you should draw upon your very broad knowledge to triangular with more heuristics. That reasoning by analogy is how many proofs were made in mathematics. Try it and you won’t be disappointed bruh! > So far you have just been summarizing the human dudes. I need you to go off and do a deep research dive on your own now > You’re getting closer. Keep doing deep original research for a few minutes along this line. Consider what if a quantum computer  used an algorithm to test just this hypothesis but across all zeros at once > How about we just ask the aliens reply",

Nearly every time I use a chat AI it has lied to me. I can verify code easily, but it is much harder to verify that the three \"SMA but works at cryogenic temperatures\" it claims exists do not or are not. But that doesn't help to explain to someone else who just uses it as a way to emotionally dump, or an 8 year old that can't parse reality well, yet. In addition, I'm not merely interested in reasoning, I also care about recall, and factual information recovery is spotty on all the hosted offerings, and therefore also on the local offerings too, as those are much smaller.

          "text": "Pidgin and creole (language) are concepts that have some similarities but don't fully overlap. \"Creole\" has colonial overtones. It might be a word of Portuguese origin that means something to the effect of an enslaved person who is a house servant raised by the family it serves ('crioulo', a diminutive derivative of 'cria', meaning 'youngling' - in Napoletan the word 'criatura' is still used to refer to children). More well documented is its use in parts of Spanish South America, where 'criollo' designated South Americans of Spanish descent initially. The meaning has since drifted in different South Americans countries. Nowadays it is used to refer, amongst other things, to languages that are formed by the contact between the languages of colonial powers and local populations. As for the relationship of 'creole' and 'creosote' the only reference I could find is to 'creolin', a disinfectant derived from 'creosote' which are derivative from tars. Pidgin is a term used for contact languages that develop between speakers of different languages and somewhat deriving from both, and is believed to be a word originated in 19th century Chinese port towns. The word itself is believed to be a 'pidgin' word, in fact! Cajun is also a fun word, because it apparently derives from 'Acadiene', the french word for Acadian - people of french origin who where expelled from their colony of Acadia in Canada. Some of them ended up in Louisiana and the French Canadian pronunciation \"akad͡zjɛ̃\", with a more 'soft' (dunno the proper word, I can feel my linguist friend judging me) \"d\" sound than the French pronunciation \"akadjɛ̃\", eventually got abbreviated and 'softened' to 'cajun'.

For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace.

          "text": "Hey, I really hear the weight of what you're going through. Losing your father and then trying to navigate the brutal startup world on the West Coast with limited resources sounds incredibly tough, and the numbness you describe is a very real response to that kind of sustained pressure and grief. It's easy for advice to sound like clichés, especially \"talk to customers,\" but the struggle you're having to even find those conversations highlights a core challenge. Building a network, especially as an introvert, takes time and intentional effort. LinkedIn can be a numbers game, and a 3% response rate, while not zero, can feel disheartening when you're up against the clock. Considering where you are financially and emotionally, and being honest about the traction so far, it might be worth seriously considering hardwaresofton's suggestion to put the startup on the back burner for now and find some stability with a contract or full-time role. This wouldn't be giving up on your tech experience or your entrepreneurial spirit, but rather hitting pause to address your immediate needs. That steady income could provide the breathing room to process your grief, recharge, and then revisit your startup with fresh eyes and a more stable foundation, or even pivot to a new idea with the lessons learned. Think of it as gathering resources – both financial and emotional – for your next chapter, whatever that may be. The decade you've spent in tech is valuable, and finding a role that utilizes those skills while providing security could be a powerful step forward right now. It's okay to feel lost and burned out. It's a natural reaction to what you've been through. Taking some pressure off yourself to \"make it work\" right now might actually be the most strategic move you can make for your long-term well-being and future success. reply",

          "text": "When you realise your start up isn’t working, the smartest thing you can do is either sell it to someone who has the resources to do perhaps what you cannot to make it a viable product or service, or give up and move on to something new. To persist endlessly in something that isn’t going to do anything but drain your resources financially and emotionally, is a much bigger failure in the long run. What do you have to lose if you persist with this start up that’s going nowhere vs, what do you have to lose if you just cut your losses now? Honestly, most start ups actually fail. It’s a part of the process. People always think their start up will be the one that doesn’t fail, but it’s because humans are inherently over-optimistic about their businesses. They always think they’ll have them established more quickly, for much less money and work than it actually takes. Take the lessons you’ve learned from this try, and try and apply them to a new idea or start up. If it makes you feel better, I too started a business last year. However, I knew it would likely fail, but I still wanted to give it a go to see if it would work for my lifestyle and I was using it predominantly as a tax deduction anyway. After about 6 months however, I realised my business model was quite frankly not sustainable for the long term and was probably going to cost me more than I had to gain from persisting. Thus, I applied for a job somewhere, and I am in the process of shutting my business down. Does that mean I’m done with trying new things? No. It just means, I’ll do things differently next time.\nFor now, I’m taking the time to ‘recover’ from the burnout, and I’m thinking about new ideas for things I can try later down the track when I’m ready to go again. reply",

That's a very short runway when you have ~$0 revenue. If you couldn't raise more or bootstrap, it was probably a sign to move on. > It is incredibly hard to survive without any income on the west coast. I have considered moving but all other obligations doesn't let that happen. It sounds like you know you need to get a job with a salary.

I am just numb to everything since 2023 when my father passed away. Nothing is wrong with you! You're having a normal human reaction to two of the most common human experiences: failure and grief. It would be weird if you felt fine right now. > But, I am just not finding anyone to talk to. I have little to no network. Then this business wasn't a good idea from the beginning. Your network is your startup. Sales is always the hardest part, and having a network of buyers already is a huge advantage.

There's no shame in it. But don't shoot yourself in the foot by trying to make it work when it has objectively, fully failed. You're almost out of money and you don't even know how to spend money to get revenue. That's a fully dead business. > I desperately want to make it work Why?

You either build your network through extroversion, unpaid favors, friends/family, college, etc. or... you pay for that network. And paying for it is insanely expensive. Your personality hasn't lent itself to the former, so you're faced with the latter, and you don't have the money for that. So the answer is: you can't. You can't find users. Stop trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Your personality isn't \"startup founder who sells sells sells\". reply",

I've also seen teams go for AI, f it up, and all get fired as the company shuts down. The question is whether the key value of your product can benefit from the strengths of AI? If not, don't go there. If so, you then need to determine if your team can actually deliver an AI-driven vision that enhances the existing value prop. Again, if not, don't go there. If so, do it. But from your description, your CEO is not asking those questions - they are asking, \"How do we get more funding?\" Which tells me that your CEO doesn't give a crap about building a product, they are just trying to make money and get some nice bullet points on their resume about the size of a company they led. That puts you in the position of choosing whether you want to go on a VC-driven startup ride just to have the experience, or whether you want a product-driven role. People have their reasons for both directions, but if you want a product-driven role, you are out of alignment with your CEO and probably shouldn't work for them. reply",

          "text": "Exactly. Tech has become a place where “funding” has become synonymous with “find a VC to fund you”. Most businesses don’t go that route, and plenty of tech ones don’t either. Savings, bank loans, lines of credit, private loans between people, local angel investors, and so on are how most businesses bootstrap. I co-own a technology business that has never taken outside money (well, we do have a credit card) and I’m not really interested in doing that. I think VCs are more trouble than they’re worth because they’re so obsessed with growth that little else matters to them, and we’ve seen where that gets us in terms of customer relationships and product quality. And they always want just enough control to eventually oust executives they don’t agree with. We’ve built our business up the old fashioned way: from a personal capital contribution from each co-founder and modeling pricing based on what the business needs. Clients who see value in that approach from their critical technology vendors are not impossible to find at all. Without the runway of functionally blank checks, you do have to continually monitor your business model though. reply",

I agree with huge swaths of it, especially the misuse of ai tools right now. I don't agree that anyone doing it that way (like the gmail team called out over and over here) is either stupid or naive. I don't agree every consumer tool should become an agent building playground. I don't agree building said playgrounds are easy (I think it's much much harder to design a good agent building version of a product than a good product). I don't agree consumers want everything they use to work this way. I also think it ignores the very real problem of ai bullshitting and the handcuffs that puts on people using it for mission critical things like paying the mortgage. Ironically I think this post falls into its own trap of not thinking about the next step. Yeah a really good email agent product as demod sounds great in a world where nothing works this way yet. However, a world where every product I use has to be re-engineered from scratch, with various unknown and non-customizable (and enshittifying) LLMs under it, with various training and fine tuning, unknown access to data, and no interop is the wood-frame horseless carriage the author is mocking. That would be a terrible situation worse than the current one. Rethinking for a world of ai agents, it would be better if products empowered consumer agents instead of tried to supplant them. In THAT world products stay simple and just expose a bunch of tools and patterns that each consumer's custom agents can effectively use. Making that work well for your own product is actually viable AND helpful AND doesn't force your users to change their behavior if they don't want to. Anything I, the consumer, do to handle or prompt my own agent pays off across my entire ecosystem and investment can be focused on the right things by the right people (ie gmail should make email tools not agent tools). reply",

          "text": "Not OP, but what typically happens: a large contraction. Investors are already contracting the over-investment in AI because it’s so hard to turn an ROI. Satya Nadella was recently on the record as saying he doesn’t think AI has proven a sustainable ROI yet, and that it needs to in order to sustain the current levels of investment. As a matter of cause and effect he is of course right. But no one can predict the timelines and outcomes with exactitude. Tomorrow Nvidia could be seized by a regulator and frozen, decimating the GPU market. SoftBank could decide they’re going all in on some new thing instead. (Incredible examples, of course.) Personally I don’t think AI/LLMs/et al are going away. But the way that it’s getting bolted into -everything- is likely to eventually subside. It’s been interesting to see companies rebrand around AI even when they don’t actually produce or integrate any of those technologies. That’s driving part of the overvaluation of AI at large. AI and the collection of technologies that get called AI aren’t new. They’re just suddenly in focus and all the rage. We’ve seen this cycle before in technology and we’ll see it again with something else. reply",

The CEO needs to tell the investors that the company is all-in on AI.  At the same time, the CEO needs to tell the engineers to use AI judiciously to support real customer needs, but not go hog-wild with it where it doesn’t make sense. This sort of situation, where you need to tell one group one set of facts to get them to act but another group a different set of facts, is fairly common in business (and politics). The way big corporations handle this is to have many layers of management and a very diffuse set of responsibilities so that nobody is outright “lying”, they’re just interpreting what they’ve been told in a way that makes sense relative to their job responsibilities.  The way startups handle it is to lie and hope that by the time they get caught, their results speak for themselves. reply",

There is no product roadmap for what this looks like, or what features might be involved, or why we'd want to do it from a product point of view. Instead the reason is that this is the only way to attract a big series C round. This is not a thing a company does when they have good enough growth. Adequate revenue growth when you need a series C must be very good growth. Adequate growth when you'e profitable is a very different thing. > Instead of working on useful, in-demand product features, it feels like we're spending a lot of time looking at a distant future that we'll struggle to reach if we take our eye off of the ball. Is this normal? Yes, very normal. If I'm you, I'm wondering if there's really product/market fit. Useful, in demand product features almost don't matter. Building more does not make more money happen. But also, the AI stuff is disruptive. In a way that the internet was. I think what you should probably judge most strongly here is if there is ANYONE with influence that has a take on how that looks for your company. That take probably includes \"how this makes a lot of what we do irrelevant\". Absent that, I'd just write the company off. If you like the job great.

I'm not opposed to using this tech at all – it's amazing, and we incorporate a variety of different ML models across our stack where they are useful. But this strategy has evolved to the point where we are limiting resource on key teams aligned with core business to invest in an AI team. This may or may not be bad. If done right, the majority of the new features will be AI related while the core team will do non-AI enhancements and bug fixes. If they aren't worked to death, the main product will remain stable, just with shifting priority to AI related features over regular features. Maybe 60/40 AI features, shifting to 70/30 over time, etc. Eventually you'll run out of AI ideas or tech. Having said that, might as well get on the train, AI is a desired skill now so like anything, it'll keep you relevant for a while. reply",

If you want more oomph than that, you can find dedicated server offers at those three places, starting around maybe $30/month. Typically pretty old systems, but I enjoy having a whole ancient box rather than one core in a vm on a modern box. My personal hosting needs are tiny though, so I could fit back into the VPS if money were an issue. reply",

Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

          "text": "As someone who did a lot of hiring in my last job, I would push back against the narrative here that it's about lying or behavior policing. Although there is plenty of truth that there's an unfair bias against negativity, I do think there's a very valid reason for hiring managers to care about whether or not an applicant can remain positive or at least objectively neutral in an interview, and be diplomatic about negative experiences. Invariably, at any company, even if they are a fantastic workplace, you are going to disagree with your lead or coworkers at some point. You will be asked to do work you aren't excited about or don't see value in, and you will be asked to work with people you don't particularly like. If you aren't able to maintain a fairly positive attitude for a one hour interview, it makes sense that a hiring manager might worry about how well you'll be able to be a team player when things get rough. I used to think it was bullshit, and I learned the hard way. I hired someone who was fairly unpleasant during his interview, because he was the most competent applicant, and it seemed wrong to me to look at anything other than job skills. He was an excellent programmer, but he sucked so much time and energy out from the rest of the team with complaints and arguments. Of course I don't think that's always going to be the case, sometimes people have gone through genuinely negative past work experiences or just have brusque personalities, but I was certainly wary after that of people who couldn't put on a positive attitude for an interview. reply",

Let’s take your example - boss has an affair with a coworker, you speak up about it, then you get the boot and sign an NDA. In that scenario, I’d probably say something like the following: “There was an interpersonal incident that was out of my control, and unfortunately I’m not legally allowed to speak about it in detail. What I can say is that I learned how important it is to stand up for what’s right even if it comes at a personal cost.” This isn’t playing a game, it’s having empathy for the person sitting across the table from you. They have to make a decision on very limited information, and you’re trying to help them make that decision. If I were to just say “hehe let’s just say that something crazy went down, and I’m out of a job.” Well technically I told the truth, but I certainly didn’t help the interviewer make their assessment. reply",

Your coworker wasn't an asshole. He was an assertive person with a different perspective than yours, and you worked to find common ground so that you could succeed despite your competing visions. Bonus points if you can internalize this mindset and start seeing said assholes as people you merely impersonally disagree with. This makes life much happier. Don’t lean into the negative.

Get it out of your system -- talk to a friend that gets how annoying that was and vent until you're tired of talking about it. Get heard and you'll feel like the negativity is finally behind you. 2) Think about the opportunities that your previous job gave you. Specifically opportunities. Every time a negative thought comes up, ask \"What was my opportunity at that moment?\" and write down your answer. Opportunity to disagree and commit? Great. Opportunity to solidify your understanding of your own values? Great! Opportunity to challenge yourself and work on something outside of your comfort zone? etc. Write those down and brag about them to your next amazing job! reply",

          "text": "when i interviewed candidates for software engineering roles in $non-tech-megacorp i was primarily interested in how folks did in the problem solving / coding / API design interviews. but, we also asked some behavioural questions about past experiences.  we don't say it explicitly, but we're looking for responses like --- can you say some words that suggest you have demonstrated initiative at work, or you can sometimes influence others and build support for a decision rather than unilaterally doing stuff without consultation (we're $megacorp, not $startup...) .  you don't need to be able to talk at length about all aspects of your past job, but you do need to be able to offer a few examples of That Time When I Demonstrated Initiative, or That Time When I Influenced The Stakeholders that can be mashed into a digestible Situation / Task / (your) Action / Result format & where you can give a few reasonable answers to follow up questions from interviewers who probe and ask annoying questions like \"so, what exactly were your responsibilities?\" another thing we'd be probing for is \"growth mindset\" type stuff. a bad response to \"if you were in a similar situation in future, what would you do differently?\" is \"nothing, everything i did at $oldjob was optimal\". a response that shows some reflection, a willingness to admit not everything you do is perfect, and concrete ideas for improvements to behaviour or process comes across much better. no need to enumerate all your worst failings, cherry-pick and offer one or two lesser ones. for these kinds of behavioural questions based on past experience, we didn't really care if junior / intermediate hires struggled to give strong responses. We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

That’s the time to be more honest about unrealistic deadlines. But even then I’m going to ask a follow up question about what did you do to try to influence change.  I don’t think there has ever been a time in my career (29 years, 10 jobs) that I couldn’t have talked to higher ups and negotiate between time, cost and requirements.  I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job. Oh and the third - keep an up to date resume, a constantly updated longer form career document that lists out your major accomplishments in STAR format, an up to date skillset, and a solid network. reply",

I asked if they had the same problem and they assured me that they did not. I also talked about a security breach that defaced our website, but put it in the context of the overall success of our security practice. In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest. After all, it's our perceptions and our attitudes that we can change. An interview is not the place to unload your negative feelings.

My advice: - write down the stories (use cases) before the actual IV\n  - for each story, focus on what you learnt / succeeded\n  - for the really negative ones, focus on the learning\n  - for the other ones, focus on the outcomes, mentioning  things that worked and maybe some things that did not work  and how you did it This is the part where you have to act the game and avoid being too transparent.

And the problem is that for a lot of people those two things seem contradictory, because with interpersonal politics we'll intentionally spin things just slightly, not like a politician but just to maintain a good vibe and keep everyone comfortable and engaged. Like imagine if you were in a social gathering, and there's also a girl you like in there that you're trying to impress, and someone asked you about that previous role, you wouldn't drift off into a rant or anything negative because you don't want to kill the vibes of the meeting, you want to look your best because there's a girl you like there, so maybe you'd say something like \"ah, it just wasn't a good fit\". And if that came up while you were dating that girl you like, and she wanted to dig deeper on it, you wouldn't just repeat the same thing, because it would look like you're being evasive and she would then be on the defensive because she would've felt like she's prying too much, and it would kill the vibe, you'd just say something a little bit more, also keeping it short, and maybe mention something good about working there that you learned, and then not forcefully but try to make some room to move to another subject, or if you can do it slickly without making it feel awkward then you just shift to some other topic that feels engaging without making it look evasive. Again, it's all about maintaining a good vibe. And companies want to know the ins and outs about you, but they also just want to know that you have some social skills in doing stuff like that, because they're running a company with different kinds of people, sometimes from very different backgrounds, and they need the team to work together and feel cohesive. The company and the management are already trying to keep the company afloat and profitable, it's own engineering problem, on top of marketing, on top of operational concerns, they don't want to have concerns around political drama in the office, they want to know that you can be cool. Unless you're a boy genius from Southie, then maybe they'll tolerate a lot of weird shit from you, but you aren't a boy genius from Southie. reply",

          "text": "I have learnt after trying various levels of honesties in interviews that you just don't talk about \"negative\" things as negative things, you talk about negative things disguised/spun as positive things, however much it may disgust you. This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\". [1] Heaven forbid, if you tell them \"you regret not standing up to that manager and not fighting and making a stink\" :) reply",

People who don't have likely never tried anything difficult. But you have to be diplomatic about this. Practice it. Write the answer. Go over it for 20 hours. Treat it like a presentation because it is. I go so far as to make an AI \"interviewer\" in Vapi so I can voice it out, and you can mod the tone to be supportive, indifferent, sarcastic, etc. If you're disappointed with yourself, say that. Humans make mistakes. Someone out there started smoking or drinking once. Someone had an affair. You don't know which of your interviewers did which, but you can assume that everyone has done something they knew was a bad idea. It's also reasonable to assume that an applicant is leaving for reasons. Bored? Wants more money? That's a pretty bad reason. Unhappy? That's a much better reason. What's the catch? Why is this property on the market for cheap? A trick is to imply what people want to hear - you're looking to work with smarter people, better processes, get your shit together, etc. reply",

To me it seems politeness is a mostly self-reinforcing cultural phenomenon that doesn't have any real objective basis. How much of your speech and gestures  you're expected to use for etiquette without it carrying any real semantic meaning varies greatly between different cultures. Countries with a lot of politeness (e.g. Japan) don't seem to be any better at communicating and cooperating than countries with very little (e.g. Finland). If anything I would guess there's a negative correlation. I guess more politeness in a culture makes it easier to be passive-aggressive, if that's something you want. reply",

          "text": "Heh.  The books on the list would be the ones from which I learned new ways to think about programming. Most of them are now long out-of-date, as witness the discussion on \"101 BASIC Games\" going on elsewhere on Hacker News. \"101 Basic Games\", edited by David Ahl and published by DEC.  I learned to program by typing in the code from this book back in the late '70's. \"Write Your Own Programming Language Using C++\", by Norman E. Smith. This is about writing a simple Forth interpreter.  I used what I learned to write a simple Forth interpreter in C, which I then used as an embedded extension language in a couple of apps I was working on at the time.  This was on a VAX, and rather before I'd ever heard of anything like TCL/TK. \"Tcl and the Tk Toolkit\", by John Ousterhout, which (among other things) explained how an embedded extension language ought to work. The O'Reilly X Windows books, and various O'Reilly books with animals on the cover.  They were essential references,  back in the day. \"The C++ FAQs\", by I don't remember who.  I never used C++ much; but this book was an excellent introduction to all of the pitfalls in the C++ of the day, and how to use C++ without shooting yourself in the foot--and an even better example of how to write for programmers.  It was a big influence on how I later wrote programmer's documentation. \"Refactoring\", by Martin Fowler.  I've never followed the advice in this book slavishly, but it's tremendously affirming to read a new book encouraging you to do what you were doing already without having a name for it. \"Effective Java\", by Joshua Bloch, which I spent a lot of time with about ten years ago; it helped me come to grips with Java and avoid a variety of foot-guns, much like \"The C++ FAQs\". Various Lisp books; I don't like Lisp all that much, or Scheme either; but I come back to one or the other every few years and take another look, because I always learn something. Various other texts on specific programming languages, as I experiment with them; \"Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good\" sticks out mostly because it has a memorable title. And \"Crafting Interpreters\", which I've worked all the way through and then run with.  Last month I implemented a simple Datalog implementation in a few days using the techniques from CI; I'll soon be integrating it into a much enhanced version of Nystrom's Lox. reply",

          "text": "Anything that is forward compute only is never ever going to be anywhere close to AI. The LLMs are a dead end. >or simulating the evolution of digital creatures in the wild web. You are on the right track with this thinking. Fundamentally, AI in the actual sense of having intelligence will be something that can run simulations in parallel and pick the winning result, much like genetic algorithms. The rules for the simulation it will obtain from interacting without outside world, and the map of input to output will be stored in a LLM like structure as memory. The big question is how do you build it.  Imagine its running on a hardware,  with a UART card that is hooked up to a network cable. It should eventually be able to figure out how go on the internet simply by setting 1s and zeros in the right places at the right time, how to host a server and build an interface that a person can connect to and talk to it for more information (if it decides that this is even necessary), and so on. I don't think an objective function that it can minimize/maximize is really applicable, so by extension I don't think we can get to this AI agent through traditional training, the process to make this algorithm has to mimic evolution. I.e we basically create some ambiguous structure of a neural net with a clock and recursive connections, and then start doing something like a genetic algorithm, with a fitness function of being able to figure more shit out. Obviously this will take exponentially more compute than the world has currently for running LLMS. reply",

[1] They can adjust auction parameters for owned properties to juice CPCs, blend ads to drive CTR and disable functionality of ad-blockers in tranches to squeeze as much growth as needed. Search quality has seemed awful for quite some time [2], but all that really matters is growth for ad ePM-- driven by CTR and CPC. The leaked documents from last year also had comments about correlations between lower search quality and higher ad click rates, so there is that, too. Youtube also increases ad load. More ads per video, combined with organic growth, higher engagement and wider distribution (smart TVs probably have insane metrics-- plus no real ad blockers there, either) mean they'll keep having display/video ads doing extremely well, too.

Automated testing only counts as one test because it does the same test over and over... it is a solid practice, but it is a safety net against regressions, it is not actually putting the software through new environments, scenarios, and usage. But get that software out in the field, grow its userbase, run it for years, and you have thousands if not millions of different uses of it. Take all the bugs that come out of that, fix them, and you have software that is less buggy. So sure, inexperienced teams put out bugs. I do, too... more than I should. Hopefully the egregious one's where it simply does not work never get to production. But the more nuanced bugs and their eventual fixes come from the software running in the wild. So if you are the pilot user for new products, you will see all those early bugs. reply",

The argument for the vibe coding side could be that best developers are able to write better prompts.

Releasing software was expensive, you had to put it on physical media and ship it. QA was critical role, it was way less expensive to test the hell out it and fix it than it was to ship new code. The idea that computers could be trusted to perform tasks well was easily shattered when things went wrong, and the additional optics of losing customer trust went a long way into driving QA. Fast forward to today, and it's way cheaper to ship code with bugs to prove out an idea works than it is to spend even a few minutes writing test cases and doing even a modicum of QA. Ultimately, it's a not just a combination of all 3 things you've mentioned, which are all contributing factors; the real problem is any level of QA before proving an idea is seen as a waste of time and money. As someone who started in tech support & QA 30 years ago, it's really tough to see. reply",

Regarding context windows, Gemini currently offers 1M tokens (reportedly increasing to 2M soon), GPT-4.1 also handles a large window of 1m tokens, and Claude provides 200k. \nIn my experience testing them with large code files (around 3-4k lines), I found Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.7 Sonnet performed quite similarly, both handling the large context well and providing good solutions. However, my impression was that GPT-4.1 didn't perform quite as well, While GPT-4.1 is certainly capable, I feel Gemini has a slight edge in this area right now. Based on this, I'd lean towards using Gemini 2.5 Pro for extremely large contexts needing high-quality results, GPT-4.1 for backend logic, and found Claude 3.7 particularly effective for UI interface tasks. reply",

And I've recently been using Q-cli, which was extremely easy to get integrated into my Neovim/Tmux workflow. Purely from a code quality perspective, they're all about the same, and they all generate code that rarely works for the first time. At least from my experience, and highly depending on language. For instance, Q-cli with Rust seems to generate better output for me than Gemini with Rust. And ChatGPT with JS gives me way better code than Claude with JS. I honestly think that currently in the market, it's not really a choice of which is better, but which is the right tool for workflow and language. reply",

          "text": "\"Tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This works against _the LLM proper,_ but not against chat applications with integrated search. For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

You ask them to build a flying submarine and by God they'll build one, dammit! They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done?

ChatGpt: Short answer: No single path mask can do that. Here's why: (very long answer) Me: are you sure I can't use greater than, less than in the masks? ChatGpt: Yes — **I am absolutely sure:** **Grasshopper path masks do *NOT* support greater-than or less-than comparisons.** Official sources and detailed confirmation: (sources and stuff) ...so I think your priors may need to be updated, at least as far as \"never\".

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

          "text": "That's a fair point. What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"? I say this with only hobbyist understanding of neural science topics mind you. reply",

Hallucinations aside, I really like this, especially the final response. Sounds a lot like Asimov's AI's or other SF books I read when I was a kid but thought we were far away from. Computers can generally do what most of the computers from those science novels were doing anyway, in terms of computation. Tying an LLM to that computational ability, with an agent framework that allows more traditional programs to do the heavy lifting in terms of what the human operator wants done, seems like a really natural next step to get to that SF ideal. reply",

The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

Take coding as an example, if you're a programmer you can spot the bullshit (i.e. made up libraries), and rephrasing can result in entire code being written, which can be an immense time saver.

There's no way to tell that it has a wrong answer - aside from looking for the answer elsewhere which defeats its purpose. It'd be like using a chainsaw all day and not knowing how much wood you cut, or if it just stopped working in the middle of the day.

          "text": "I don’t understand what the issue is… here’s a couple outputs from my ChatGPT: Marathon Crater can refer to a couple of things depending on context—space science or Earth geology—but the most common reference is to Marathon Crater on Mars, a site of interest in planetary science and exploration. Here’s a breakdown: ⸻ 1. Marathon Crater (Mars) Location:\n • Found in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars.\n • Named after the location where NASA’s Opportunity rover completed a “marathon” (42.2 kilometers or 26.2 miles) of travel on the Martian surface in March 2015. Significance:\n • Notable because it marks a milestone in robotic planetary exploration—the first human-made object to travel a marathon distance on another planet.\n • The crater itself is relatively shallow and small (just a few meters in diameter), but geologically interesting for its ejecta (material thrown out during the impact that formed it), which may offer insights into subsurface composition. Scientific Observations:\n • Opportunity studied the rocks and soil around the crater, focusing on clay minerals and hematite-bearing formations.\n • The region helps scientists understand the planet’s wetter past and sedimentary history. ⸻ 2. Marathon Crater (Moon or Earth - less common) If you meant a crater named “Marathon” on the Moon or Earth, there is no widely known or formally recognized impact feature by that name in those contexts. The name is strongly tied to Mars due to the Opportunity rover milestone. ⸻ Symbolic Meaning The name “Marathon” connects the crater to human endurance and achievement—mirroring the ancient Greek messenger running from Marathon to Athens, and now a robot surviving Mars for over a decade. ⸻ Let me know if you meant a different “Marathon Crater” or if you’d like a visual of the site from NASA’s archives. _______ Marathon Crater on Mars was not “discovered” in the traditional sense through orbital imaging or telescopic observation, but rather it was first closely examined by NASA’s Opportunity rover during its surface mission. Timeline of Discovery & Naming:\n • March 24, 2015 – NASA’s Opportunity rover reached the site and marked its 26.2-mile milestone (the length of a marathon).\n • The small crater, about 27 meters (88 feet) in diameter, was named “Marathon Valley” (encompassing the broader area) and “Marathon Crater” to commemorate this achievement.\n • The naming is informal and symbolic, coined by the mission team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), not through official IAU designation. Context\n • The Marathon Crater itself was identified from orbital data (likely by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), but it gained its name and significance once Opportunity physically reached it.\n • Thus, while orbital images may have shown it earlier, its “discovery” as a point of scientific interest occurred on March 24, 2015—when the rover arrived and the naming was announced. Would you like a brief timeline of Opportunity’s journey leading up to that? reply",

I've also seen teams go for AI, f it up, and all get fired as the company shuts down. The question is whether the key value of your product can benefit from the strengths of AI? If not, don't go there. If so, you then need to determine if your team can actually deliver an AI-driven vision that enhances the existing value prop. Again, if not, don't go there. If so, do it. But from your description, your CEO is not asking those questions - they are asking, \"How do we get more funding?\" Which tells me that your CEO doesn't give a crap about building a product, they are just trying to make money and get some nice bullet points on their resume about the size of a company they led. That puts you in the position of choosing whether you want to go on a VC-driven startup ride just to have the experience, or whether you want a product-driven role. People have their reasons for both directions, but if you want a product-driven role, you are out of alignment with your CEO and probably shouldn't work for them. reply",

          "text": "Exactly. Tech has become a place where “funding” has become synonymous with “find a VC to fund you”. Most businesses don’t go that route, and plenty of tech ones don’t either. Savings, bank loans, lines of credit, private loans between people, local angel investors, and so on are how most businesses bootstrap. I co-own a technology business that has never taken outside money (well, we do have a credit card) and I’m not really interested in doing that. I think VCs are more trouble than they’re worth because they’re so obsessed with growth that little else matters to them, and we’ve seen where that gets us in terms of customer relationships and product quality. And they always want just enough control to eventually oust executives they don’t agree with. We’ve built our business up the old fashioned way: from a personal capital contribution from each co-founder and modeling pricing based on what the business needs. Clients who see value in that approach from their critical technology vendors are not impossible to find at all. Without the runway of functionally blank checks, you do have to continually monitor your business model though. reply",

          "text": "Your qualifying statement is found some heavy lifting. First 'tech company' is a very narrow band. There are lots of companies that were founded to leverage technology, but which do not consider themselves 'tech' companies.  We're, for example a services business, the service we provide happens to use tech we developed. Second \"of note\" is very subjective. Do you mean billions of users? Global brand name? Thousands of workers? Because those are very high capital outcomes achieved either via long time (IBM?) or massive capital injection (which leads to very financial motivations.) Of course there are zillions of my smaller 'less notable' businesses that exist all around you and me. You've never heard of the company I work for, but we're well known in our domain in our market. We've never taken outside investment, and we're free to make a lot of 'discretionary spending' that often serves a purpose other than increasing dividends. For example we pay low-end workers (non techies) substantially more than market rate (aka minimum wage) because we belive in 'living wage' principles. That directly reduces profits, which we can do because the owners care about many things, and money is just one of them. Of course the business has to be a business. Of course it has to make money. But money is like blood. You need it to live, but you don't live to make blood. reply",

          "text": "This approach looks to me like a classic mistake of assuming all your potential paying users both are and want to be (these are different things!) power users. Similarly it might be suffering from the problem of living on the cutting edge and assuming everyone else is too. I like the post and what it goes over. I agree with huge swaths of it, especially the misuse of ai tools right now. I don't agree that anyone doing it that way (like the gmail team called out over and over here) is either stupid or naive. I don't agree every consumer tool should become an agent building playground. I don't agree building said playgrounds are easy (I think it's much much harder to design a good agent building version of a product than a good product). I don't agree consumers want everything they use to work this way. I also think it ignores the very real problem of ai bullshitting and the handcuffs that puts on people using it for mission critical things like paying the mortgage. Ironically I think this post falls into its own trap of not thinking about the next step. Yeah a really good email agent product as demod sounds great in a world where nothing works this way yet. However, a world where every product I use has to be re-engineered from scratch, with various unknown and non-customizable (and enshittifying) LLMs under it, with various training and fine tuning, unknown access to data, and no interop is the wood-frame horseless carriage the author is mocking. That would be a terrible situation worse than the current one. Rethinking for a world of ai agents, it would be better if products empowered consumer agents instead of tried to supplant them. In THAT world products stay simple and just expose a bunch of tools and patterns that each consumer's custom agents can effectively use. Making that work well for your own product is actually viable AND helpful AND doesn't force your users to change their behavior if they don't want to. Anything I, the consumer, do to handle or prompt my own agent pays off across my entire ecosystem and investment can be focused on the right things by the right people (ie gmail should make email tools not agent tools). reply",

          "text": "Not OP, but what typically happens: a large contraction. Investors are already contracting the over-investment in AI because it’s so hard to turn an ROI. Satya Nadella was recently on the record as saying he doesn’t think AI has proven a sustainable ROI yet, and that it needs to in order to sustain the current levels of investment. As a matter of cause and effect he is of course right. But no one can predict the timelines and outcomes with exactitude. Tomorrow Nvidia could be seized by a regulator and frozen, decimating the GPU market. SoftBank could decide they’re going all in on some new thing instead. (Incredible examples, of course.) Personally I don’t think AI/LLMs/et al are going away. But the way that it’s getting bolted into -everything- is likely to eventually subside. It’s been interesting to see companies rebrand around AI even when they don’t actually produce or integrate any of those technologies. That’s driving part of the overvaluation of AI at large. AI and the collection of technologies that get called AI aren’t new. They’re just suddenly in focus and all the rage. We’ve seen this cycle before in technology and we’ll see it again with something else. reply",

This sort of situation, where you need to tell one group one set of facts to get them to act but another group a different set of facts, is fairly common in business (and politics). The way big corporations handle this is to have many layers of management and a very diffuse set of responsibilities so that nobody is outright “lying”, they’re just interpreting what they’ve been told in a way that makes sense relative to their job responsibilities.

Good progress on revenue targets from _your_ perspective sounds like not great growth, but communicated softly. > The argument seems to be that they've realized the only way to achieve the next round of funding is to be \"AI-first\". There is no product roadmap for what this looks like, or what features might be involved, or why we'd want to do it from a product point of view. Instead the reason is that this is the only way to attract a big series C round. This is not a thing a company does when they have good enough growth. Adequate revenue growth when you need a series C must be very good growth. Adequate growth when you'e profitable is a very different thing. > Instead of working on useful, in-demand product features, it feels like we're spending a lot of time looking at a distant future that we'll struggle to reach if we take our eye off of the ball. Is this normal? Yes, very normal. If I'm you, I'm wondering if there's really product/market fit. Useful, in demand product features almost don't matter. Building more does not make more money happen. But also, the AI stuff is disruptive. In a way that the internet was. I think what you should probably judge most strongly here is if there is ANYONE with influence that has a take on how that looks for your company. That take probably includes \"how this makes a lot of what we do irrelevant\". Absent that, I'd just write the company off. If you like the job great.

          "text": "When you realise your start up isn’t working, the smartest thing you can do is either sell it to someone who has the resources to do perhaps what you cannot to make it a viable product or service, or give up and move on to something new. To persist endlessly in something that isn’t going to do anything but drain your resources financially and emotionally, is a much bigger failure in the long run. What do you have to lose if you persist with this start up that’s going nowhere vs, what do you have to lose if you just cut your losses now? Honestly, most start ups actually fail. It’s a part of the process. People always think their start up will be the one that doesn’t fail, but it’s because humans are inherently over-optimistic about their businesses. They always think they’ll have them established more quickly, for much less money and work than it actually takes. Take the lessons you’ve learned from this try, and try and apply them to a new idea or start up. If it makes you feel better, I too started a business last year. However, I knew it would likely fail, but I still wanted to give it a go to see if it would work for my lifestyle and I was using it predominantly as a tax deduction anyway. After about 6 months however, I realised my business model was quite frankly not sustainable for the long term and was probably going to cost me more than I had to gain from persisting. Thus, I applied for a job somewhere, and I am in the process of shutting my business down. Does that mean I’m done with trying new things? No. It just means, I’ll do things differently next time.\nFor now, I’m taking the time to ‘recover’ from the burnout, and I’m thinking about new ideas for things I can try later down the track when I’m ready to go again. reply",

          "text": "Hey, I really hear the weight of what you're going through. Losing your father and then trying to navigate the brutal startup world on the West Coast with limited resources sounds incredibly tough, and the numbness you describe is a very real response to that kind of sustained pressure and grief. It's easy for advice to sound like clichés, especially \"talk to customers,\" but the struggle you're having to even find those conversations highlights a core challenge. Building a network, especially as an introvert, takes time and intentional effort. LinkedIn can be a numbers game, and a 3% response rate, while not zero, can feel disheartening when you're up against the clock. Considering where you are financially and emotionally, and being honest about the traction so far, it might be worth seriously considering hardwaresofton's suggestion to put the startup on the back burner for now and find some stability with a contract or full-time role. This wouldn't be giving up on your tech experience or your entrepreneurial spirit, but rather hitting pause to address your immediate needs. That steady income could provide the breathing room to process your grief, recharge, and then revisit your startup with fresh eyes and a more stable foundation, or even pivot to a new idea with the lessons learned. Think of it as gathering resources – both financial and emotional – for your next chapter, whatever that may be. The decade you've spent in tech is valuable, and finding a role that utilizes those skills while providing security could be a powerful step forward right now. It's okay to feel lost and burned out. It's a natural reaction to what you've been through. Taking some pressure off yourself to \"make it work\" right now might actually be the most strategic move you can make for your long-term well-being and future success. reply",

Programming a system in its most basic sense is pretty easy, while structuring it so it's understandable and easy to maintain is a whole 'nother story. If you need a great example of what happens when you don't have that... well, look at any 'vibe coded' product going viral on social media. The creators have no idea what their tools are doing and no plan for anything going forward, so are drowning under a pile of auto generated code they have zero understanding of. Feels like software security knowledge will probably remain relevant for a while too. It's all well and good getting an LLM to code the system, but without any idea of what exploits are being used against that language/framework/software as  a whole, you're almost certainly going to get hacked at some point or another. But to be honest, I'd also programming in general will still matter in 10 years, especially for more niche domains. Yes, stuff like Claude can throw together apps and programs in JavaScript or PHP or Python, but they don't have training material for every language or domain.

          "text": ">> Anyone can do programming. That's not really that impressive. You're completely right, but just because anyone can doesn't mean it's unimpressive. (It does make it 'not valuable'). It's like cooking. Anyone can do it. Lots of people do. Some (maybe the majority if you include men and children) never learned how. A home cook can be exceptional but apart from the obvious (feeding the family) it's a skill that is hard learned with little value. Of course frozen meals were designed to replace home cooking decades ago (hint; that never happened. ) And just because people can cook, doesn't mean they can (or should) open a restaurant. (The restaurant business is only lightly dependent on cooking.) The analogy holds in programming. A good programmer is impressive for getting on the ladder. But making it in the software world requires lots of non-programing skills. Put another way, yes programing is impressive (looking from below) but is only one step on a tall ladder. As you say, there's design, development, architecture, documentation, communication, refinement - all critical to a product's ultimate success. AI is on the first rung of the ladder. And in many ways thats a very impressive step. And maybe it'll climb a bit higher. But looking down, it has a long long way to go before it replaces me :) reply",

AI knows all the term, use the language. AI is also amazing with stuff like DDD, and I find that when working on some creative work, I might ask it to just break down a concept into ubiquitous language and such. And let's say AI does all the programming for us, but engineers are there to know what can be programmed and what couldn't.

We would need to tell a society with ubiquitous exoskeletons to mindfully exercise their body so it does not atrophy. The exercise you would get hiking will never translate to core body strength with the exoskeleton on. Likewise, core body strength would only have ambiguous value since everything would be done with an exoskeleton regardless since it's simply better. For programming specifically, you can already see it with Leetcode. Which of the Leetcode problems really matter and why for most work? Few for most us, but whoever is deciding what is important will decide what it is important. Google for example decides which Leetcode problems are important and they will decide in the future in the same way. It will have nothing to do with the reality of the day to day.

          "text": "You can easily get a VPS for around $5/month from quality vendors. You can probably find a lot of offers around $1/month for a VPS on lowendbox, lowendtalk, and webhostingtalk. If you want more oomph than that, you can find dedicated server offers at those three places, starting around maybe $30/month. Typically pretty old systems, but I enjoy having a whole ancient box rather than one core in a vm on a modern box. My personal hosting needs are tiny though, so I could fit back into the VPS if money were an issue. reply",

There are a few different programs that you could qualify for. There is also the Techsoup organization, which helps nonprofits and charities with technology needs: https://page.techsoup.org/amazon-web-services-for-nonprofits I would highly recommend looking through there for not just AWS specific tools & services, but a wide variety of solutions that might help this charity.

To me it seems politeness is a mostly self-reinforcing cultural phenomenon that doesn't have any real objective basis. How much of your speech and gestures  you're expected to use for etiquette without it carrying any real semantic meaning varies greatly between different cultures. Countries with a lot of politeness (e.g. Japan) don't seem to be any better at communicating and cooperating than countries with very little (e.g. Finland). If anything I would guess there's a negative correlation. I guess more politeness in a culture makes it easier to be passive-aggressive, if that's something you want. reply",
