          "text": "An interview is a sales pitch for a product. The product just happens to be you. Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

I once had a candidate say something like “yeah and that job didn’t end very nicely…I’ll just leave it at that.” This is not a good thing to say in a job interview. 3.

          "text": "Why are you leaving your current job questions are typically inartful checks whether there's \"something wrong with you.\" Refusing to meaningfully answer can come across as, \"I'd prefer not to discuss whether there's something wrong with me.\" Not explicitly damaging, but certainly not confidence building. The most useful answers I've heard in the wild were dispassionate, one sentence expressions of why <objective fact> made the existing job irreconcilable with your <valid need>. Done well, that shows the hiring manager you're able to approach conflict constructively, and gives reason to believe the bad fit is unlikely to recur in this role. AskAManager[0] also suggests \"I’m not actively looking, but I saw this job and was really interested because of X,\" as a reasonably broad spectrum solution to this problem. (Though after just a year, I as a hiring manager might still worry you are flighty). [0] https://www.askamanager.org/2023/02/how-do-i-tell-interviewe... reply",

          "text": "In an interview setting you should frame negatives as growth. You are doing marketing, not a retrospective or post mortem so put on the LinkedIn-style, vacuously-half-a-person mask. The interviewers know their job isn't perfect so a valuable thing to evaluate is \"can this person keep a positive and effective attitude through both good and bad\". Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest.

We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

          "text": "I have learnt after trying various levels of honesties in interviews that you just don't talk about \"negative\" things as negative things, you talk about negative things disguised/spun as positive things, however much it may disgust you. This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\". [1] Heaven forbid, if you tell them \"you regret not standing up to that manager and not fighting and making a stink\" :) reply",

I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job. Oh and the third - keep an up to date resume, a constantly updated longer form career document that lists out your major accomplishments in STAR format, an up to date skillset, and a solid network. reply",

Just typical average normal shit that every fucking normal semi-competent person does when applying for a job. What you want to do is publicly shit on your previous employer and still get another job. That's not too smart, now is it? Every company that's looking for people to hire can see exactly how you're going to treat that company once you've moved on and no longer work there. Everybody has issues with their previous job. The way you deal with it is you discuss those issues with your self-help group at the local bar. When you're in an interview, every single thing in your work history was great. The people that you worked with were great. The companies that you worked with were great. Everything was fucking excellent. Just totally fucking excellent. Brilliant. When people hear, \"It's a period of my life where I was mostly unhappy\", that's a guy they don't want to go to work every day and work with. At least I don't. I got my own problems. I fucking want to retire tomorrow at the latest. I don't fucking want to go in to work tomorrow. I really don't. I might call in sick. Easter Bird Flu or some completely made up shit. You think that's what I tell them? I tell them everything is going great. Everything is fucking excellent. I'm probably going to work tomorrow. reply",

          "text": "Part of the reason bit torrent works really well is that the file is downloaded in random order. It lets everyone cooperate, while still being robust to bad peers, bad network connections, churn etc. If you want live high quality streaming, a lot of reasons bit torrent works so well goes away. Latency matters. In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. In bit torrent, everyone can divide the work - clients try to download the part of the file the least number of people have, quickly rare parts of the file spread everywhere. In streaming everyone needs the same piece at the same time. Bit torrent punishes people who dont contribute by deprioritizing sending stuff to peers that freeride. It can do this on the individual level. In a p2p streaming setup, you probably have some peers getting the feed, and then sending it to other peers. The relationship isnt reciperocal so its harder to punish freeriders as you can't at the local level know if the peer you are sending data to is pushing data to the other nodes it is supposed to or not. I'm sure some of these have work arounds, but they are hard problems that aren't really satisfactorily solved reply",

In bit torrent if the peer goes away, no big deal, just try again in 5 minutes with another peer, you are downloading in random order, who cares if one piecs is delayed 5 minutes. In a live stream your app is broken if it cuts out for 5 minutes. First of all, BitTorrent clients do not download in random order or wait 5 minutes. They usually download the rarest block first, but can do whatever they want, whenever they want. Second, standard HLS sets a nominal segment size of 6 seconds (some implementations will go as high as 10 seconds), and a client will usually cache multiple segments before playing (e.g., 3). This mean that you have 18 seconds before a segment becomes critical. This is not a difficult thing for a P2P network to handle. You'd adapt things to introduce timing information and manage number of hops, but each client can maintain a connection to a number of other clients and have sufficient capacity to fill a segment if a connection fails. Various strategies could be used to distribute load while avoiding latency penalties. Low-latency HLS uses much smaller segments and would be more demanding, but isn't impossible to manage. > BitTorrent punishes people who dont contribute Private communities punish this behavior, BitTorrent clients do not. Most new downloads will appear as freeriders for a long time, and only over long periods far exceeding the download time will enough compatible seeding opportunities arise for them to contribute in any substantial way. The network does not need everyone to seed, it only needs enough people to seed. reply",

The only way to be a seed these days is to get the release microseconds after it gets released, and download it before everyone else gets their hands on it, so you can upload to them. Everyone else then has to download from you, but since everyone that's more than slightly involved has a seedbox with symmetric gigabit, the issue of leeches just isn't the same as it was before in the dial up and DSL era. That the culture hasn't been able to evolve past that, and hangs on to such outdated notions is disappointing. I'm not saying people shouldn't be incentivized to give back. Leeches suck. But in this land of plenty, theres this problem of being unable to seed because there's just too many seeders trying to seed. reply",

The server can control the stream by advertising a customized manifest to individual clients, although it's a bit silly. HLS is designed to be extremely easy to load distribute and throw CDN/cache proxies in front, and it's a bad sad that content providers are this bad at load management. :/ Either way, the assumption here is that you would swap out the client doing HLS with a client designed to use a P2P protocol, including the seeding portion and network health management. reply",

Most of what you are saying isn't accurate for netflix style streaming, which would actually be more aptly called \"video on demand\", but is very applicable to \"live streaming\" in the sense of live sporting events or news broadcasts. Video-on-demand is perfectly implementable on top of BitTorrent. As you say, there are some latency pitfalls you'll have to avoid, but that's nothing you can't hack yourself out of. Livestreaming is a different beast. As you say, the problem with livestreaming is that everyone needs the same content at the same time. If I spend 200ms downloading the next 500ms worth of content, then there's nobody to share it with, they all spent the 200ms doing the same. BitTorrent relies on the time shift that is allowed between me downloading the content and you requesting it. If you request it before I've got it, well I can't fulfil that request, only the guy I intend to get it from can. If you wanted to implement something like that, you would probably pick a tree of seeders where the protocol would pick a subset of trusted nodes that it would upload the content to before then allowing them to seed it, and the have them doing the same recursively. That would obviously introduce a bunch of complexity and latency, and would very much not be BitTorrent anymore. reply",

For example, say you have a cluster of people on the call in the US and another cluster in the UK. Ping times are 100ms or more across the ocean, there will be some random packets lost, but ping times within the UK are around 15ms max. By working co-operatively and sharing among themselves the clients in one cluster can fill in missing packets from a different cluster far quicker than the requesting them from the originating host. In general, the ability to request missing packets from a more local source should be able to improve overall video call quality. It still might be \"too late\", because for minimal latency, you might choose to use packets as soon as they arrive and maybe even treat out-of-order packets as missing, and just display a blockier video instead, but if the clients can tolerate a little more latency (maybe a tunable setting, like 50ms more than the best case) then it should in theory work better than current systems. I've been mulling over some of these ideas myself in the past, but it's never been high enough on my TODO list to try anything out. reply",

That's only true if you assume the nodes operate sequentially, which is not given. If the nodes operate independently from one another (which they would, being non-cooperating) they'd all get a response in ~100ms (computation and signaling time is negligible here), which is faster than they could get it cooperatively, even if we assume perfect cooperation (100ms for the first local node + 15ms from there). It's parallelism. Doing less work might seem theoretically nice, but if you have the capacity to do the same work twice simultaneously you avoid the synchronization. Basically, it falls somewhere in my loose \"tree based system\" sketch. In this case the \"trusted\" nodes would be picked based on ping time clustering, but the basic sketch that you pick a subset of nodes to be your local nodes and then let that structure recursively play out is the same. The problem you run into is latency. There's no good way to pick a global latency figure for the whole network, since it varies by how deep into the tree you are. As the tree grows deeper, you end up having to retune the delay. The only other option is to grow in width at which point you've just created a another linear growth problem, albeit with a lower slope. reply",

You should understand my argument more as a sketch of proof. That being said I have a small correction. If you want to stream to two peers (that is you have a network with 3 fully connected nodes, one being the originator of the stream) and the link latency for all links is 20ms, then your lowest latency path to each node is exactly 20ms, as the originating node could simply send the content to each client. The unfortunate realization is that 20ms is then also the optimal stream delay, assuming you care about the shortest possible latency for your live streaming service. The clients will therefore end up with the content exactly when they were supposed to show it, and therefore they would have no time to forward it to anyone else, lest that downstream would get the content AFTER they were supposed to show it. reply",

          "text": "For a while, I was CTO of a company called Livestation [0], which as the Wikipedia article states, was \"originally based on peer-to-peer technology acquired from Microsoft Research\". This P2P stack was meant to allow for mass scaling of lowish latency video streaming, even in parts of the World with limited peer bandwidth to original content source servers. The VC-1 format got into a legal quagmire, as most video streaming protocols do, and it speaks volumes that by the time I turned up in ~2012-ish, the entire stack was RTMP, RTSP, HDS and HLS with zero evidence of that P2P tech stack in production. My main role was to get the ingest stack out of a DC and into cloud, while also dealing with a myriad of poor design decisions that led to issues (yes, that 2013 outage in the first paragraph of the wiki article was on my watch). At no point did anybody suggest to me that what we really needed to fix our attention back to was P2P streaming, beyond the fact the company built a version of Periscope (Twitter's first live streaming product), and launched it weeks/months before they did, and were pivoting towards a social media platform, at which point I decided to go do other things. The technical and legal problems are real, and covered elsewhere here. People want reliable delivery. Even Spotify, YouTube and others who have licensed content and could save a pile by moving to DRM-ified P2P don't go near it, and that should tell you something about the challenges. I'd love more widespread adoption of P2P tech, but not convinced we'll ever see it in AV any time soon, unfortunately. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveStation reply",

For 'hobbyists' there is a lot of complexity with setting up your own streaming infrastructure compared to just using YouTube or Twitch. Then for media companies who want to own it, they can just buy their own infra and networking which is outrageously cheap. HE.net advertises 40gbit/sec of transit for $2200/month. I'm oversimplifying this somewhat, you do have issues with cheap transit and probably need backups especially for certain regions. But there isn't much of a middleground between hobbyists and big media cos. For piracy (live sports streams), I've read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Stream being used for this exact purposes FWIW.

It is totally possible to do with BitTorrent and request the blocks in the order that you want but you may not always be able to get them in the order you want. In general people aren't tolerant of lag and spinning circles and other such things when they're trying to watch streaming content. If you're fine with just watching it a little bit later might as well queue it up and left the whole thing down load so it's ready when you're ready. reply",

I think you would probably need something more in the neighbourhood of 10 minutes to really make a difference. If you could make a stable p2p live streaming app with the number of peers all watching the same stream in the hundreds and only 30 seconds latency, i'd consider that pretty amazing. > Also do you think there's any way you can prioritize seeders in such a protocol? like some kind of algorithm that the more you share the more you're prioritized in getting the most up to date packets. If we are talking about a livestream (and not \"netflix\" type streaming) then i don't think seeders are a thing. You can't seed a file that isn't finished being created yet. If you mean more generally punishing free-riders, i think  that is difficult in a live stream as generally data would be coming in from a different set of peers than the peers you are sending data out to, so its difficult (maybe not impossible) to know who is misbehaving. reply",

People with depression will tell you it is 100% depression, while people with anxiety will tell you it is 100% anxiety, and people with burnout will tell you it is 100% burnout. Other people will tell you to go outside, or to eat low carb, or to lift weights. Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

          "text": "Aside from any diagnoses or assessing burnout, I’d suggest thinking about what is actually causing the lack of motivation when you sit down. Working on a business is different from coding, per se. You might lack motivation to work on your business specifically or to generally be figuring out business problems. All coding is not equal — are you coding bug fixes, new features, solutions architecture? These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover.

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! To be clear I'm not resentful and don't have negative feelings towards coding or programming, it's just that it's not worth sacrificing much more than anything else for. If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

          "text": "Behavior change at a group level is often driven by sociological forces that start small and build up over time. I highly recommend the work of Damon Centola. His books “Change: How to Make Big Things Happen” and “How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions” are full of stories that help illustrate the concepts he studies. He’s a legit sociologist whose research points to the value of strong ties to help drive persistent adoption and behavior change (whether societal or in product adoption, it’s all based on the same principles). I would not recommend the works by Jonah Berger that also deal with the same topic, because they are primarily based on marketing observations that are often shallow and misleading. For example, the misinterpretation of the “influencer” phenomenon, whereby he concludes that people who gain a following and become popular online actually help shape behavior. That is often, as we now know, only a fleeting phenomenon more akin to a lottery than anything that drives actual change. When you really study the ways in which big products like say, Twitter, blew up, you see that they started with a small group of people who loved them. By the time the “influencers” picked up, the product already had a dedicated audience that made it feel “safe” for the popular person to promote them. Anyway, I hope you enjoy Centola’s work if you check it out. And good luck! reply",

You have a history of conversations and it was easy to CC the boss if someone didn't cooperate. People no longer spent the whole day replying emails. Or Amazon. Instead of selling everything online, they started with books. Books were annoying to buy and easy to \"ship\". A modern example might be Cursor. People already use VSC. They kept the exact same interface, added a few extra features, and end up selling agents. There's lots of agents out there which are great like Aider, but many are too far from someone's workflow. Most of these are in the form of \"create a channel people use, then sell things down that channel\". reply",

          "text": "As I describe before here https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/heres-how-you-can-stay-ahe... , many roboticists overlook the need for JavaScript in their skill set and tech stack. This is because of the evolution of robotics projects and companies: first you build a prototype and only then do you deploy and scale your fleet. The first part is hard and doesn't require any JS. But the second part is even harder and requires a ton of JS, because without web-tooling you won't be able to operate efficiently. This offers a great opportunity for roboticists to distinguish themselves from others be mastering JS for both the backend (rosnodejs, rclnodejs) and the front-end (React, Transitive Robotics). This sets you apart from both \"regular\" roboticists and from \"pure\" web developers. What I'm trying to say: robotics is a very broad field and your current full-stack skills are needed just as well. And while working on those aspects of the robotics stack you can learn about the rest if you want. But you don't even have to to progress in your career in the robotics industry. If you want to work on something specific, you can try to build a capability (\"full-stack app\") on Transitive, the open-source full-stack framework for robotics we've built that works with any robots, esp. ROS ones: https://github.com/transitiverobotics/transitive . Oh and of course learn ROS along the way. reply",

I think LLM agents might just be the little advantage they need, like guided missiles with GPS. Evolutionary programming is hard though.

When GoDaddy wanted to enter the market, they bought Starfield who already had a root which was widely trusted and crossed that with their own.

If your code solves a specific pain point really well, wrap it in a simple front end or paid API and let people use it. Some possible ideas: Micro SaaS: Turn it into a one-page tool (log parser, file cleaner, PDF transformer) with Stripe and add rate limits. People pay for simplicity. Paid API: Use RapidAPI or Plain.com to expose it. Charge per hit or via metered billing. Maybe even a slackbot for some of these would make sense. Productized utility: Sell it as a $49/month “done-for-you” service to whatever niche audience would benefit (dev teams, SEO people, lawyers, etc). Digital bundle: If it’s CLI or script-based, package it up with a guide or demo on YouTube and sell on Gumroad. You’re not necessarily building a startup, and that’s fine! just something useful enough for strangers to pay for which is more than enough reply",

          "text": "Yeah, never open source your code. There are no benefits to it. I speak from experience. 1. Unless you have business connections and raised funding from people who do, open source wil not help gain any additional adoption or raise awareness of your project. This only worked in the past. 2. Hardly anybody who does happen to use your open source project will pay you. You need massive global exposure just to make a developers' standard salary... I remember for years Evan You who built VueJS was getting like $120k max in sponsorships annually (I think it was Patreon), at the peak... And VueJS was extremely popular at the time and being updated frequently... And companies got something (e.g. exposure) in exchange for the sponsorship. 3. It doesn't matter how good it is. Implementation details don't really matter. If your product is useful, some big tech company will build an inferior alternative but promote it like crazy. Nobody will even know your project exists. It doesn't matter if your product is better for many use cases; people won't know it exists so that fact is irrelevant. 4. At best, some big tech monopoly will use your open source code to train their AI to replace you in the marketplace or drive down your wages. People like Linus, DHH, Matt Mullenweg, Solomon Hykes... Who made millions; are from a different epoch and different place too. Not happening anymore. Don't be fooled. They all had to move to Silicon Valley at some point. It's a big club and you ain't in it. My advice is; if you can't sell it, keep your code and use for yourself and your friends/family. reply",

Okay...so it isn't \"sustainable\". So you stop maintaining it. So what? You made a neat thing. You had fun making it. You shared it with others because you thought it was neat, and maybe someone else found it useful too. That's the happy ending of a happy story.

If OP wants to keep the code to themselves then go ahead, your IP nobody cares. If OP wants to build an actual project to monetize the code that way then go for it.

You spend some time and energy to grow some delicious fruits and vegetables that you and your family enjoy eating. You have extra so you share some with friends and neighbors. You still have way more than you need and you don't want it to go to waste. You contemplate opening a stand to sell to passersby. That's a lot of work so you just put out a box with a sign for anyone to take what they want for free. Some drop by and get what they need and you get an occasional 'thank you' note. Someone leaves a few bucks in a jar for you. It makes you feel good. But not everyone is so well behaved. Kids come by and tip over the box or throw some peaches at your house. Some criticize you that some of your free stuff is not the best quality and demand better service. Then you find out the local grocer is stopping by every day to take it all and sell it in his store. What started out as a good will gesture, turns into a headache. Of course the analogy falls apart a bit when you compare a tangible good like food to easily replicatable digital bits, but it still fits in some ways. reply",

I was proud to contribute even if I didn't capture much of the value I created... Now I feel like all of this structure is exploiting and manipulating me and others psychologically. The level of ethics is so low, it is beyond what I could have imagined. I simply don't get the same feelings as I once did. Working on open source doesn't make me hopeful and feel like part of something, it makes me feel like a naive fool. My comments may sound negative but I'm trying to help others, who may be slightly younger versions of myself, to avoid a lot of pain. This pain doesn't teach you much besides resilience and the gains there become extremely marginal... On the other hand, it doesn't seem very useful career-wise to see things as they are. To succeed, you need to be on the same wavelength of optimism as existing successful people. My worldview is holding me back. Ignorance can be an advantage. reply",

The rest is in debugging the code for all the edge cases, writing docs, examples, training, support etc. In other words the \"work\" part. Minimally you need to do enough so that someone can use the code. The code itself has minimal value, the value is in the using. Then you need to figure out how to reach an audience. Then you need to decide if the user will pay, or maybe it's ad supported. Or maybe donations. Hint: unless you have a large audience this will result in very minimal income. Is all this extra work worth it? You can Open Source it, but frankly its unlikely anyone will find it or use it. It might be an interesting line on your CV, bit again probably of marginal value there. My advice is that if it has little to no value to others, just move on. reply",

However, FOSS, as applied to apps, games & tools is nothing more than tech slavery, which is why nowadays it's championed by FANNG and the Deep State (some countries like Israel and India commercialize FOSS source codes as a matter of statecraft).

          "text": "An interview is a sales pitch for a product. The product just happens to be you. Set aside whatever negative feelings you have about this previous job or the people you worked with there. The interviewers care if you will do their job well and with consistency and professionalism. Your personal feelings are irrelevant as long as you can keep them to yourself, or maybe tell your dog. ANY negativity during a job interview is going to work against you. It is expected that you find a way to spin every situation and every project in some kind of positive light. Even when interviewers ask for weaknesses or about conflict, the “right” answer is to be able to talk about that negative thing in a way that lets your true brilliance shine through. Skilled candidates know how to inject just the right amount of humanity and relatability in an otherwise perfect employee. If you are having trouble separating your feelings from your ability to keep to your talking points, then a good therapist may be able to help you learn better emotional regulation skills. In the future, keep working to proactively manage your career. Keep yourself in roles where you are learning and thriving. When you feel burnout creeping in, deploy strategies to counter it or at least get yourself into a new situation. reply",

You can use the technique of \"mental reservation\". There is always something positive or complimentary that can be said about every bad situation, every horrible supervisor. It is simply a matter for you to examine it dispassionately, extract the good, and frame that nicely without introducing insults or the real negativity and pain that you felt in the moment. If your supervisor overworked you and you were induced to come in for 70-hour weeks and you ultimately burned out with no vacation or weekends, you could say that the management \"was quite dedicated to the company's goals and productivity\". If you considered your coworkers to be slackers and they never seemed to work, \"the company accommodated a wide range of talents, skills and abilities.\" If you never saw your supervisor and had nearly no guidance on projects or tasks, \"the management believed in me and trusted me to do the right thing in nearly every respect.\" These are not lies and you should not lie, because if you go counterfactual, that will be found out. If, on the other hand, they know you had a difficult time and you still found ways to compliment those bastards, then perhaps you will do the same favor for them one day. reply",

Although there is plenty of truth that there's an unfair bias against negativity, I do think there's a very valid reason for hiring managers to care about whether or not an applicant can remain positive or at least objectively neutral in an interview, and be diplomatic about negative experiences. Invariably, at any company, even if they are a fantastic workplace, you are going to disagree with your lead or coworkers at some point. You will be asked to do work you aren't excited about or don't see value in, and you will be asked to work with people you don't particularly like. If you aren't able to maintain a fairly positive attitude for a one hour interview, it makes sense that a hiring manager might worry about how well you'll be able to be a team player when things get rough. I used to think it was bullshit, and I learned the hard way. I hired someone who was fairly unpleasant during his interview, because he was the most competent applicant, and it seemed wrong to me to look at anything other than job skills. He was an excellent programmer, but he sucked so much time and energy out from the rest of the team with complaints and arguments. Of course I don't think that's always going to be the case, sometimes people have gone through genuinely negative past work experiences or just have brusque personalities, but I was certainly wary after that of people who couldn't put on a positive attitude for an interview. reply",

You are doing marketing, not a retrospective or post mortem so put on the LinkedIn-style, vacuously-half-a-person mask. The interviewers know their job isn't perfect so a valuable thing to evaluate is \"can this person keep a positive and effective attitude through both good and bad\". Obviously different roles have different knobs to turn here for the right message (like a generic ic vs a \"wartime manager\"). Some basic examples of describing negative situations: I ended up learning a lot there and I'm a better engineer now because of it. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and you can never nail all of them but we really managed to produce a lot of great work there within some pretty serious constraints. I accomplished a major thing and was learning X on the side so it was a perfect time and opportunity to find an opportunity to learn that more in a real world setting and/with experts. I joined that team with the intent to learn X first hand and, while there is always more to learn, I got enough hands-on, production experience with it that I feel like it's firmly in my toolbox. We had some unexpected changes/setbacks early on that changed our goals but it ended up being kind of a blessing in disguise since it pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an unexpected opportunity to level up my leadership/management/architecture/in-the-weeds skills. reply",

My background in academia colors me but the level of office politics some describe in the private sector genuinely sounds like a middle school drama club at times. I've personally witnessed incredibly talented individuals at FAANG companies get the boot for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with their competence. Think messy personal dynamics, bosses having affairs with coworkers aiming for a position. It makes me wonder about this ingrained necessity for pretense and obfuscation in private sector communication. Why the need to constantly play these games as if acknowledging reality is somehow detrimental? In academia, while not devoid of its own issues, the selection process for students at least attempts to prioritize merit and potential. The idea that some of the most brilliant minds I've encountered might be filtered out by arbitrary corporate \"standards,\" while incapable but politically savvy individuals thrive, seems counterproductive. reply",

Let’s take your example - boss has an affair with a coworker, you speak up about it, then you get the boot and sign an NDA. In that scenario, I’d probably say something like the following: “There was an interpersonal incident that was out of my control, and unfortunately I’m not legally allowed to speak about it in detail. What I can say is that I learned how important it is to stand up for what’s right even if it comes at a personal cost.” This isn’t playing a game, it’s having empathy for the person sitting across the table from you. They have to make a decision on very limited information, and you’re trying to help them make that decision.

We would be a lot more concerned about poor responses to these questions for engineering managers or other positions with a leadership component. having a prepared short form answer to \"why are you applying for a job here\" is also a good idea. if you have friends or acquaintances who regularly interview folks who you can hit up for a favour, you could see if they'd be willing to conduct a mock interview and then give you feedback about things you could improve on. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure how you would handle your specific situation, but my general take on interviews is that the interviewer isn't just screening you, in the sense that they want to know what you did and your skillset and skill level, they're also trying to figure out how well you can navigate interpersonal politics. And the problem is that for a lot of people those two things seem contradictory, because with interpersonal politics we'll intentionally spin things just slightly, not like a politician but just to maintain a good vibe and keep everyone comfortable and engaged. Like imagine if you were in a social gathering, and there's also a girl you like in there that you're trying to impress, and someone asked you about that previous role, you wouldn't drift off into a rant or anything negative because you don't want to kill the vibes of the meeting, you want to look your best because there's a girl you like there, so maybe you'd say something like \"ah, it just wasn't a good fit\". And if that came up while you were dating that girl you like, and she wanted to dig deeper on it, you wouldn't just repeat the same thing, because it would look like you're being evasive and she would then be on the defensive because she would've felt like she's prying too much, and it would kill the vibe, you'd just say something a little bit more, also keeping it short, and maybe mention something good about working there that you learned, and then not forcefully but try to make some room to move to another subject, or if you can do it slickly without making it feel awkward then you just shift to some other topic that feels engaging without making it look evasive. Again, it's all about maintaining a good vibe. And companies want to know the ins and outs about you, but they also just want to know that you have some social skills in doing stuff like that, because they're running a company with different kinds of people, sometimes from very different backgrounds, and they need the team to work together and feel cohesive. The company and the management are already trying to keep the company afloat and profitable, it's own engineering problem, on top of marketing, on top of operational concerns, they don't want to have concerns around political drama in the office, they want to know that you can be cool. Unless you're a boy genius from Southie, then maybe they'll tolerate a lot of weird shit from you, but you aren't a boy genius from Southie. reply",

I also talked about a security breach that defaced our website, but put it in the context of the overall success of our security practice. In conclusion, I think it's important to be specific about the key negative factor (if asked about) and to frame negative things in a generally positive light, while remaining honest. After all, it's our perceptions and our attitudes that we can change. An interview is not the place to unload your negative feelings.

That’s the time to be more honest about unrealistic deadlines. But even then I’m going to ask a follow up question about what did you do to try to influence change.

I didn’t always do a good job at it early career. There are two strategies, first ask the same “magic wand” questions.  The second is to have an emergency fund large enough to confidently say “no” and knowing that your bills will be paid while you look for another job.

My advice: - write down the stories (use cases) before the actual IV\n  - for each story, focus on what you learnt / succeeded\n  - for the really negative ones, focus on the learning\n  - for the other ones, focus on the outcomes, mentioning  things that worked and maybe some things that did not work  and how you did it This is the part where you have to act the game and avoid being too transparent. Mentioning too much the negative will be seen as a red flag by most hiring managers or recruiters. reply",

My story was that I loved the work and feel a great reward from delivering great products/outcomes, but we got pulled into a bad cycle of poor time management that compromised the work. You’re here to deliver excellence. It’s not about blame, it about finding a place to win. If you can deliver a narrative like that which doesn’t sound bitchy, it’s really powerful. reply",

This is a different kind of example than you have kind of mentioned but here you go - try telling someone that a manager just earmarked you and bullied you into depression or ran you out of the team or company and your regret being complacent[1]. You saw it coming, a poster on the wall but you didn't act in time and you let it fester and that it was a huge learning. That's exactly what had happened and see the result - you will instantly be assumed to be the problem employee; not even for a moment the hiring manager would think, or take into account, that the manager was the problem. At best you can show them as \"challenges\" and how those \"opened doors\" for you in various new \"dimensions\" of \"learning\" and \"growth\" and enabled you to \"mature\" further and helped you start your journey on the \"path\" to \"leadership\" roles. I don't know about you but it disgusts me just typing here. But that is what I have done and that is what I will do. But the best way to handle it is - not to talk about it if you can help it and fill your CV or the \"tell me about challenges in your last roles\" section of the interview preparation with completely made up instances, if you can handle the yarn; I can't and I go bonkers spinning them, so I try to stick to what really happened with little or a lot of \"colour\".

You don't know which of your interviewers did which, but you can assume that everyone has done something they knew was a bad idea. It's also reasonable to assume that an applicant is leaving for reasons. Bored? Wants more money? That's a pretty bad reason. Unhappy? That's a much better reason. What's the catch?

There isn't much recent news on it: https://aphyr.com/posts/285-jepsen-riak is from 2013 and Aphyr hasn't written about it in years. Armchair suspicion since we haven't heard about it in years is that it's pretty much end-of-life, deployed in a few legacy sites.

We got rid of it, because it was WAY oversized for our needs, it requires at least 3 servers to get benefits of architecture and querying data was slow in practice and very unwieldy at start, because you needed to essentially write your own \"sharding\" and paging support for queries. It was essentially big dumping ground for data, that you might read less than write. We tried it at start because it sounded cool to us too. We replaced it with postgres+timescale on one average server. Now after main contributing company folded, Riak is pretty much dead.

But get that software out in the field, grow its userbase, run it for years, and you have thousands if not millions of different uses of it. Take all the bugs that come out of that, fix them, and you have software that is less buggy. So sure, inexperienced teams put out bugs. I do, too... more than I should. Hopefully the egregious one's where it simply does not work never get to production. But the more nuanced bugs and their eventual fixes come from the software running in the wild.

Releasing software was expensive, you had to put it on physical media and ship it. QA was critical role, it was way less expensive to test the hell out it and fix it than it was to ship new code. The idea that computers could be trusted to perform tasks well was easily shattered when things went wrong, and the additional optics of losing customer trust went a long way into driving QA. Fast forward to today, and it's way cheaper to ship code with bugs to prove out an idea works than it is to spend even a few minutes writing test cases and doing even a modicum of QA. Ultimately, it's a not just a combination of all 3 things you've mentioned, which are all contributing factors; the real problem is any level of QA before proving an idea is seen as a waste of time and money. As someone who started in tech support & QA 30 years ago, it's really tough to see. reply",

(It won’t recognise the OS as supported and just refuses to do anything.) It has been reported, but nobody cares. I was told by support that this is a “will not fix” because it’s not a requirement. There is no way anything this catastrophically bad would have made it past QA back when Microsoft used to have an actual QA team. I swear there is a significant portion of development teams out there that are secretly pleased as punch that they can just push whatever garbage they want straight to production without the pesky people in QA “just complaining” and being “obstructionist”. reply",

Create a bootstrapping function that modifies a prototype or class in order to provide functions to register signals and slots and use them wherever you need them.

Other people will tell you to go outside, or to eat low carb, or to lift weights. Basically, you'll get a pile of anecdotal advice from people who are not living your life, and don't know all the possibilities of what could be wrong, including that there could be an underlying medical problem. The more important factor is that you know something is wrong and you want to fix it. Your best bet is to talk to a doctor and/or therapist about it. Get a professional diagnosis of what is actually wrong (or a confirmation that nothing is wrong and this is normal), and then filter out anecdotal advice that isn't applicable to that diagnosis. reply",

These all kind of have different underlying requirements and you might find that some motivate you more than others. For me, bug fixes are necessary but draining. The days where I spend 8 hours putting out those fires absolutely suck. Doing the “create a puzzle and build the solution” stuff is way more exciting, fulfilling, and motivating for me. Your business revenue can really help you out in this department. If it happens to be that you lack motivation for specific things, can you hire those out and focus on working on the things that actually give you joy and satisfaction? The suggestion of therapy is a good one, but I think that figuring out the root causes of your lack of motivation is also a good first step. So when you sit down to work and can’t get going, ask yourself “what am I trying to do, why am I doing it, why don’t I want to, and would handing this off to somebody else give me motivation to move onto the next thing.” Maybe the answer is to sell the business and find something else that’s exciting to work on, or just to give your mind the space to recover. Best of luck! reply",

          "text": "I've been wondering this myself lately, there's a (very) subtle difference between this and burnout, whereby I'm sometimes productive, but I screw a lot of time away \"trying\" to do work when I'm not mentally engaged enough to actually do it. Burnout happens when I have no agency and am not productive enough for a long time, and then hit a wall where I literally can't imagine programming anymore. I also personally had a family member die and got laid off around 2016, and that definitely helped me burn out around that time. What's different since then is that while I'm now in a software career again, I've learned that it doesn't matter... at all, and I shouldn't try too hard to convince myself that it should. In 2016 I was of the mindset that if I was doing it for work, I should be doing it on my spare time too, and that's sufficient to cover my hobbies, but now I realize that's basically stupid and represents a lack of imagination and diversity that a healthy life should have. It turns out that not leaving the house and staring at a screen for a majority of ones time is fucking miserable no matter how much you're making doing it. Dramatic life events are good for learning that there's so much more that matters, and most products and most code basically don't. Should a CPA go home and maintain enthusiasm for filling out forms and engaging with bureaucracy, submitting taxes just for the hell of it? So I do small bits of staring at screens in my spare time, but non-work time is so scare that I consider it too expensive to waste telling computers what to do, and this does help preserve some capacity to do it when it's necessary. reply",

If I had a daughter with cancer, I would probably reduce my commitment to as close to zero as I mentally bear in order to spend time with her, and this just extends into other areas of life; JavaScript or whatever can wait, as interesting as it may be. If I'm sitting down and not able to get into a zone, all other conditions being ideal, I've probably just been trying too hard and spending too much time on it, at the cost of other things that I subconsciously know I should probably be valuing more. This might be even more of a struggle if you have near complete agency of your time. Like a relationship, you spend a ton of time together in the beginning, maybe even for quite a while, but if you trade your friends for them, or all your hobbies for scrolling Instagram, you'll be in for a wakeup call at some point when you can't remember how to show up for yourself. reply",

          "text": "First, read this about focus: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715347 Now, it’s only a matter of what you want. When I went through burn out after being laid off the first thing I did was define what I wanted: * Never again write JavaScript for work. * Watch TV * Play games That became my life goals, basic burn out leisure stuff. What’s important is not the absurdity of the goals, but just knowing what you really want. When I was at peak burn out I really did not want to write software, but I was really good at writing personal applications. If I really wanted to watch more TV and play more games then I would need a place to store these things free from subscriptions, advertising, analytics, and all that shit we hate. So, I created a home media server with custom media software to make it play from playlists in my IPhone. After changing careers I realized I could do the enterprise API management way better than the enterprise, so I wrote a dashboard of web servers and docker container management that included a better way to proxy traffic for the home file server. If the goal is still to maximize time for watching TV and playing games then I need to automate this shit out of the new career. This means adapting this personal dashboard tool to doing job related things. Now I can test and analyze traffic better than the other available tools at work. I still need to write agents for the dashboard tool to run a list of transmission tasks with assertions to close that loop though. Now I have more time for my life goals even at work. My productivity at work appears high. reply",

          "text": "I would not recommend asking people on HN about this. You should seek out a competent mental health professional. These are serious issues, and you deserve competent help. There are just as many people who give good advice as those that mislead you towards bad advice deceptively on HN. The latter group may actually hold dominance given what I've seen of the structural biases inherent in who gets heard overall. Useful advice is often removed or downvoted to the point where you don't see it. This is true of all social media today post-AI. I fully expect this post to be downvoted solely for pointing this fact out, in saying this. You have a lot of life changes happening all at once. Your support structure is unstable as a result, and this puts extra work on you in cognitive load. You don't mention how much time you spend on your business, family, etc, but I'd guess its more than half your time for the former most. Did you take time off for bereavement? (mother, sister, child soon?)\nHave you done a bucket list? Failing to take time needed for changes represses issues, and similar to burnout eventually you crack and succumb to the guilt and stress. Are you sure you aren't just burying your head in work trying to ignore reality? You can only fix this by bringing the issues to the front of your attention and working through the issues, addressing them in turn. There won't be a magic bullet. Right now, given what you've said it seems like you are trying to hide in your work. It will only get worse the longer you do this. Repression has a complex relationship with psychosis, and that's important because eventually if you do nothing people crack. I would suggest you bring someone on to help running the day-to-day of the business so you can take the appropriate time for these issues. Your business must be a bus factor greater than 1 so you don't have to worry about finances during these tough times. Your lack of focus is most likely your unconscious mind telling you that you are running away from working on important issues you don't want to deal with. You may not be able to control the circumstances, but you can control what you do about it. The focus will return once you've worked through the personal issues. If you are unable or unaware of how to go about working on these things, you should seek competent professional help. Be mindful though, there are many mental health professionals who are not great at their job or that competent. These people may run you in a circle. If they aren't helping you within a few sessions and you are putting in the work, move on to a new one. reply",

Changing behaviour of people, en masse is actually kind of difficult.

          "text": "Behavior change at a group level is often driven by sociological forces that start small and build up over time. I highly recommend the work of Damon Centola. His books “Change: How to Make Big Things Happen” and “How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions” are full of stories that help illustrate the concepts he studies. He’s a legit sociologist whose research points to the value of strong ties to help drive persistent adoption and behavior change (whether societal or in product adoption, it’s all based on the same principles). I would not recommend the works by Jonah Berger that also deal with the same topic, because they are primarily based on marketing observations that are often shallow and misleading. For example, the misinterpretation of the “influencer” phenomenon, whereby he concludes that people who gain a following and become popular online actually help shape behavior. That is often, as we now know, only a fleeting phenomenon more akin to a lottery than anything that drives actual change. When you really study the ways in which big products like say, Twitter, blew up, you see that they started with a small group of people who loved them. By the time the “influencers” picked up, the product already had a dedicated audience that made it feel “safe” for the popular person to promote them. Anyway, I hope you enjoy Centola’s work if you check it out. And good luck! reply",

It can be hormonal or chemical. You might get a few people to change a habit - but you've got no chance with the others. You might get one person to change, but if your product requires a group, ie social behavior, you've got no chance. It's good that you recognize that behavior needs to change.
