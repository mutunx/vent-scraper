Need to be able to print with more durable, temperature/chemical resistant materials such as PC/Nylon/ABS or infused materials. I do not need to print multi material models. I would prefer something that doesn't phone home and can work offline. Opensource firmware/software and repairability are important.<p>I am ok assembling the machine and learning how to dial it in. I can do CAD work and make models by hand; I was a machinist in a past life. But, I am not very familiar with 'slicer' software yet.</p></div>",

Prusa's product history simply goes back longer to when 3D printers were more hobbyist kit. But they've grown up just the same.

My first printer was actually a Prusa style i3 reprap kit from 2014 even before Prusa made his company. Are they decent printers for the time? Yes. But they got complacent and had no meaningful updates for almost a decade. They had interesting additions like PANDA leveling, cyloid drives and etc, but end of the day it was still a bed slinger. Their MMU was absolutely garbage. The fact that Bambulab ate so much of their market between the two years it took them to even to sell a core XY printer is a testament of that. The out of the box experience superior for less money and actually great multilateral support. I honestly don’t care too much h for the multimaterial part. Just being able to swap filaments without heating up the hot end is already a godsend. Mind you, I used to promote Prusa the same way I do for bambulabs now for almost a decade.

No. Proof: https://youtu.be/HcSOz-Lsxgg?feature=shared&t=293 So this video's claim, if I got it right while skimming in a subway, is that when Prusa redesigned the part cooling fan shroud to improve overhang performance they also went ahead and improved the slicer, and the benchmark results that have them generally win overhang comparisons around that time may be attributed more to the software fix than the new HW parts. That's very interesting information, thanks for sharing. It's also exactly the kind of thing where a Bambu fan would normally go \"oh, so they just made the better integrated product that works better in the end without the customer having to care why\". But I totally agree they should document this transparently since Prusa Slicer can also be used with off-brand printers to good success. > Prusa slicer is also a fork ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Sure, which it very prominently displays on the splash screeen to this day instead of hiding it, giving credit where credit is due. The difference is that it was forked off from Slic3r much longer ago, Slic3r isn't really actively developed anymore, and Prusa has largely rewritten it since. So it's a false equivalence. This sort of disingenuous comment is the reason a lot of people don't like the Bambu user/influencer brigrading. reply",

It's almost impossible to justify buying their printers today.

You get a CoreXY printer with an enclosure and AMS for a really good price and if you buy their filament in bulk, it is not much more expensive than e.g. Sunlu where buying at least 3 spools per order is mandatory to begin with. The only way to beat Bambu Lab is to be better than them at the 3D printer game, but most companies can't do that, so people have become resentful while grasping for straws to find things to criticize. Snapmaker got the message and decided to come out with the Snapmaker U1, the rest can wallow in their \"open source\" superiority complex to silence critics. reply",

To someone completely new who hasn't followed any real developments occurring in the industry, it was confusing but it seemed like the Sovol SV06 was a good \"starting point\". Well I didn't realize how far behind the industry still was. I thought surely at this point all printers much just be load file -> load filament -> click print. Just like regular printers no? Nope, doing dumb things like using some third party slicer tool, transferring a file to a microsd card manually and then babying the printer for its super slow error prone prints feels like its still a toy not a professional device. Imagine having to do that level of nonsense for your laser printer? Yeah maybe back in the days of \"Office Space\" but not today! I was in a time crunch so out of desperation I took a gamble and dropped a wad of cash on a Bambu X1C. It is what I consider a professional product for normies in my eyes. Most everything else are just toys. I was ready to say Bambu, Bambu and nothing but Bambu but then I read the user's last few sentences. Seems like he is not really looking for a end to end professional product and so hes got infinite options but for anyone else, its gotta be Bambu! reply",

It means purge-free and much faster multi-material printing without outright duplicating print heads like the XL does, and the ability to park and mix nozzle sizes as well. It'll be cool to see which company pulls it off better. As someone who was never convinced by either Bambu's shoddy and wasteful AMS or Prusa's ridiculously humongous MMU+Buffer approach, this is the leap I've been waiting for for an upgrade. Edit: Amazing move to downvote a comment that simply and neutrally adds new information to the thread. reply",

Bambu Vortek seems to just be swapping nozzles so, while that should cut down on waste, it's going to be much slower (XL is already much faster than AMS based printers but comes at a substantial price increase). INDX tool changes are expected to be around 8-12 seconds. Vortek would be probably be around 30+ seconds. reply",

I'm mainly interested in making multi-material faster without upping to the size of an XL, so it looks like the Prusa solution would be a better fit for my needs personally. If Bambu are only swapping nozzles it also means they still need something AMS-like to swap the filament path, which somehow feels a bit clunky. I think having seperate filament paths is overall a cleaner and simpler design. Someone's made an animation of how they think it'll look like: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YNSlx0GJ5Ig reply",

Prusa is by far the most \"open\" probably with the SV08 second because it uses so much from the open source community (it's Voron inspired).

          "text": "I wouldn't recommend a Creality to someone new to 3D printing.  They can be a pain to work with.  They're CHEAP, and there's plenty of aftermarket support, but that ends up turning the printer into a product for someone who sees the printer itself being a hobby, rather than the printer being merely an appliance that produces things. Buying a Creality printer is like buying a hobby-grade RC car (ie, Traxxas, Team Associated, etc.).  Decent out of the box, but you're likely going to be reaching for buying upgraded parts and it eventually becomes a Ship of Theseus. I have an Ender 3 Pro, my list of upgrades: - Replace the crappy flexible mat with PEI-coated flexsteel - Filament runout detector - Motherboard replacement (made flashing custom firmware 100x easier, and uses quieter stepper motor drivers) - Automatic bed leveler - Dual-gear extruder - Customized firmware that changes the 3x3 bed leveling matrix to 7x7 - OctoPi A decent printer will have half of these features already built in. reply",

          "text": "I did a similar path to you (Ender 3 Pro, same updates as you except runout), and I was miserable.  Yes, I learned a lot about 3d printing while doing it, but I basically never printed unless I REALLY needed something, because I knew I'd spend a bunch of time fiddling and failed prints to get it working.  A friend with an unmodified Ender 3 Pro has much better experience. I wanted a Prusa but didn't want to drop the money on it when I first got started, so I thought I'd just add a bed leveler to get less tweaking and more reliable prints, and it went downhill from there. I ended up getting a Bambu P1S, and gave the Ender 3 Pro to my kids school.  In a twist of fate, I basically had to undo all the upgrades I did (I was able to keep the new mobo and Sprite extruder though) because the school IT couldn't allow OctoPi on the network and they needed something they could just drop an SD card in. The Bambu P1S has been a real workhorse.  In the first couple months I printed more stuff than I had with the Ender 3 Pro in 5 years.  And the multi-filament AMS has been a lot of fun for making multi-color prints.  I'm kind of glad I learned everything I did with my Ender, but now I want to focus on creating models and printing. Prusa apparently makes great printers, I like their ideals and almost got one, but in the end I decided to go with the Bambu because of the AMS and a Father's Day sale and have been extremely happy. reply",

As I worked more with it, I upgraded it a ton, putting about as much money into it as it cost (which wasn’t much). In the end, it’s a decent printer for what I want to do with it. I added: * Bed leveler * Flexible build surface * direct drive extruder * second z axis screw drive * octopi Everything except for the octopi was a Creality kit. So it’s not like they don’t know their market is looking to tinker and do upgrades themselves. If you want to make things because the end product is the goal, get something fancier. If you want to know how and why it works, spending a bit more time on the journey part (which might be frustrating), the Creality might be a good fit. It’s not going to have the same user-experience as a Bamboo or Prusa, but for me, that’s okay. reply",

          "text": "This comes with some massive and obvious issues with no clear benefits. The first is the loss of the very desirable property of AM voice, which is that one station can talk over another station in an emergency and still be heard. Another is that encryption creates lots of new problems, and solves no existing problems. The issue of people impersonating pilots on VHF AM, or broadcasting spoofed ADS-B positions is well managed procedurally and through technologies that can cross check each other. The entire system is built on the premise that no single source of information is always reliable. Key management is a non starter, given that pretty much anyone in the world is entitled to own and operate an aircraft, and to generally fly it where they please, and so it needs to work anywhere. The replacement needs to work on any aircraft that will operate in a civil CNS/ATM environment. That means anything from a hot air balloon to an 80 year old warbird, to an F-35 or a large transport category jet. The technology cannot be subject to any export controls globally. Then there’s the fact there are hundreds of thousands of aircraft globally out there that would need to be retrofitted, and ground infrastructure replaced, at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars. Replacing a radio on an aircraft is not a case of just buying one from Best Buy and plugging it in. It needs to integrate with other aircraft systems. This means getting STCs and other approvals, with very substantial engineering effort, with varying (or nonexistent) levels of manufacturer support. The same applies for CNS/ATM systems on the ground segment. reply",

However, frequency congestion and talking in general are the better things to target here. We have had text communication for a long time now and can send clear messages in fractions of a second. Talking on the radio is an art form to try and reduce the amount of time you are pressing xmit so as to not block others while maintaining the expected coding and being clear. Still, people get stepped on and partial messages are received and then someone has to re-verbalize what they need. We do have things like D-ATIS and technology like ForeFlight which brings IFR filing. You can get a clearance sent to your phone while on the ground. That's about as far as things go in most part 91 ops (and many don't even approach that.) Once you are in the air, almost no personally owned aircraft have things like ACARS and all communication is done via voice over the radio. The only way to know that you are getting a wrong instruction is when others hear it and call it out. (MEOW!) > Then there’s the fact there are hundreds of thousands of aircraft Yeah, that's why we are where we are. We still encode NOTAMS/ATIS/TAFs in inscrutable acronyms because bytes were expensive at one point and people had to be able to interpret them with some training. The same systems re-imagined today would use less bandwidth and provide easily readable text and in many languages. We had to slowly bring in ADS-B and then require it for certain airspace; We can do the same with other improvements. The strategies aren't even new. Yes it will cost money. Once not having it costs lives, the money won't be an issue. reply",

The ATC system is responsible for fusing these sources to paint a track on the screen for the controller. The system (at least Eurocat and TopSky, I can’t speak for others) will throw errors if these sources don’t agree. The controller will ask questions if the pilot says one thing and the display in front of them says another.

If I want to know the details, I'll probably read the source code of OSS drivers.<p>I'm wondering if there are more stories or blogs like this (maybe in the 80s too, remember those Hercules cards?). It really warms me up thinking about sitting in a cube, writing code for device drivers, reading docs everywhere, banging my head on every solid wall until I start to see code in air, quaffing coffee one by one, going into deep night...I know it's way more romantic than the real story but I can't keep myself wondering about it.</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I began writing GPU drivers in 2006 and had to support some legacy fixed-function chips from the late 90s at one point. I think you and other commenters pretty much summarized what it was like. Documentation was often poor, so you would sometimes have to reach out to the folks who had actually written the hardware (or the simulator) for guidance. That is the easy part of writing a driver, even today. Just follow the specification. The code in a GPU driver is relatively simple, and doesn't vary that much from one generation to the next. In the 90s some features didn't have hardware support, so the driver would do a bunch of math in the CPU instead, which was slow. I'm contrast, the fun part are the times when the hardware deviates from he specification, or where the specification left things out and different people filled in the blanks with their own ideas. This is less common nowadays, as the design process has become more refined. But yeah, debugging hardware bugs essentially boils down to: (1) writing the simplest test that triggers the unexpected behavior that you had observed in a more complex application, then (2) providing traces of it to the folks who wrote that part of the hardware or simulator, (3) wait a few days for them to painstakingly figure out what is going wrong, clock by clock, and (4) implement the workaround that they suggest, often something like \"when X condition happens on chips {1.23, 1.24 and 1.25}, then program Y register to Z value, or insert a command to wait for module to complete before sending new commands\" . It was more tedious than anything. Coming up with the simplest way to trigger the behavior could take weeks. Well, that's what it was like to write user mode drivers. The kernel side was rather different and I wasn't directly exposed to it. Kernel drivers are conceptually simpler and significantly smaller in terms of lines of code, but much harder to debug. reply",

          "text": "You can download the Voodoo 2 programming manual which is only around 250-something pages long. The Voodoo2 was fixed function; you loaded assets into the voodoo memory then called functions to operate on those assets. The driver takes care of those two roles by loading and managing the assets in the voodoo memory and an API to program the registers on the card to execute functions on the loaded assets. There were more steps involved with geometry processing which happened in the driver but I am unsure if those were handled in user space by the libraries the application called or the driver code itself. This isn't 250 something pages, only 132 so maybe I was wrong, but its a good look into how the Voodoo2 worked: https://www.dosdays.co.uk/media/3dfx/voodoo2.pdf See also: https://3dfxarchive.com/reference.htm A fun tidbit is the voodoo2 has a 2D mode but was not VESA compliant so it could not be used in a PC without being tied to a VESA card for 2D graphics. I believe that ability was there for custom and non-pc platforms. reply",

          "text": "I created a (currently not publicly released) driver for the 1998 Sega Dreamcast's video hardware from scratch. It supports additional features over the driver in the open source homebrew OS, KallistiOS (KOS), like better render-to-texture support (the KOS driver only supports rendering to framebuffer sized textures), tile multipass (which allows for accumulation buffer style effects or soft shadows), and dynamically toggling anti-aliasing on the fly (with KOS it's fixed after init). Some screenshots of my driver can do are here: https://imgur.com/a/DyaqzZD I used publicly available documentation (like https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~jlo/dc/ and the now defunct dcdev Yahoo Group), looked at the existing open source KOS driver, and looked at the source for Dreamcast emulators to figure out how things worked. The GPU in the Dreamcast is a bit more complicated than PSX/PS2/GC since it doesn't accept polygons and draw them directly to the framebuffer. It's a tile-based deferred renderer, like many mobile GPUs, so it instead writes the polygons to a buffer in video RAM, then later walks through the polygons and renders the scene in tiles to an on-chip 32x32 pixel buffer, which finally gets written to RAM once. This allows the Dreamcast to have a depth-only fillrate close to the 360 and PS3 (DC is 3.2 GPix/s vs 360/PS3 4.0 GPix/s), and it basically preforms a depth-only prepass to avoid doing texture reads for obscured texels. It can also preform per-pixel transparency sorting (order-independent transparency) with effectively no limit to the number of overlapping pixels (but the sorter is O(n^2), so a lot of overlap can become very expensive). To get a working driver for the Dreamcast, you have to set up some structures in video RAM so that the hardware knows what polygons are in what tile. Another thing the driver needs to do is coordinate the part of the hardware that takes polygon commands and writes them to video RAM, and the part that actually does rendering. You typically double buffer the polygons, so that while the hardware is rendering one frame, user code can submit polygons in parallel for the next frame to another buffer. My driver started as just code in \"int main()\" to get stuff on the screen, then I gradually separated stuff out from that into a real driver. reply",

          "text": "Funny, I've been reviving an OS I wrote in the 90's as well as the graphics package, window manager and a couple of demo apps that I wrote to go with it. It's been a long and arduous trip down memory lane but after a couple of weeks of work I have it working under Qemu or Virtualbox. The thing that still befuddles me is how to get the COM ports to work, for some reason they really don't emulate those well in either one of those. Yesterday evening I finally got VGA modes 16 and 18 working, so now I have 640x350 and 640x480 graphics. Major milestone, and lots of fun to get it working this far. The last time it ran was 26/Jan/1994 so it's been mothballed since then and the old hardware is long gone. As for how it is done: you use the BIOS to switch modes, then you have some basic info about the memory map of the video mode and usually a page register where you can set which part of the memory on the graphics card is exposed in a window starting at A000:0000. Later graphics modes, such as VESA based modes used a slightly different mode switch and tended to have the option to address all of the RAM in a contiguous stretch doing away with the bankswitching, which greatly improved low level performance. All of the graphics primitives were in software, no HW acceleration at all. reply",

Qemu and Virtualbox both supply similar mechanisms that should expose the com port but I've yet to be able to input or output a single byte through an emulated com port on either. What I'll probably end up doing is first to get a hardware pass through to work and once that is reliable to move back to emulated hardware to see if there are any differences.

          "text": "Writing graphics card drivers in the 1990s was a nightmare, and often the most complex part of an operating system, particularly ones that supported protected mode and virtual DOS machines. Windows/386's graphics card driver was so integrated with the protected-mode kernel that it had an entirely different kernel for each graphics card. It came out of the box with support for CGA and EGA, and a later version added Herculues, VGA, and 8514/A. That was it. By Windows 3.0, it had a more modular architecture - but this made the drivers even harder to write. A driver that would run in user space had to be written in 16-bit assembly or C. And then a secondary driver that would run in kernel space had to be written in 32-bit assembler, and that driver had to completely virtualise the device for DOS apps (and also had to provide a virtual device the aforementioned 16-bit driver could use). Drivers for OS/2 got even more complex: the above 16-bit Windows driver was still needed. Plus a 32-bit protected-mode driver for OS/2 apps. Plus a \"base\" 16-bit driver for character mode when the system was booting, although most cards could use the generic VGA or SVGA driver for that. Plus the 32-bit virtualisation driver for DOS apps. Plus a specialised 16-bit Windows driver that would share the display with the 32-bit protected-mode driver so that both Windows and OS/2 apps could be on the display at the same time. XFree86 was the usual way to support graphics cards on Linux, alongside very simple kernel-based drivers for character support - or more complex drivers for framebuffer support. If you wanted to run XFree86 on OS/2, you had to have a separate executable (just like Linux) for the specific graphics driver. So an OS/2 machine could end up having this many graphics drivers: - Base video driver, e.g. BVHSVGA\n- 16-bit Windows full screen driver\n- 16-bit Windows seamless driver\n- 32-bit OS/2 Presentation Manager driver\n- 32-bit virtualisation driver\n- 32-bit XFree86 driver NT would be yet another driver, although at least on NT it was just a single kernel space driver, and Windows 95 yet another. Windows 95 needed the same virtualisation driver as prior versions. NT didn't typically provide that, but NT was also notorious for poor support for DOS games because of that. Some vendors actually supported all of these. You'd get a couple disks with a graphics card for GEM, DOS (VESA), OS/2 (16-bit and 32-bit), Windows 2.x, 3.x, NT 3.x, and even SCO Unix. The workload to write all these drivers was insane. reply",

          "text": "IBM never had plans for PCs to be graphically impressive (unlike other gaming-oriented microcomputers which had hardware sprites, buffer scrolling, and various special modes), so conceptually its video cards were pretty simple: you change values in video memory, and letters or pixels on screen change accordingly. The rest was on you. Initial setup could be complex (or hidden behind Video BIOS calls to specific firmware), along with memory layout (for various reasons, including production costs), but the thing was basically just an output buffer. There were some accelerators providing mind-blowing functions like drawing a line on screen given its start and end coordinates in hardware, or filling a rectangle with a given colour in hardware. If you used professional CAD programs where taking drawing routines away from CPU meant going from 1-2 fps to “tolerable” object movement, there was a point in paying significant sum of money for such niche device. Later, Windows strongly suggested to graphic card makers to implements most often used window drawing primitives in hardware, and offer them to the system via standard driver interface. That also was of little use to most games. Non-standard modes and hacks to manipulate output settings to make screen scroll without redrawing the whole buffer (which was too slow), and other tricks, like changing mode parameters precisely at the moment some specific part of the image was being sent to the monitor, were sometimes possible, but they don't apply here. Doom engine games render the upper world window on CPU frame by frame, writing resulting pixels to the video memory (status bar can be partially updated, or just ignored for our case). So it's a simple stream of writes, and the difference is in how fast they are processed. What could be different? — Memory subsystem and address mapping. Not sure about the details, but some hardware settings could possibly tell the motherboard chipset to ignore the caching/order/coherency, and instantly return with success from any write while it was in flight. That would mean that any program that also needed to read from video memory could get incorrect or corrupted results sometimes. (Though I contradict myself here: spectres and screen wipe effect in Doom needed to read from the screen buffer.) — System bus type, width, and rate. Smaller delays means more frames per second (if images can be calculated fast enough). — Video memory type, rate, and timings, video chip speed and architecture, internal bus width, presence of caching buffers, and so on. Most important differences, and there are benchmarks of VGA cards in contemporary magazines and on modern retro forums. However, the video card itself couldn't make your CPU work with twice the performance, it only could limit the amount of data that went to screen. I suspect that either the card was not very compatible, and traded simplicity and performance in certain graphical modes for bugs and slowdowns in others, or the numbers you saw were actually incorrect. For example, if video card forced 60 Hz refresh rate in canonically 70/75/85/etc Hz mode, program could start calculating nonsensical delays, insert rendering cycles that did nothing, and show crazy stats. reply",

When you disqualify arbitrarily, and can't find anyone because of that, its your fault for disqualifying everyone, not the market's fault for not having the ballerina that doesn't exist. Want a programmer in a language thats only 10 years old with 15 years of direct experience? You aren't going to find it even when the creator of that language applies. You pay to have the work done. That is the only legitimate requirement for hiring someone and remaining employed, and you can't go and change the requirements later when they show they can do more. Doesn't matter if they moonlight, are overemployed etc. That view to disqualify such people are in fact monopolistic practices designed to disenfranchise wages that are already low and distorted because of money-printing, they are not red-flags. Its like the flawed type of thinking that \"We need someone to do this work, but this guy is so overqualified he'll leave first chance; so we won't hire anyone\". You hire to have a job done. You don't get to be an arbitrary slave master. \nThe moment you lose sight of this is the moment you ignore your immediate needs, and drive your company on a path towards failure, and if its a consolidated large company, that failure and bad decisionmaking will impact a lot more people because of the centralization/concentration. Financial engineering can decouple the need for immediate action, but the tradeoff is that the risk of not doing things you should have done becomes far greater to your long-term sustainability, and its completely invisible. There is no place for deception and coercion in the hiring process. If the job doesn't exist, don't jam communication channels. Jamming channels is tortuous interference. reply",

          "text": "Sure, there is naturally a sieving process in any hiring, and the issue of AI/scams/bots is simple to solve because it was solved before AI was around before people got lazy. Fraud and misrepresentation isn't a new thing or even \"being unsolve-able except in just one way, your chosen route\". The answer is simple... Require that they come in and show up physically to the office to verify their CV/application/Driver's License, and at that time since there will be cost on the business side, also cross-check if they fit other open positions you have, or if they are interested in hearing about other positions (the answer will almost certainly be yes). Rapidly promoting from within naturally bubbles the competent to positions without a lot of external risk like what you've described. This is how you build a resilient pipeline of talent, and vet the soft skills people who would be good at the job that you'll never find through an interview except by moonshot chance. When you structure it from the get-go to exclude excessively and use bad indicators, you have bad data in and get bad outcomes out. > LinkedIn Profile is a good way to sort through. Its not, there are plenty of fake LinkedIn Profiles. You can't stand out as a real human when you have pigeonholed everyone into a circular peg and set the sieve requirements to a square peg. Forcing people to all go through a online centralized portal, even when they show up in person, is what promotes these perverse incentives. Not rocket science. As a business you can do a lot to solve problems, and there's no way you can stand out as a human among the noise of digital artifacts where bots mimic real humans in the same digital environment. Go physical. I've friends who are executives that do hiring, their main complaints were we've tried to hire people for X positions, and our top 10 candidates  were all fake, we spent months on this with numerous interviews (cost) and have to start all over from scratch. I pointed out the answer is rather stupid simple. Go old school verify the inputs are real at the beginning of the process, not at the end after you sunk all those costs. That's what they've been doing since then and it works. Finding the right talent is a cost you have to pay that you can't push off on other businesses through use of products or services where that business may lie/misrepresent because each business is different, and if you depend upon that one pipeline for talent they can and will eventually cause issues where you can't find talent. The attitude you seem to have mirrors the same things I see in people who simply don't want to pay the cost to get competent people, and by extension don't want to actually be in business. Also, conditions worsen when you spoil an entire labor pool over decades through bad management in consolidated hands, it gets harder and costlier to find qualified labor. Its the nature of ponzi; costs go up unti outflows exceed inflows. If you don't get ahead of the labor crunch, it will crush you, and most competent people given the adverse circumstances in hiring are now retraining resulting in brain-drain, a hollowing out and watering down of the competency in the labor pool. What happens when you can't find qualified people at any cost because your practices drove them to other sectors. They won't come back because they wrote it off as a bad investment. Its psychologically sticky. People always have a choice, even when others try to make it so they don't. reply",

I'm finding that a completely blank linkedin profile (listing only companies but zero detail) is a bigger red flag than not having a linkedin profile. But having a profile with job description info and a network of connections from each job adds credibility. When a resume looks borderline suspicious, I dig through the persons connections in linkedin to see if it looks like they really worked at each of those places. Even better if I find any shared connections, which is a stronger signal that I'm looking at a real person not an AI bot. Also, building that network of connections can be a source of job leads on its own. reply",

But that doesn’t mean you jump off of a 30 story building and hope to survive. Whether I like LinkedIn or not is completely irrelevant.  I play the game, add connections, post a few banal “Thought Leadership” posts, ask for recommendations, etc. My remote job at BigTech fell into my lap in mid 2020 and at 46 because an internal recruiter reached out to me, I got my next job two years ago within a week after I started looking because of targeted LinkedIn outreach.  My current job also fell into my lap two weeks after I started looking because an internal recruiter reached out to me. It does absolutely no good being good at your job if no one knows it. I think even in the current job market, someone would give me a job or a contract relatively quickly if I needed one based on my network, LinkedIn profile, and positive impressions I’ve made in my niche over the past 7 years. reply",

My primary reason for this was that unfortunately some resumes seem to include quite of bit of creative writing -- creativity which the applicant could bet only I, and my company, would see. If, however, the applicant had posted similar claims about past jobs on LI, it was public for all to see so somewhat likely to be less \"creative\" as most people find it embarrassing to get _caught_ claiming credit for work that someone else did or giving an overblown explanation of the import of their work. This is, of course, not 100% reliable as I've seen coworkers and past employees posting on LI claiming things they were \"responsible for\" or \"implemented\" when, in fact, they only had a tiny role (or, occasionally, even no discernible role) in. Also, if I happened to notice a \"connection\" that I also knew, I could potentially ask them about the applicant (using due care to make sure that the applicant wouldn't be \"outed\" at their current job by my doing so). reply",

Half the time, you get someone named Ralph McGuinness on for a quick code screen and they have a thick Mandarin accent or something equivalently implausible. The best first filter we have at the moment is to programmatically toss out any resume that doesn't have a LinkedIn, that has a hallucinated LinkedIn that doesn't resolve, that resolves to a name that doesn't match the resume, that has no connections or history, etc. It's an absurd state of play that hurts those of us trying to hire and those of you trying to get hired, but also a trivial hurdle for you to clear, so stop arguing and just do it. reply",

A seasoned LinkedIn page is also becoming very valuable for applying to remote jobs. Remote employers are getting nervous with all of the overemployed people and fake applicants.

At some point, you are going to fail the age test at FAANG+, with emphasis on the \"A\". I interviewed at one startup and absolutely aced the interview and \"exam\". They hired a couple of kids, so when the systems crashed on a weekend, they were partying in Tahoe, but you know what? Nobody cared. They were bought out by a two-letter company. I aced a LOT of interviews, to no avail. OK, you're then into consulting gigs with really small startups who have no \"HR\" department, so they goof and actually hire qualified people. But at that point, it really 100% depends on your networking (It may be so for all jobs these days with AI-driven recruiters and AI-driven  applicants (out of necessity, if not by choice)). Build and maintain a large and strong network, and at some point, that might get you past the \"gray hair recognition\" system. reply",

          "text": "I'm nearing the end of my career, so take this with a pinch of salt. What I find so interesting in posts like this, is the mindset that \"someone has to give me a job, else I can't work in IT\". By contrast, when I started, there were jobs sure, but the whole IT industry was so new that most people just found ways to \"add value\". Our (future) customers didn't know what they needed, we just built it for them. Today we'd call this a 'startup' (although we were bootstraped, no investment. ) There's still a strong \"build it\" approach to IT , but mostly it now attracts those \"looking for a job\". With hindsight I get that most people (in all industries) are workers, not creators. I used to think IT was mostly creators, but I'm not sure that was ever true. (More likely just the circles I frequented.) And yes, it's harder to be a creator now. Marketing matters more than coding (it always has) but there is more competition now. So to answer your question, the time to quit is when you can't add value. If you can see past the \"get job\" part, and see the \"add value\" part, your options are still open. So my advice is; help people. Spot the pain, ease the pain. Maybe it's helping folk at a nearby old-age-community with their cell phones. Maybe it's helping a local corner shop get on the web. Maybe it's simplifying a tedious process. By helping real people you get to meet more people. And ultimately it's people that get you hired. Good luck. reply",

I'd love to be able to outsource all that to a trusted assistant that I pay a fair wage to.<p>back of the envelope math makes something like this seem like it should be financially plausibly for a lot of folks:<p>- ask a mid-career software engineer making 150k if they'd trade 10k/year to get an additional 10hrs/week of free time back, and I think a LOT would say yes.<p>- at that rate an assistant would get 4 clients to work a 'normal' 40hour week and make a ~median salary of 40k/yr.<p>So why don't we see arrangements like this? is there something about American class psychology where it feels <i>wrong</i> to employee somebody to do this? or are people just unwilling to trust somebody to do things on their behalf?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Didn't say that snow/lawn work was $10k/year, I indicated that was in addition to (more expensive, typically) housekeeping services. My point was that Americans very much hire household assistants, but they're specialized and on-premises for a short time to maximize value and minimize costs. In the past week, I've had housekeepers, lawn service, a plumber and a handyman at my house. They were all great, and did better work than I would do, but I wouldn't have any of those people do the jobs of any of the others. Why pay $20k to a generalist 10 hours a week when I can get specialists who can do more in less time? There just isn't a great need for non-specialized assistance at $20k/year. My housekeepers and lawn service are on auto-schedule and auto-pay, so they require a bare minimum of my time. I would have a hard time trusting a low-paid part-time personal assistant to facilitate and review plumbing and construction work beyond the most basic fixes. Think about a single renter with a small to medium size apartment. They don't need groundswork or maintenance, that's included in the rent. How much housekeeping do they need in a small to mid-size apartment? They often get grocery/food delivery and/or just microwave stuff. There are plenty of delivery laundry services or apartments with washer/dryers en suite. How many errands do they need to run that they don't need to be personally present for? You can't send an assistant to the DMV, after all. Think about dual high earners with kids. They're going to need child care, and that's going to take a huge bite of their income. They don't need a 10-hour-a-week assistant, they either need more than that at home (a nanny), or they're white-knuckling it to save for their kids' current or future school tuition. Think about a single-earner couple. One of the couple can stay home and take care of the kids and all of the things that an assistant could do. tl;dr: Americans absolutely hire human assistants, just not in the kind of generalist model you're thinking, because it's just not worth the kind of money it would take. reply",

          "text": "I could benefit a lot from hiring housekeepers, but shame and trust are probably at the root of why I don’t. Shame: I feel like I should be able to handle it, and would be embarrassed to have to pay someone to clean up after me. I’d feel the need to clean before they come. I also think it would be awkward to be sitting there, probably doing nothing, while paying someone else to work. Realistically, I’m not busy enough to say I don’t have the time; I just don’t do it. Trust: I don’t trust people to be in my home when I’m not there, or even to be alone when I am somewhere in the house. So the whole idea of having someone in everything to clean becomes a non-starter. Having experienced what it’s like to have housekeepers when staying with my dad for a bit, there is a third thing, and thats having to set things back up after they’re done. Every time the housekeepers came I would have to go through random cupboards and drawers to find things they moved out of the way while they were cleaning surfaces, and didn’t put back. It drove me nuts. My dad also had some security cameras setup, so I saw them playing around with whatever he had lying around, which didn’t help my trust issues. I do hiring people to handle my lawn and landscaping. I have allergies, so that’s an easy one to excuse, and it’s all outside, so the trust thing isn’t so much of a problem. A lot of these problems go away with a robot. The trust issue is still there, but it’s more about trust in the company providing the robot to not collect or use personal data, I would want it to be completely offline. I don’t have to worry so much about theft or it messing with my stuff. The shame issue goes away completely, assuming there isn’t a social stigma to owning one. reply",

I call this the “delegation paradox”: even when the math works, people resist letting go. - Psychology: self-worth gets tied to “doing it yourself,” so outsourcing feels like weakness or elitism. - Trust: Handing over personal tasks (groceries, errands) feels riskier than it is. - Friction: hiring, scheduling, and managing another human adds overhead. - Perfectionism: many would rather do it “their way” than risk compromise and not have the job done perfectly. Ironically, these same barriers make people more comfortable with AI assistants, where with AI, you have less friction, less stigma, fewer trust issues.

Occasionally, if I’m out, my wife will order groceries and I will swing by and pick them up. Meal prep? Before we moved, we had a friend who was a professional chef and we would occasionally pay her to do meal prep.  I’m sure we could find someone here. Housecleaning? There are plenty of services you can call. The only other errands I run on a regular basis are haircuts, manicures and pedicures (something that. Lot of men don’t do) and doctors appointments. Funny enough though, I live in a unit of a condotel that we own ( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/condotel.asp ). It is a 2/2 with a full kitchen, living room and washer dryer, everything came with it.  We pay $800 a month for the HOA that covers everything - electric, water, minor maintenance, internet, part of the insurance, someone comes in every other day to change  the trash. When we decide to leave for an extended period of time, the property management company rents it out and we get half the income - we just pack up our stuff in suitcases. When we are here, we can schedule a full cleaning for $80. My wife hasn’t worked since 2020 - I “retired her”. She has her passion projects that keeps her busy and brings in some pocket money for her.  But it does help when it comes to things like going to get the car fixed, following up with various things, doing some of the arrangements for our crazy traveling schedule etc. and she does 100% of the cooking which we don’t do that much. reply",

The way the browser can still participate in choosing is by e.g. not listing AV1 as supported when there is no hardware decoder on the local system. Both Safari and Edge took (approximately) that style of approach, but it comes with the downside that if the server only has AV1 video then the client gets nothing. Practically, that downside isn't a big deal until codec support is high enough sites start assuming the codec is just supported and they don't need to host alternative options. reply",

You can tell Youtube to prefer AV1 only for low-quality videos ( https://www.youtube.com/account_playback ) or you can install an extension that will force h264 playback where supported. Other playback features such as ambient mode and volume equalisation can also impact performance, though that kind of depends on how fast your web browser is at executing Javascript, and to a much smaller extent. The substantial bandwidth savings are here to stay, though, so in time I think Youtube will move to AV1 more often. reply",

I have 38 locations in my (huge) city saved in Google maps and it breaks when I ask it to find a way from point A to point B. Works fine when logged out. Maps also put traffic signals where there are none, and while finding shortest path it stopped putting weights to traffic signals. So you could have it route you via a city's main street instead of the freeway because it's 2km shorter but it ignores the 9 traffic signals that wastes 15 mins. Apple maps works fine. Google search on web has adopted bad UX, and clicking a map or a shopping item has a noticeable delay between. Also right click \"Open in new tab\" options are gone. Are you saying all these \"enshittification\" changes are deliberate? reply",

Often, the lower-quality and some medium-quality video stream will also contain audio, but the higher-quality videos are often silent with a second audio stream mixed in. I can imagine that your older computer might have native support for decoding the high-res h264 video, but not for the high-quality OPUS audio stream, causing them to decode at different speeds. I don't think there's a solution to that problem that doesn't involve running a dedicated video player such as VLC. That said, I've also heard a lot of complaints from people still using Adblock Plus. I don't know what rules ABP has implemented, but they seem to affect Youtube performance much worse than uBlock whenever Youtube changes something. reply",

If I have a Chrome window with a YouTube video running to the side of my monitor, it always inevitably ends up freezing up the whole display. Ctrl+Alt+Delete and cancelling back in makes it go away briefly, however sometimes it can just keep freezing the monitor up constantly. The weird thing is, the PC (running Windows 11) has a powerful graphics card which can handle AAA games (as of earlier this year at least), graphics drivers are all up to date, and YouTube works fine in fullscreen across the whole ultra-wide monitor. I just can't work out what's causing it. It makes running YouTube side-by-side with other programs a real pain in the ass. It's been like this for months now. Checked browser HWA settings, and they're all as they should be. reply",

For my 2019 gaming laptop with a i915+RTX2060, if I leave the switchable option on in the hardware settings (meaning the OS can choose which GPU to use ie. iGPU for low power), I end up with similar behavior in Linux/Win10. The external port actually uses the dGPU so rendering must go through it but it will struggle with the switchable option and I end up with freezing or stutters. In Linux, I explicitly configure Xorg to only use the iGPU and reserve the dGPU for model inference which fixes the stuttering issue. When booting into Win10, I explicitly disable the iGPU and turn off the external monitor so my VR playing doesn't stutter or youtube doesn't freeze or stutter. reply",

What are you trying to accomplish? Where do these constraints come from? Where does the no dependency constraint come from? Where does deploying anywhere come from? Where does checking the connection come from? What is the real problem you are trying to solve? These questions are to avoid the XY problem, to avoid the trap of solutionism, and to get to the \"Job to Be Done\". Someone once asked me how to solder a thick copper wire to a thin steel plate. When I asked him why, I listened in disbelief as he answered that the fuse blew out and that he was going to get a thicker wire and solder it so it doesn't blow out. His solution comes from an incorrect diagnosis of the problem at hand, and he asked me about the solution framed as problem, not the true, root, problem. To answer your question: it depends. reply",

          "text": "AOSP is still the better OS. It is fully open source. It has a much better protection model. It is production ready and optimized. It has a working build system. It supports reliable updates. I find the idea of Linux phones pointless. Instead of trying to create an app ecosystem that will never compete against proprietary-ecosystem optimized and well-isolated one, we can leverage it. I wouldn't want an OS where the banking app can peek into my browser. Desktop OSes are still like that and that's crap OS design in 2025. It has been crap since 90s. Linux being popular has significantly hindered OS innovation in open source world. If you would like to help, I think helping projects like LineageOS or GrapheneOS is better. You can also try joining reverse engineered driver efforts for open source drivers like Freedreno. You can help porting device-specific kernel drivers to mainline. So we can boot whatever kernels we want on normal Android phones with Mesa OpenGL. \"A lot of C experience\" doesn't really tell anything. Have you worked with cross-language systems? How much you know about ABIs? How about interface definition languages (IDLs)? Have you actually written a production driver for Linux systems? Have you implemented any system-level service that got deployed a number of nodes? You need to join somewhere and improve things marginally. reply",

          "text": "Do you behave internationally obtuse or do not really understand that \"Linux\" is often used for GNU/Linux systems and this is what meant by \"Linux phone\". What makes AOSP a better and more meaningful target for a truly open source system is being also open source and having a much better userland implementation that is supported by specific kernel patches that isolate client programs from direct hardware access and from each other. Moreover it has better libraries for creating mobile apps. It has a better and established ecosystem full of experts, some of which already implement FOSS apps. No GNU system has anything close and getting close is a huge engineering effort that you don't need to do. What AOSP does is actually workaround or extend Linux kernel with a system layer that makes the runtime for apps look more like a microkernel. It is a much secure design for carrying a general purpose computer with GPS, Camera and Bluetooth on. So why not just improve Apache-licensed AOSP? Port the closed drivers to open source ones and everyone can utilize all of AOSP's benefits, without being controlled by Google or phone manufacturers too (as long as you can modify the software). FOSS friendly phone vendors can always help with porting efforts and remove blockers. reply",

          "text": "It's not great, IMO. I'm a Librem 5 owner, but I haven't really been able to use it, due to the atrocious (unusable) battery life, and broad incompatibility with most of the things that I need to do with a phone. I've been a proud Linux user since the 90s, so by rights I should be exactly the market they're trying to capture -- slightly paranoid, FOSS-idealogue, willing to trade off some (or even a lot of) usability for freedom (and these days, a degree of protection from that thing that is happening in the USA and elsewhere, which is no longer safe to call by its name). Yet here are the things that I cannot do on my Librem 5 that I basically need to be able to do in order to subsist: - Go for more than 5h without charging - Google Maps. I know -- on my GrapheneOS handset, I have OSMAnd+ and OrganicMaps (installed via F-droid no less) but as it happens, I live in a city with a lot of bridges and even more traffic, and if I want to get anywhere without a +/- 1h variance due to traffic, I depend on live-traffic-informed maps. - Signal. (note: It's been a year or two since I checked in -- is this available yet on Librem 5?) - Parking apps. My city has invested heavily in integration against just one of these apps, and it happens not to run on Librem 5 (or, for that matter, GrapheneOS -- why does a _parking app_ want attestation? smh). This is becoming increasingly inconvenient as competing apps seem to be in retreat and I am getting used to circling, waiting for spaces that I can successfully pay for. - Ability to run local government app, which is available for both Android and iPhone, but obviously not Librem. This was more urgent during the pandemic, when it was required for various things like crossing borders and proving Covid status, but it's still hard(er) to get service from some agencies without it. I have my Librem 5 in a drawer with my other fun tinkering toys, like my Raspberry Pi collection and 5\" touchscreen modules (and breakout boards etc.) I still have plans to install it in my car at some point (it would be a good fit for an always-charging scenario.) Every once in a while I take it out and admire it and dream about the possibility of a future without domination. Then I put it away again. reply",

To my knowledge whole world is now ran by this principle, we are forced to be part of the system and pay taxes, we will be punished if we don't. Taking this under account I come to sad conclusion that it's difficult to find a country that is not facist, certainly not the EU (a.k.a. another \"thinker\" Spinelli who came with his own communist manifesto which was adopted as EU's cornerstone, one of the main EU buildings carries his name), not the country I live in, I don't know about real USA posture but I guess it's similar- try to hire somebody or be hired without letting the state know and you'll face massive problems. reply",

The phone was still a bit under powered but after lots of tinkering it could do most everything I wanted it to. Battery life was the biggest issue, I could get about 5 hours max out of it. It would also get a bit hot at times which while not a huge problem was annoying. Problem is I dropped it on a run and broke it right before they announced they are discontinuing it. So I'm trying to find a new one, but the options don't look super great. If you are willing to use an old downstream (android) kernel, then there are quite a few options, of which i like the FLX1 best. But that makes running some up to data apps harder. I'm having a hard time finding good options mainline options though. The pinephone is too underpowered for daily use. The latest shiftphone and fairphone seem promising but full mainline support still isn't quite there and they pretty pricey too compared to the ppp. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Here is the prompt I gave both Claude Code CLI, and the VSCode agent for my TS project:<p>```<p>I have modified the type signature and behaviour of how jobs are created. Previously, job definition create took a batch argument (created from a queue). Now it takes the queue directly, is async, requires the databaseClient to be passed in at creation (vs. when the batch is executed). It no longer returns anything - which is fine because the result was only being used for logging - which is now done for us so we don't have to worry. Can we refactor the codebase to make use of the new JobDefinition.create? Remove the vestigial \"Job created\" log please.<p>Perform this task and this task only. If you see something unrelated that you believe needs to be refactored - DO NOT MODIFY IT. ONLY PERFORM ACTIONS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THIS TASK<p>```<p>So there are two instructions:<p>1. Do the task<p>2. Don't do stuff that isn't the task (added in frustration on subsequent attempts)<p>My experience:<p>The agent flow started well - it found all the files that needed to change and began making edits.<p>By about file #5 I noticed that on top of requested refactor it started re-ordering object keys of the `JobDefinition.create` method. Although semantically a no-op, this was incredibly frustrating as it made diffs much harder to review.<p>A little later, it started to modify log messages it wasn't happy with before eventually completely going off the rails and adding arguments to my function definitions that it _thought_ they needed (introducing type/run-time errors).<p>VSCode would periodically pause and ask for a confirmation in order to continue. Each time I used the opportunity to re-prompt the agent to stay on target:<p>Me: \"STOP GOING OFF TASK - STOP RENAMING VARIABLES, REORDERING PARAMS. JUST DO AS THE TASK TELLS YOU AND NOTHING ELSE\"<p>Agent: \"You're absolutely right. I apologize for going off task. Let me focus solely on the task: refactoring JobDefinition.create calls to use the new signature and removing vestigial \"Job created\" logs\"<p>And each time the bad behavior would return after some time.<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I assumed this sort of mechanical monkey work would be bread and butter for an agentic workflow - but it just keeps losing coherence.<p>I ended up reverting all the changes as I had absolutely 0 trust in the quality of the generated code.<p>I apologise for the wall of text but I'm quite frustrated about all the time wasted and am desperate to know what I'm doing wrong!<p>Thanks in advance!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The mode is getting lost because the task you gave it, is way up the context chain from what it is currently working on.  It loses track of its task and starts working on other things that it notices. The way to get around this is to never have the model just “do the thing”.  Have it create a plan and create a todo list from the plan (it will do this on its own typically in Claude Code), the. You “approve” the plan, then start working against that todo list and plan. This ensures that the “task” is never very large (it is always just the next thing on the todo list, which has already been scoped to be small) and there is never any ambiguity over what to do next. So for your prompt I would ask it to find all locations that use the old job api and put them in a planning document.  For each location, have it note if it anticipates any difficulty transitioning to the new api in the planning document.  If you want to get fancy, have it use the Task tool to have a subset do the analysis, this keeps the context of the main model less cluttered.  I usually use planning mode for this in Claude Code.  Then look at the plan, approve it (or tweak it) and have it execute that plan. reply",

But first add the button, confirm its showing as expected then move on to a handler, and so on. - Do give warnings like \"Don't modify unrelated code\" but again what the model considers related and what you consider may not be the same (this is much easier if the tasks are small so see point 1). - If the model keeps making similar mistakes or repeating the same broken thing its because it doesn't know how to solve the problem.  These models don't have a way to tell you \"I don't know\" so they will just keep producing busted code.  Give the model additional information to help it like you would a coworker who can't seem to make progress. reply",

          "text": "You're asking Claude to refactor multiple different job types all at once, which creates too much complexity in a single pass. The prompt itself is also somewhat unclear about the specific transformations needed. Try this: 1. Break it down by job type. Instead of \"refactor the codebase to make use of the new JobDefinition.create\", identify each distinct job type and refactor them one at a time. This keeps the context focused and prevents the agent from getting overwhelmed. 2. For many jobs, script it. If you have dozens/hundreds of jobs to refactor, write a shell script that: for job_type in \"EmailJob\" \"DataProcessingJob\" \"ReportJob\"; do\n    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p \"Refactor only ${job_type} to use the new JobDefinition.create signature: make it async, pass databaseClient at creation, remove return value and 'Job created' logs. Change ONLY ${job_type} files.\"\n    git add -A && git commit -m \"Refactor ${job_type} to new signature\"\n  done This creates atomic commits you can review/revert individually. 3. Consider a migration shim. Have Claude create a compatibility layer so jobs can work with either the old or new signature during the refactor. This lets you test incrementally without breaking everything at once. 4. Your prompt needs clarity. Here's a clearer version: Refactor ONLY [SpecificJobName] class to match the new JobDefinition.create signature:\n  - OLD: create(batch) returns result, synchronous\n  - NEW: create(queue, databaseClient) returns void, async\n  - Remove any \"Job created\" console.log statements\n  - Do NOT modify unrelated code, reorder parameters, or rename variables The issue with your original prompt is it doesn't clearly specify the before/after states or which specific files to target. Claude Code works best with precise, mechanical instructions rather than contextual descriptions like \"Previously... Now it takes...\" Pro tip: Use Claude itself to improve your prompts! Try: claude -p \"Help me write a clearer prompt for this refactoring task: [paste your original prompt]\" and save the result to a markdown file for reuse. The key insight is that agentic tools excel at focused, well-defined transformations but struggle when the scope is too broad or the instructions are ambiguous. \"Don't do anything else\" is not an instruction that Claude does a good job of interpreting. The \"going off the rails\" behavior you're seeing is Claude trying to be helpful by \"improving\" code it encounters, which is why explicit constraints (\"ONLY do X\") are crucial rather than specifying a broad directive concerning what it shouldn't do. reply",

The workflow helped me analyse about 300 files. It definitely made up stuff along the way and missed valuable context that I would have seen had I done the analysis manually, but it's a good starting point. Without a structured workflow,  as you said, after 5 files, it's starts going berserk. That said, Claude has been really bad the last few weeks, especially in VSCode Copilot. If you ask it repeatedly, it admits that's its Sonnet 3.5 and not Sonnet 4. Not sure if it's true, but Sonnets workflow has degraded the last few weeks. You would get better results probably by using  search and replace or a python script to make those changes. The comments that insist you'd get better results by talking to it like you would to a human, I hope they're trolling. The idea that the tone of your prompt has any influence at all, is laughable. reply",

          "text": "This comes with some massive and obvious issues with no clear benefits. The first is the loss of the very desirable property of AM voice, which is that one station can talk over another station in an emergency and still be heard. Another is that encryption creates lots of new problems, and solves no existing problems. The issue of people impersonating pilots on VHF AM, or broadcasting spoofed ADS-B positions is well managed procedurally and through technologies that can cross check each other. The entire system is built on the premise that no single source of information is always reliable. Key management is a non starter, given that pretty much anyone in the world is entitled to own and operate an aircraft, and to generally fly it where they please, and so it needs to work anywhere. The replacement needs to work on any aircraft that will operate in a civil CNS/ATM environment. That means anything from a hot air balloon to an 80 year old warbird, to an F-35 or a large transport category jet. The technology cannot be subject to any export controls globally. Then there’s the fact there are hundreds of thousands of aircraft globally out there that would need to be retrofitted, and ground infrastructure replaced, at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars. Replacing a radio on an aircraft is not a case of just buying one from Best Buy and plugging it in. It needs to integrate with other aircraft systems. This means getting STCs and other approvals, with very substantial engineering effort, with varying (or nonexistent) levels of manufacturer support. The same applies for CNS/ATM systems on the ground segment. reply",

However, frequency congestion and talking in general are the better things to target here. We have had text communication for a long time now and can send clear messages in fractions of a second. Talking on the radio is an art form to try and reduce the amount of time you are pressing xmit so as to not block others while maintaining the expected coding and being clear. Still, people get stepped on and partial messages are received and then someone has to re-verbalize what they need. We do have things like D-ATIS and technology like ForeFlight which brings IFR filing. You can get a clearance sent to your phone while on the ground. That's about as far as things go in most part 91 ops (and many don't even approach that.) Once you are in the air, almost no personally owned aircraft have things like ACARS and all communication is done via voice over the radio. The only way to know that you are getting a wrong instruction is when others hear it and call it out. (MEOW!) > Then there’s the fact there are hundreds of thousands of aircraft Yeah, that's why we are where we are. We still encode NOTAMS/ATIS/TAFs in inscrutable acronyms because bytes were expensive at one point and people had to be able to interpret them with some training. The same systems re-imagined today would use less bandwidth and provide easily readable text and in many languages. We had to slowly bring in ADS-B and then require it for certain airspace; We can do the same with other improvements. The strategies aren't even new. Yes it will cost money. Once not having it costs lives, the money won't be an issue. reply",

From an ATC perspective there’s a bunch of possible position sources for an aircraft; MLAT, ADS-B, CPDLC/ADS-C, primary radar, SSR as well as verbal position reports from pilots, depending on a combination of location and ATC and aircraft capabilities. The ATC system is responsible for fusing these sources to paint a track on the screen for the controller. The system (at least Eurocat and TopSky, I can’t speak for others) will throw errors if these sources don’t agree. The controller will ask questions if the pilot says one thing and the display in front of them says another. There are established procedures for dealing with transponders transmitting garbage, for example.

When you disqualify arbitrarily, and can't find anyone because of that, its your fault for disqualifying everyone, not the market's fault for not having the ballerina that doesn't exist. Want a programmer in a language thats only 10 years old with 15 years of direct experience? You aren't going to find it even when the creator of that language applies. You pay to have the work done. That is the only legitimate requirement for hiring someone and remaining employed, and you can't go and change the requirements later when they show they can do more. Doesn't matter if they moonlight, are overemployed etc. That view to disqualify such people are in fact monopolistic practices designed to disenfranchise wages that are already low and distorted because of money-printing, they are not red-flags. Its like the flawed type of thinking that \"We need someone to do this work, but this guy is so overqualified he'll leave first chance; so we won't hire anyone\". You hire to have a job done. You don't get to be an arbitrary slave master. \nThe moment you lose sight of this is the moment you ignore your immediate needs, and drive your company on a path towards failure, and if its a consolidated large company, that failure and bad decisionmaking will impact a lot more people because of the centralization/concentration. Financial engineering can decouple the need for immediate action, but the tradeoff is that the risk of not doing things you should have done becomes far greater to your long-term sustainability, and its completely invisible. There is no place for deception and coercion in the hiring process. If the job doesn't exist, don't jam communication channels. Jamming channels is tortuous interference. reply",

          "text": "Sure, there is naturally a sieving process in any hiring, and the issue of AI/scams/bots is simple to solve because it was solved before AI was around before people got lazy. Fraud and misrepresentation isn't a new thing or even \"being unsolve-able except in just one way, your chosen route\". The answer is simple... Require that they come in and show up physically to the office to verify their CV/application/Driver's License, and at that time since there will be cost on the business side, also cross-check if they fit other open positions you have, or if they are interested in hearing about other positions (the answer will almost certainly be yes). Rapidly promoting from within naturally bubbles the competent to positions without a lot of external risk like what you've described. This is how you build a resilient pipeline of talent, and vet the soft skills people who would be good at the job that you'll never find through an interview except by moonshot chance. When you structure it from the get-go to exclude excessively and use bad indicators, you have bad data in and get bad outcomes out. > LinkedIn Profile is a good way to sort through. Its not, there are plenty of fake LinkedIn Profiles. You can't stand out as a real human when you have pigeonholed everyone into a circular peg and set the sieve requirements to a square peg. Forcing people to all go through a online centralized portal, even when they show up in person, is what promotes these perverse incentives. Not rocket science. As a business you can do a lot to solve problems, and there's no way you can stand out as a human among the noise of digital artifacts where bots mimic real humans in the same digital environment. Go physical. I've friends who are executives that do hiring, their main complaints were we've tried to hire people for X positions, and our top 10 candidates  were all fake, we spent months on this with numerous interviews (cost) and have to start all over from scratch. I pointed out the answer is rather stupid simple. Go old school verify the inputs are real at the beginning of the process, not at the end after you sunk all those costs. That's what they've been doing since then and it works. Finding the right talent is a cost you have to pay that you can't push off on other businesses through use of products or services where that business may lie/misrepresent because each business is different, and if you depend upon that one pipeline for talent they can and will eventually cause issues where you can't find talent. The attitude you seem to have mirrors the same things I see in people who simply don't want to pay the cost to get competent people, and by extension don't want to actually be in business. Also, conditions worsen when you spoil an entire labor pool over decades through bad management in consolidated hands, it gets harder and costlier to find qualified labor. Its the nature of ponzi; costs go up unti outflows exceed inflows. If you don't get ahead of the labor crunch, it will crush you, and most competent people given the adverse circumstances in hiring are now retraining resulting in brain-drain, a hollowing out and watering down of the competency in the labor pool. What happens when you can't find qualified people at any cost because your practices drove them to other sectors. They won't come back because they wrote it off as a bad investment. Its psychologically sticky. People always have a choice, even when others try to make it so they don't. reply",

I would suggest creating the linkedin profile but be sure to fully populate the job descriptions for each job (or as far back as you care to go) and spend some time looking up past colleagues from each one and send them invites to connect. I'm finding that a completely blank linkedin profile (listing only companies but zero detail) is a bigger red flag than not having a linkedin profile. But having a profile with job description info and a network of connections from each job adds credibility. When a resume looks borderline suspicious, I dig through the persons connections in linkedin to see if it looks like they really worked at each of those places. Even better if I find any shared connections, which is a stronger signal that I'm looking at a real person not an AI bot. Also, building that network of connections can be a source of job leads on its own. reply",

But that doesn’t mean you jump off of a 30 story building and hope to survive. Whether I like LinkedIn or not is completely irrelevant.  I play the game, add connections, post a few banal “Thought Leadership” posts, ask for recommendations, etc. My remote job at BigTech fell into my lap in mid 2020 and at 46 because an internal recruiter reached out to me, I got my next job two years ago within a week after I started looking because of targeted LinkedIn outreach.  My current job also fell into my lap two weeks after I started looking because an internal recruiter reached out to me. It does absolutely no good being good at your job if no one knows it. I think even in the current job market, someone would give me a job or a contract relatively quickly if I needed one based on my network, LinkedIn profile, and positive impressions I’ve made in my niche over the past 7 years. reply",

My primary reason for this was that unfortunately some resumes seem to include quite of bit of creative writing -- creativity which the applicant could bet only I, and my company, would see. If, however, the applicant had posted similar claims about past jobs on LI, it was public for all to see so somewhat likely to be less \"creative\" as most people find it embarrassing to get _caught_ claiming credit for work that someone else did or giving an overblown explanation of the import of their work. This is, of course, not 100% reliable as I've seen coworkers and past employees posting on LI claiming things they were \"responsible for\" or \"implemented\" when, in fact, they only had a tiny role (or, occasionally, even no discernible role) in. Also, if I happened to notice a \"connection\" that I also knew, I could potentially ask them about the applicant (using due care to make sure that the applicant wouldn't be \"outed\" at their current job by my doing so). reply",

I personally don't read anything into it, but I know many hiring managers who feel that lack of a LinkedIn page is a negative sign. I don't like it, but it's how the world works some times. A seasoned LinkedIn page is also becoming very valuable for applying to remote jobs. Remote employers are getting nervous with all of the overemployed people and fake applicants. Having a mature LinkedIn page with a decent number of connections to real people is a major positive sign for remote hiring.

The way the browser can still participate in choosing is by e.g. not listing AV1 as supported when there is no hardware decoder on the local system. Both Safari and Edge took (approximately) that style of approach, but it comes with the downside that if the server only has AV1 video then the client gets nothing. Practically, that downside isn't a big deal until codec support is high enough sites start assuming the codec is just supported and they don't need to host alternative options. reply",

You can tell Youtube to prefer AV1 only for low-quality videos ( https://www.youtube.com/account_playback ) or you can install an extension that will force h264 playback where supported. Other playback features such as ambient mode and volume equalisation can also impact performance, though that kind of depends on how fast your web browser is at executing Javascript, and to a much smaller extent. The substantial bandwidth savings are here to stay, though, so in time I think Youtube will move to AV1 more often. reply",

Specifically it's armchair psychology that underestimates complexity. Most of my examples cut against your interpretation rather than in favor of. The 5 second delay was discovered rather than announced, and same with Newpipe breaking, and I don't even agree that the video message had anything to do with a broad principle of always tying communications to user experience. If anything the history is the opposite, rotating through various forms of obstruction all of which nudge user behavior in various ways, perfectly agnostic to any principle of how it gets communicated. reply",

Player base.js: api.XL(\"innertubeCommand\",{openPopupAction:{popup:{notificationActionRenderer:{responseText:{runs:[{text:\"Experiencing interruptions?\"}]},actionButton:{buttonRenderer:{style:\"STYLE_OVERLAY\",size:\"SIZE_DEFAULT\", text:{runs:[{text:\"Find out why\"}]},navigationEndpoint:{commandMetadata:{webCommandMetadata:{url:\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#check_ad_blockers User reports: https://old.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1la6tkm/anybody_no... reply",

I have 38 locations in my (huge) city saved in Google maps and it breaks when I ask it to find a way from point A to point B. Works fine when logged out. Maps also put traffic signals where there are none, and while finding shortest path it stopped putting weights to traffic signals. So you could have it route you via a city's main street instead of the freeway because it's 2km shorter but it ignores the 9 traffic signals that wastes 15 mins. Apple maps works fine. Google search on web has adopted bad UX, and clicking a map or a shopping item has a noticeable delay between. Also right click \"Open in new tab\" options are gone. Are you saying all these \"enshittification\" changes are deliberate? reply",

Often, the lower-quality and some medium-quality video stream will also contain audio, but the higher-quality videos are often silent with a second audio stream mixed in. I can imagine that your older computer might have native support for decoding the high-res h264 video, but not for the high-quality OPUS audio stream, causing them to decode at different speeds. I don't think there's a solution to that problem that doesn't involve running a dedicated video player such as VLC. That said, I've also heard a lot of complaints from people still using Adblock Plus. I don't know what rules ABP has implemented, but they seem to affect Youtube performance much worse than uBlock whenever Youtube changes something. reply",

The reason to play it in mpv is not to avoid commercials (I have a paid account), but because I can then play it from my editor while fully controlling the playback - it works great for watching lectures and taking notes. reply",

If I have a Chrome window with a YouTube video running to the side of my monitor, it always inevitably ends up freezing up the whole display. Ctrl+Alt+Delete and cancelling back in makes it go away briefly, however sometimes it can just keep freezing the monitor up constantly. The weird thing is, the PC (running Windows 11) has a powerful graphics card which can handle AAA games (as of earlier this year at least), graphics drivers are all up to date, and YouTube works fine in fullscreen across the whole ultra-wide monitor. I just can't work out what's causing it. It makes running YouTube side-by-side with other programs a real pain in the ass. It's been like this for months now. Checked browser HWA settings, and they're all as they should be. reply",

For my 2019 gaming laptop with a i915+RTX2060, if I leave the switchable option on in the hardware settings (meaning the OS can choose which GPU to use ie. iGPU for low power), I end up with similar behavior in Linux/Win10. The external port actually uses the dGPU so rendering must go through it but it will struggle with the switchable option and I end up with freezing or stutters. In Linux, I explicitly configure Xorg to only use the iGPU and reserve the dGPU for model inference which fixes the stuttering issue. When booting into Win10, I explicitly disable the iGPU and turn off the external monitor so my VR playing doesn't stutter or youtube doesn't freeze or stutter. reply",

I'd love to be able to outsource all that to a trusted assistant that I pay a fair wage to.<p>back of the envelope math makes something like this seem like it should be financially plausibly for a lot of folks:<p>- ask a mid-career software engineer making 150k if they'd trade 10k/year to get an additional 10hrs/week of free time back, and I think a LOT would say yes.<p>- at that rate an assistant would get 4 clients to work a 'normal' 40hour week and make a ~median salary of 40k/yr.<p>So why don't we see arrangements like this? is there something about American class psychology where it feels <i>wrong</i> to employee somebody to do this? or are people just unwilling to trust somebody to do things on their behalf?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "HIRE BLOCKCHAIN CYBER RETRIEVE TO RECOVER MONEY FROM CRYPTO SCAMMERS My name is Katie Harms and I want to share this cautionary account so others don’t fall into the same trap. A few months ago I applied for a remote position with a company called Cryptogig US. The recruiter appeared professional and the company seemed legitimate. They assured me that my salary would be disbursed in USDT Tether. They requested my wallet credentials to facilitate the deposit. Trusting them I complied. Regrettably this proved to be a grave mistake. The recruiter absconded with my funds and I lost $56,000 in cryptocurrency. Emails bounced, messages went unanswered and I realized I had been defrauded.Feeling despondent and unsure where to turn I contacted BLOCKCHAIN CYBER RETRIEVE. From the outset they demonstrated  empathy and attentiveness. I recounted the entire scenario: the fraudulent job offer, the disclosure of my wallet credentials and the subsequent loss of cryptocurrency. They meticulously guided me through the process and illustrated how stolen USDT can be traced across blockchain transactions. Their technical expertise and attention to detail were immediately reassuring especially during such a stressful time.What impressed me most was their candor and transparency. They did not offer hollow assurances or unrealistic promises but provided a lucid explanation of what was feasible and the potential challenges. They assisted me in documenting all pertinent information, navigating the recovery process and ultimately retrieving my lost cryptocurrency. Every step of the way they were patient in answering my questions and educating me about the nuances of blockchain tracking and crypto security. Their guidance transformed a situation that initially felt hopeless into one that was actionable and structured.Thanks to  BLOCKCHAIN CYBER RETRIEVE  I no longer feel powerless. Knowing there is a dedicated team capable of investigating and recovering misappropriated funds has bestowed me with a renewed sense of confidence and security. Their genuine commitment to supporting victims of crypto fraud is truly commendable. Beyond recovering my lost assets they restored my faith that such incidents can be addressed effectively when handled by experienced professionals. I am sharing my story to raise awareness and urge others to exercise caution, verify company legitimacy and never share wallet credentials. If you ever find yourself a victim of crypto fraud seeking expert assistance promptly can make a critical difference as it did for me.

          "text": "Didn't say that snow/lawn work was $10k/year, I indicated that was in addition to (more expensive, typically) housekeeping services. My point was that Americans very much hire household assistants, but they're specialized and on-premises for a short time to maximize value and minimize costs. In the past week, I've had housekeepers, lawn service, a plumber and a handyman at my house. They were all great, and did better work than I would do, but I wouldn't have any of those people do the jobs of any of the others. Why pay $20k to a generalist 10 hours a week when I can get specialists who can do more in less time? There just isn't a great need for non-specialized assistance at $20k/year. My housekeepers and lawn service are on auto-schedule and auto-pay, so they require a bare minimum of my time. I would have a hard time trusting a low-paid part-time personal assistant to facilitate and review plumbing and construction work beyond the most basic fixes. Think about a single renter with a small to medium size apartment. They don't need groundswork or maintenance, that's included in the rent. How much housekeeping do they need in a small to mid-size apartment? They often get grocery/food delivery and/or just microwave stuff. There are plenty of delivery laundry services or apartments with washer/dryers en suite. How many errands do they need to run that they don't need to be personally present for? You can't send an assistant to the DMV, after all. Think about dual high earners with kids. They're going to need child care, and that's going to take a huge bite of their income. They don't need a 10-hour-a-week assistant, they either need more than that at home (a nanny), or they're white-knuckling it to save for their kids' current or future school tuition. Think about a single-earner couple. One of the couple can stay home and take care of the kids and all of the things that an assistant could do. tl;dr: Americans absolutely hire human assistants, just not in the kind of generalist model you're thinking, because it's just not worth the kind of money it would take. reply",

Furthermore, most of the upper class already does hire cleaners, cooks, etc. The upper middle class, which is roughly the group of people you're referring to, is typically composed of people that are money-focused enough to think spending $10,000 a year on something they can do themselves is a waste.

          "text": "I could benefit a lot from hiring housekeepers, but shame and trust are probably at the root of why I don’t. Shame: I feel like I should be able to handle it, and would be embarrassed to have to pay someone to clean up after me. I’d feel the need to clean before they come. I also think it would be awkward to be sitting there, probably doing nothing, while paying someone else to work. Realistically, I’m not busy enough to say I don’t have the time; I just don’t do it. Trust: I don’t trust people to be in my home when I’m not there, or even to be alone when I am somewhere in the house. So the whole idea of having someone in everything to clean becomes a non-starter. Having experienced what it’s like to have housekeepers when staying with my dad for a bit, there is a third thing, and thats having to set things back up after they’re done. Every time the housekeepers came I would have to go through random cupboards and drawers to find things they moved out of the way while they were cleaning surfaces, and didn’t put back. It drove me nuts. My dad also had some security cameras setup, so I saw them playing around with whatever he had lying around, which didn’t help my trust issues. I do hiring people to handle my lawn and landscaping. I have allergies, so that’s an easy one to excuse, and it’s all outside, so the trust thing isn’t so much of a problem. A lot of these problems go away with a robot. The trust issue is still there, but it’s more about trust in the company providing the robot to not collect or use personal data, I would want it to be completely offline. I don’t have to worry so much about theft or it messing with my stuff. The shame issue goes away completely, assuming there isn’t a social stigma to owning one. reply",

I call this the “delegation paradox”: even when the math works, people resist letting go. - Psychology: self-worth gets tied to “doing it yourself,” so outsourcing feels like weakness or elitism. - Trust: Handing over personal tasks (groceries, errands) feels riskier than it is. - Friction: hiring, scheduling, and managing another human adds overhead. - Perfectionism: many would rather do it “their way” than risk compromise and not have the job done perfectly. Ironically, these same barriers make people more comfortable with AI assistants, where with AI, you have less friction, less stigma, fewer trust issues.

          "text": "Trading $10K of 150K means you really need to earn $13k - $15K pre tax.  That’s most of our travel budget that’s not offset by rental income (see below). For grocery shopping, if I actually did work outside of the home, it would be a simple matter of using Instacart and drive up to the grocery store after work  to pick up the groceries.  Occasionally, if I’m out, my wife will order groceries and I will swing by and pick them up. Meal prep? Before we moved, we had a friend who was a professional chef and we would occasionally pay her to do meal prep.  I’m sure we could find someone here. Housecleaning? There are plenty of services you can call. The only other errands I run on a regular basis are haircuts, manicures and pedicures (something that. Lot of men don’t do) and doctors appointments. Funny enough though, I live in a unit of a condotel that we own ( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/condotel.asp ). It is a 2/2 with a full kitchen, living room and washer dryer, everything came with it.  We pay $800 a month for the HOA that covers everything - electric, water, minor maintenance, internet, part of the insurance, someone comes in every other day to change  the trash. When we decide to leave for an extended period of time, the property management company rents it out and we get half the income - we just pack up our stuff in suitcases. When we are here, we can schedule a full cleaning for $80. My wife hasn’t worked since 2020 - I “retired her”. She has her passion projects that keeps her busy and brings in some pocket money for her.  But it does help when it comes to things like going to get the car fixed, following up with various things, doing some of the arrangements for our crazy traveling schedule etc. and she does 100% of the cooking which we don’t do that much. reply",

          "text": "I'm nearing the end of my career, so take this with a pinch of salt. What I find so interesting in posts like this, is the mindset that \"someone has to give me a job, else I can't work in IT\". By contrast, when I started, there were jobs sure, but the whole IT industry was so new that most people just found ways to \"add value\". Our (future) customers didn't know what they needed, we just built it for them. Today we'd call this a 'startup' (although we were bootstraped, no investment. ) There's still a strong \"build it\" approach to IT , but mostly it now attracts those \"looking for a job\". With hindsight I get that most people (in all industries) are workers, not creators. I used to think IT was mostly creators, but I'm not sure that was ever true. (More likely just the circles I frequented.) And yes, it's harder to be a creator now. Marketing matters more than coding (it always has) but there is more competition now. So to answer your question, the time to quit is when you can't add value. If you can see past the \"get job\" part, and see the \"add value\" part, your options are still open. So my advice is; help people. Spot the pain, ease the pain. Maybe it's helping folk at a nearby old-age-community with their cell phones. Maybe it's helping a local corner shop get on the web. Maybe it's simplifying a tedious process. By helping real people you get to meet more people. And ultimately it's people that get you hired. Good luck. reply",

It supports reliable updates. I find the idea of Linux phones pointless. Instead of trying to create an app ecosystem that will never compete against proprietary-ecosystem optimized and well-isolated one, we can leverage it. I wouldn't want an OS where the banking app can peek into my browser. Desktop OSes are still like that and that's crap OS design in 2025. It has been crap since 90s. Linux being popular has significantly hindered OS innovation in open source world. If you would like to help, I think helping projects like LineageOS or GrapheneOS is better. You can also try joining reverse engineered driver efforts for open source drivers like Freedreno. You can help porting device-specific kernel drivers to mainline. So we can boot whatever kernels we want on normal Android phones with Mesa OpenGL. \"A lot of C experience\" doesn't really tell anything. Have you worked with cross-language systems? How much you know about ABIs? How about interface definition languages (IDLs)? Have you actually written a production driver for Linux systems? Have you implemented any system-level service that got deployed a number of nodes? You need to join somewhere and improve things marginally. reply",

          "text": "Do you behave internationally obtuse or do not really understand that \"Linux\" is often used for GNU/Linux systems and this is what meant by \"Linux phone\". What makes AOSP a better and more meaningful target for a truly open source system is being also open source and having a much better userland implementation that is supported by specific kernel patches that isolate client programs from direct hardware access and from each other. Moreover it has better libraries for creating mobile apps. It has a better and established ecosystem full of experts, some of which already implement FOSS apps. No GNU system has anything close and getting close is a huge engineering effort that you don't need to do. What AOSP does is actually workaround or extend Linux kernel with a system layer that makes the runtime for apps look more like a microkernel. It is a much secure design for carrying a general purpose computer with GPS, Camera and Bluetooth on. So why not just improve Apache-licensed AOSP? Port the closed drivers to open source ones and everyone can utilize all of AOSP's benefits, without being controlled by Google or phone manufacturers too (as long as you can modify the software). FOSS friendly phone vendors can always help with porting efforts and remove blockers. reply",

          "text": "Pine64 announced recently that they drop the PinePhone Pro, but hope to continue with the PinePhone for 2 more years.  To be honest there is not much of a community left when I last checked, and I dont remember when the PP was last in stock, only the convergence? package. But there are a great series of tutorials from Lupyuen where he gets Apache Nuttx running on the PP.  He fills in a lot of the missing documentation and magic smoke details. For example: https://lupyuen.org/articles/dsi#initialise-lcd-controller I'm currently following the same reverse engineering process, but using Zig.  The A64 is quite fun to play with, but I think the hardware might be better suited as a feature phone vs full linux.  I'll let you know in 10 years time hehe. reply",

          "text": "It's not great, IMO. I'm a Librem 5 owner, but I haven't really been able to use it, due to the atrocious (unusable) battery life, and broad incompatibility with most of the things that I need to do with a phone. I've been a proud Linux user since the 90s, so by rights I should be exactly the market they're trying to capture -- slightly paranoid, FOSS-idealogue, willing to trade off some (or even a lot of) usability for freedom (and these days, a degree of protection from that thing that is happening in the USA and elsewhere, which is no longer safe to call by its name). Yet here are the things that I cannot do on my Librem 5 that I basically need to be able to do in order to subsist: - Go for more than 5h without charging - Google Maps. I know -- on my GrapheneOS handset, I have OSMAnd+ and OrganicMaps (installed via F-droid no less) but as it happens, I live in a city with a lot of bridges and even more traffic, and if I want to get anywhere without a +/- 1h variance due to traffic, I depend on live-traffic-informed maps. - Signal. (note: It's been a year or two since I checked in -- is this available yet on Librem 5?) - Parking apps. My city has invested heavily in integration against just one of these apps, and it happens not to run on Librem 5 (or, for that matter, GrapheneOS -- why does a _parking app_ want attestation? smh). This is becoming increasingly inconvenient as competing apps seem to be in retreat and I am getting used to circling, waiting for spaces that I can successfully pay for. - Ability to run local government app, which is available for both Android and iPhone, but obviously not Librem. This was more urgent during the pandemic, when it was required for various things like crossing borders and proving Covid status, but it's still hard(er) to get service from some agencies without it. I have my Librem 5 in a drawer with my other fun tinkering toys, like my Raspberry Pi collection and 5\" touchscreen modules (and breakout boards etc.) I still have plans to install it in my car at some point (it would be a good fit for an always-charging scenario.) Every once in a while I take it out and admire it and dream about the possibility of a future without domination. Then I put it away again. reply",

Having said this, I find it weird people calling some govt facist (and by extension socialist), my observation is all of them are- reading Gramchi's facist manifesto, he says (from memory so not word to word): everything in state, nothing outside of state, nothing against the state. To my knowledge whole world is now ran by this principle, we are forced to be part of the system and pay taxes, we will be punished if we don't. Taking this under account I come to sad conclusion that it's difficult to find a country that is not facist, certainly not the EU (a.k.a. another \"thinker\" Spinelli who came with his own communist manifesto which was adopted as EU's cornerstone, one of the main EU buildings carries his name), not the country I live in, I don't know about real USA posture but I guess it's similar- try to hire somebody or be hired without letting the state know and you'll face massive problems. reply",

The phone was still a bit under powered but after lots of tinkering it could do most everything I wanted it to. Battery life was the biggest issue, I could get about 5 hours max out of it. It would also get a bit hot at times which while not a huge problem was annoying. Problem is I dropped it on a run and broke it right before they announced they are discontinuing it. So I'm trying to find a new one, but the options don't look super great. If you are willing to use an old downstream (android) kernel, then there are quite a few options, of which i like the FLX1 best. But that makes running some up to data apps harder. I'm having a hard time finding good options mainline options though. The pinephone is too underpowered for daily use. The latest shiftphone and fairphone seem promising but full mainline support still isn't quite there and they pretty pricey too compared to the ppp. reply",

Different groups can specialize on different components where they have expertise. I chose RISCV because it's a open standard, we could build around that ecosystem. The standard can be updated, having different generations/versions when it's absolutely necessary. But it shouldn't move too fast especially if the interfaces are clearly defined. Phones from 10 years ago are powerful enough it's just that brands create new devices to force people to upgrade. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been working in tech as a SWE for a good while now, and I’m realising it’s making me miserable. On paper I feel like I should have a very successful career: high-paid remote work, senior/staff level, reasonably-generalist with backend specialization, generally good coworkers / managers, and so on. But in reality, I’m doing terribly! I have relatively short tenure in all my roles, because I somehow keep picking jobs where my manager/coworkers start quitting before I do; my savings were drained by health issues caused by work stresses, so I can’t afford to take an extended period between jobs; employers I end up with, regardless of contract or FTE, always seem to end up making near-impossible demands of engineering that ruin the team’s morale; the list goes on. I see a therapist, I see a number of doctors for the health issues I’ve ended up with, but I feel like no amount of therapy + meds is going to fix the underlying issue.<p>I feel like I’m a failure for being unable to handle what should be one of the most-privileged careers that exists. If I could take a 50-60% pay cut to have a guarantee of reduced stress / better work-life balance, I think I would take it without much thought, but I don’t even know if these jobs exist at this point.<p>How do I get out of this situation? Is being an SWE just not right for me anymore?</p></p></div>",

There is a greater than 70% chance you support some side of a crud app and most of your peers have some level of imposter syndrome but mask their obvious insecurity with aggressive or vanity nonsense. The best thing that ever happened to me was getting laid off from the nonsense. Now I am a defense contractor. My peers are much older. There is an explicit path, for the most part, to release software. People are well trained and actually do real work instead of praying they can pretend to be relevant behind some framework. Now my advice to everyone is the same: find the jobs with the highest barrier of entry. This is completely orthogonal to compensation. High barriers of entry drastically reduce the signal to noise ration in hiring. reply",

This is not a privileged career, it is a (relative to other careers) lucrative one - some within it are privileged, they make bay area housing money, have ownership and stock. FAANG roles, where the most privileged or most prepared to succeed often land, are remarkably stable compared to your experience - such that a layoff is huge news and not just another tuesday like elsewhere in the industry. Many who speak about software development are in this position, and they know nothing else. The contract game is not a privileged game - it is a working class job, where often people live near paycheck to paycheck renting in HCOL areas. For folks on contracts or at low or mid tier companies with mid tier pay, the work is more often than not tightly managed, low trust environments. You get \"butts-in-seats\" managers, you get \"kiss-the-ring\" leadership, you get micromanaged, you get no agency, and you don't get basic human respect. You are your output, and your output needs to meet near-arbitrary expectations regardless of your capacity. If you are sick because of the stress working at a place, they will move onto the next person. This is not the reality for most of the optimistic high risk tolerance (IE: safe and privileged) people on Hacker News, but it is the reality for a huge amount of SWEs. Privilege is relative in this industry and it broadly follows the same lines. Those who already have a lot will be safe, and those with little have to work 3x as hard to have a chance at parity. That isn't to say that one can't rock out, become extremely well respected, make a lot of money, do a startup, or get recognized from skills - the industry does an okay job at not being entirely credential focused, though its gotten far more so in the last 5 years. reply",

That's a break from tech, nice change of scene and fun times, but you still get paid something, so, maybe don't build up debts meanwhile. The Q then is can you get back into tech later after such a break, if you want. Which maybe depends on a few unpredictable factors. Back in the day I did that and many others here on HN have.

          "text": "I can share a personal account - I became disillusioned with the tech industry too, and decided I didn't want anything to do with it anymore. The difference is, I never even got my first job, so I can't speak as if I know everything, but I can attest to my own experiences. I never considered other roles because of sunk cost fallacy. Developing an interest from a kid, going to school and college for 6+ years. With post-graduate unemployment lengthening by the day, I spiralled further. I doomscrolled online, seeing others in similar situations get lambasted, and internalized how worthless I was, that I wasn't trying hard enough, and didn't have what it took to make it. Yet I did all I could and knew, put all of myself out there - so what was left? Conversely, if I gave up, I was weak. If I worked in any other industry, that stat would come up about how \"being underemployed in another field would lock you out of the industry for good.\" - I'd be considered stale bread. My life's work would've been for nothing, so I handcuffed myself to joining the industry, and that's how months became a year, a year became two years without finding employment. Some treatment is despicable. In the very first interview I had, I was laughed at. I was socially inept then, but that still didn't warrant mockery. Dehumanizing tests where I was observed silently, like a hawk. Months of waiting, after 4 rounds, only to be ghosted. Literally being rated and told I'm a \"2\" to my face by an interviewer. When I finally decided to give up on my life's ambition and applied for a retail job, I got an interview within a day and was hired the next. I was able to learn quickly and get promoted to a lead within 3 months. I worked with so many good people, and even if some customers and severe understaffing suck, finally finding a place where I feel valued saved me from offing myself. Obviously, there's a lower barrier to entry. But ironically, I was always fed the notion that these were \"low skill\" jobs where I'd be miserable and abused. That's not what happened - it's the tech industry that drove me to want to die every day for years, even a self-inflicted head injury. And it's in retail where I developed myself further than ever, even with the bad aspects. With my passion killed before even starting, I cannot imagine how I'd feel actually working. I'm aware it's more \"who you work with,\" but with 8/10 interactions going poorly, and trauma from just thinking about it, I decided the industry's not worth the gamble for me. I became interested in software as a means to solve my problems. That was why I started. But I realized I can still achieve what I want without prospects of a career ruining what I once cared for. Now, I get my fill through volunteering for nonprofit organizations and building my own ideas. Looking for a new job, I found some roles that interested me. Deckhand, working on a boat. Car mechanic. Some offered training with no experience, and seemed to pay decently, if not equivalently to entry-level tech, without the judgment and hoops. I've found interest in these more physical jobs, as they keep me healthy too. Long story short - I think it's best to do what's best for yourself, within possibility. Whether that's continuing to explore software engineering in another light (Nonprofits, maybe? https://techjobsforgood.com/ ), or a whole new field. Life's too short to live proving oneself to someone else who doesn't even know you. I've found that common online discourse tends to convince one to ignore problems and put up with abuse, just because someone else has it worse and \"giving up\" is weak. But screw what others may think about \"privilege\" - overwork is an issue... among many others, regardless of relativistic betterness. \"Giving up\" on the mainstream idea of success actually might've been the best thing to achieve what I wanted. Do you still like tech as a passion? Is there anything you've looked into that might interest you? reply",
