I'm trying to build a simple tool that will let me visualize grid layouts.<p>It needs to toggle between landscape/portrait, and implement some design strategies so I can see different visualizations of the grid. I asked it to give me a slider to simulate the number of grids.<p>1st pass, it made something, but it was squished. And toggling between landscape and portrait made it so it squished itself the other way so I couldn't even see anything.<p>2nd pass, syntax error.<p>3rd try I ask it to redo everything from scratch. It now has a working slider, but the landscape/portrait is still broken.<p>4th try, it manages to fix the landscape/portrait issue, but now the issue is that the controls are behind the display so I have to reload the page.<p>5th try, it manages to fix this issue, but now it is squished again.<p>6th try, I ask it to try again from scratch. This time it gives me a syntax error.<p>This is so frustrating.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The truth is that there is a lot of hype. You need to be reasonably experienced and guide it. First, you need to know that Claude will create nonsensical code. On a macro level it's not exactly smart it just has a lot of contextual static knowledge. Debugging is not it's strongest skill. Most models don't do good at all. Opus is able to one-shot \"troubleshooting\" prompts occasionally, but it's a high probability that it veer of on a tangent if you just tell it to \"fix things\" based on errors or descriptions. You need to have an idea what you want fixed. Another problem is that it can create very convincing looking - but stupid - code. If you can't guide it, that's almost guaranteed. It can create code that's totally backwards and overly complicated. If it IS going on a wrong tangent, it's often hopeless to get it back on track. The conversation and context might be polluted. Restart and reframe the prompt and the problems at hand and try again. I'm not totally sure about the language you are using, but syntax errors typically happens if it \"forgets\" to update some of the code, and very seldom just in a single file or edit. I like to create a design.md and think a bit on my own, or maybe prompt to create it with a high level problem to get going, and make sure it's in the context (and mentioned in the prompts) reply",

There are 3 major steps: (Plan mode) 1. assuming this is an existing codebase, load the relevant docs/existing code into context (usually by typing @<PATH> 2. Ask it to make a plan for the feature you want to implement. Assuming you’ve already put some thought into this, be as specific and detailed as you can. Ask it to build a plan that’s divided into individually variable steps. Read the plan file that it spits out, correct and bad assumptions it made, ask it questions if you’re unclear one what it’s saying, refine, etc. (agent mode)\nAsk it to build the plan, one step at a time. After it builds each step  verify that it’s correct, or have it help you verify it’s correct in a way you can observe. I have been following this basic process mostly with Opus 4.5 in a mixture of claude code and cursor working on a pretty niche image processing pipeline (also some advanced networking stuff on the side) and have hand-written basically zero code. People say - “your method sounds like a lot of work too” and that’s true, it is still work, but designing at a high level how I want some CUDA kernel to work and how it fits into the wider codebase and then describing it in a few sentences is still much faster than doing all of the above anyway and then hand writing 100 lines of CUDA (which I don’t know that well). I’d conservatively estimate that i’ve made 2x the progress in the same amount of time as if I had been doing this without LLM tools. reply",

Potentially \"vibe-coding\" as in the sense: you don't know how to develop this yourself (perhaps you are not a software developer?) While this may be possible, it likely requires a very detailed prompt and/or spec document. --- Here is an example of something I successfully built with Claude: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app Apparently I have had over 150 chat sessions related to the research and development of this tool. - First, we wrote a spec together: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-transcription/blob/main/spec... - The spec broke down development into major phases. I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting. And after implementation, I often had to have Claude fix bugs in the implementation. - I tried to share the chat session where Claude got the first functional MVP working: https://opncd.ai/share/fXsPn1t1 (unfortunately the shared session is truncated) --- \"AI mistakes you're probably making\": https://youtu.be/Jcuig8vhmx4 I think the most relevant point is: AI is best for accelerating development tasks you could do on your own; not new tasks you don't know how to do. --- Finally: Cloudlflare builds OAuth with Claude and publishes all the prompts: https://hw.leftium.com/#/item/44159166 reply",

          "text": "Yes, it's a lot of spec work. But a lot of it is research and exploring alternatives. Sometimes Claude suggests ideas I would have never thought of or attempted on my own. Like a custom python websocket server: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-local (I also implemented the previous version with only a high-level, basic understanding of websockets: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app/sherpa ) I think of Claude like a \"force-multiplier.\" I have been able to implement ideas I previously gave up on. I can test out new ideas much faster. For example, https://github.com/Leftium/gg started out as 100% hand-crafted code. I wanted gg to be able to print out the expression in the code in addition to the value like python icecream. (It's more useful to get both the value and the variable name/expression.) I previously tried, and gave up. Claude helped me add this feature within a few hours. And now gg has its own virtual dev console optimized for interacting with coding agents. A very useful feature that I would probaly not have attempted without Claude. It's taken the \"open in editor\" feture to a completely new level. I have implemented other features that I would have never attempted or even thought about. For example without Claud's assistance https://ws.leftium.com would not have many features like the animated background that resembles the actual sky color. 60 minute forecast was on my TODO list for a long time. Claude helped me add it within an afternoon or so. Note: depending on complexity of the feature I want to add the spec varies in the level of detail. Sometimes there is no spec outside Claude's plans in the chat session. [1]: https://github.com/gruns/icecream reply",

In fact, this spec is a spin-off of several other specs on several other branches/projects. - I've actually experienced quite the opposite: I suggest an idea for the spec and Claude says \"great idea!\" Then I change my mind and go in the opposite direction: \"great idea!\" again. Once in a while, I have to argue with Claude to get my idea implemented (like adding dependencies to parse into a proper AST instead of regex.) - One tip: it's very useful to explain the \"why\" to Claude vs the \"what.\" In fact, if you just explain the why/problem without a specific solution, Claude's suggestions may surprise you! reply",

You can one-shot some things, and it makes for an impressive demo (oh yay, yet another video game made instantly) but anything larger and more useful will probably be a conversation. (Though not necessarily with a human, AIs can discuss it among themselves too.) Your first one-shot might be a good rough prototype. From there, you continue the conversation with your refinements. While Claude goes and works on that for 15 minutes - you can go and do other work. Or talk with another Claude in another window to make progress on another project. A good mental model is to imagine you're talking to a remote developer. You need to give them an extremely detailed spec on the first go if you expect them to get it right the first time. Sometimes it's better to explain \"this is my grand vision, but how about we first mockup a prototype to see if that's actually how I want it to work\". Sometimes Claude will suggest you talk about your plan together first to remove the ambiguities from the plan, or you can encourage Claude to do that with you. (Also, the remote developer mindset is useful - treat the remote developer with respect, with humanity, and they're more likely to be helpful towards you and motivated to align with your goals.) Consider that in an hour or two of conversation, you now have your app, completed, fully debugged... and not once did you look at the code, and you spent half of that time catching up on your other tasks.

The agentic harness of the software around the model (ie Claude Code) is important. Consider also that some of us have been doing this for a year and have already built our own MCP server tooling to go faster. Giving your AI the same kind of deterministic software tools that you use is important (eg make sure your AI has access to a diff tool, don't make it try and do that \"in its head\", you wouldn't ask that of a human). As for listening to Hacker News... yeah, this is one of the worst places (well, Mastodon is worse) and HN is surprisingly AI-doomerish. I don't check in here very often anymore, and as of this week I just get Claude to summarize HN headlines as a morning podcast for me instead. My own experience: my first few uses of Claude in Dec 2024 seemed rubbish, I didn't get it. Then one day I asked it to make me a search engine. The one shot from that wasn't perfect, but it worked, and I saw it build it in front of my eyes. That was the moment & I kept iterating on it. I haven't used Google or Kagi in almost a year now. Anyway, hope it helps, but if not using AI makes you feel more comfortable, go with what fills your life with more value & meaning & enjoyment. reply",

That is a very wrong approach, not just with Claude but with everything(you ask a woman for a date and if you do not get laid in five minutes you failed?). When I program something manually and compiles, I expect it to be wrong. You have to iron it and debug it. Instead of that: 1.Divide the work in independent units. I call this \"steps\" 2.Subdivide steps into \"subsets\"\nYou work in an isolated manner on those subsets. 3.Use an inmediate gui interface like dear imgui to prototype your tool. Translating then into using something else once it works is quite easy of LLMs. 4.Visualize everything. You do not need to see the code but you need to visualise every single thing you ask it to do. 5.Tell Claude what you want and why you want it and update the documentation constantly. 6. Use git in order to make rock solid steps that Claude will not touch when it works and you can revert changes or ask the ia to explore a branch, explaining how you did something and want something similar. 7. Do not modify code that already works rock solid. Copy it into another step leaving the step as reference and modify it there. 5.Use logs. Lots of logs. For every step you create text logs and you debug the problems giving Claude the logs to read them. 6.Use screenshots. Claude can read screenshots. If you visualise everything, clause can see the errors too. 7.Use asserts, lots of asserts, just like with manual programming. It is not that different from managing a real team of people... reply",

Last night I added an archive to the Daily Challenge mode, so if you missed a day's challenge you could go back and play it. This is what my initial prompt looked like: --- I'd like to add an archives mode to the daily challenge. This will allow players to complete any daily challenges they didn't attempt on the actual day. It will look like a calendar, with the dates in Green if it was played, and in white if not. The archive should only go back to January 30, 2026, the day the project started. Include a to do to change this date prior to release. Rewards for completing daily challenges via the archive should be 25% of the normal value. --- Claude Code then asked me a couple of clarifying questions before it harnessed the superpowers:writing-plans skill and generate a document to plan the work. The document it put together is viewable at https://gist.github.com/Jeremy1026/cee66bf6d4b67d9a527f6e30f... There were a couple of edits that I made to the document before I told it to implement. It then fired off a couple of agents to perform the tasks in parallel where possible. Once it finished I tested and it worked as I had hoped. But there was a couple of follow up things that would make it more intertwined with everything else going on around daily challenges. So I followed up with: --- lets give 1 cell for compelting an archived daily challenge --- And finally: --- Now that we are tracking completions, can we update the notification to complete daily mission to include \"Keep your X day streak\" --- reply",

          "text": "Another example is the tower stat caps. When Claude Code generate the first pass, it make it so that the tower level would control each individual stat's cap. Which was way too high. I didn't know exactly what the limits were, but knew they needed to be pulled back some. So I asked it: -Start Prompt- Currently, a towers level sets the maximum a single stat can be. Can you tell me what those stat caps are? -End Prompt- This primed the context to have information about the stat caps and how they are tied to levels. I followed up after it gave me a chart back with Tower Level and Max Stat Rank with some real stats from play -Start Prompt- Lets change the stat cap, the caps are currently far too high. All towers start at 1 for each IMPACT stat, my oldest tower is Level 5, and its stats are I-3, M-4, P-6, A-3, C-1, T-1. How do you think I could go about reducing the cap in a  way. -End Prompt- It came back with a solution to reduce the individual stat cap for individual stats to be tower level + 1. But I felt that was too limiting. I want players to be able to specialize a tower so I told it have the stat cap be total, not per stat. -Start Prompt- I'm thinking about having a total stat cap, so in this towers case, the total stats are 18. -End Prompt- It generated a couple of structures of how the cap could increase and presented them to me. -Start Prompt- Yes, it would replace the per-stat cap entirely. If a player wants to specialize a tower in one stat using the entire cap that is fine. Lets do 10 + (rank * 3), that will give the user a little bit of room to train a new tower. Since it's a total stat cap, if a user is training and the tower earns enough stat xp to level beyond the cap, lock the tower at max XP for that stat, and autoamtically level the stat when the user levels up the tower. -End Prompt- It added the cap, but introduced a couple of build errors, so I sent it just the build errors. -Start Prompt- /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerDetailView.swift:231:39 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'tower' is a 'let' constant /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerEditorView.swift:181:47 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'towerInstance' is a 'let' constant -End Prompt- And thus, a new stat cap system was implemented. reply",

It doesn’t work that way (not well, at least) The LLM under the hood is essentially a very fancy autocomplete. This always needs to be kept in mind when working with these tools. So you have to focus a lot on what the source text is that’s going to be used to produce the completion. The better the source text, the better the completion. In other words, you need to make sure you progressively fill the context window with stuff that matters for the task that you’re doing. In particular, first explore the problem space with the tool (iterate), then use the exploration results to plan what needs doing (iterate), when the plan looks good and makes sense, only then you ask to actually implement. Claude’s built in planning mode kind of does this, but in my opinion it sucks. It doesn’t make iterating on the exploration and the plan easy or natural. So I suggest just setting up some custom prompts (skills) for this with instructions that make sense for the particular domain/use case, and use those in the normal mode. reply",

This reminds me of someone who dropped into  #java on undernet once upon a time in the 90s. \"I can't get it to work\" , and we kept trying to debug, and for some reason we kept hitting random new walls. It just never would work!    Turns out that they were deleting their .java file and starting over each time.  Don't do that. --- Take it as a sequence of exercises. Maybe start like this: Don't use claude code at all to begin with. It's a pair programming exercise, and you start at the keyboard, where you're confident and in control. Have claude open in the web interface alongside, talk through the design with it while working; and ask to google stuff for you, look up the api, maybe ask if it remembers the best way(s) to approach the problem. Once you trust it a bit, maybe ask for code snippets or even entire functions. They can't be 100% correct because it doesn't have context... you might need to paste in some code to begin with. When there's errors, paste them in, maybe you'll get advice. If you're comfy? Switch seats, start using claude code. Now you're telling claude what to do. And you can still ask the same questions you were asking before. But now you don't need to paste into the web interface anymore, and the AI sure as heck can type faster than you can. Aren't you getting tired of every iteration where you're telling the AI \"this went wrong\", \" that went wrong\"? Maybe make sure there's a way for the AI to test stuff itself, so it can iterate a few cycles automatically.  Your LLM can iterate through troubleshooting steps faster than you can type the first one. Still... keep an eye on it. And, really that's about where I am now. reply",

In my little experience, what I've seen work is that you need to provide a lot of constraints in the form of: - Scope: Don't build a website, but build a feature (either user facing or infra, it doesn't matter). I've found that chunking my prompts in human-manageable tasks that would take 0.5-1 day, is enough of a scale down. - Docs .md files that describe how the main parts of the application work, what a component/module/unit of code looks like, what tools&technologies to use (and links to the latest documentation and quickstart pages). You should commit these to code and update them with every code change (which with Claude is just a reminder in each prompt). - Existing code, if it's not a greenfield project. It really moves away from the advertised paradigm of one-shot vibe-coding but since the quality of the output is really good these days, this long preparation will give you a production ready output much sooner than with traditional methods. reply",

There are some small things it never has managed to fix that I have to figure out myself, but again, I learn from that. Mapping out a data structure in advance and creating a plan before immediately coding can also help, but at least in our project, sometimes it just takes an incorrect approach and so I don't just let it go off and do things willy-nilly.

Opus is the first model that actually convinced me to use AI as my daily driver - and I’m a developer for about 20 years.\n2. Make the tasks as small and specific as possible. Don’t prompt „create a todo app with user login“ but „create a vue app where users can register, don’t do more than that“, then „build a user  login“ then, „create a page to create todo items“, then „create a page to list todo items“, then „on list page, add delete functionality“ - and so on, you get the idea.\n3. beware the context size. Claude code will warn you if you exceed it, but even before: the higher the context window, the higher AI will miss things. If you start a new prompt that doesn’t require the whole context of the previous one, type /clear. \n4. build an agents.md or Claude.md. /init will do that for you, but it will just create a Claude.md with information that it might think are important - but easily miss things. You know best. It often also includes file and directory structure, while it could easily find out again (tree command) without that info in agents/claude file. Still I recommend: let Claude create that file, then adjust it to your needs. Only add important stuff here. The more you add, the more you spam the context. Again, try to keep context small. \n5. if Claude needs a long time for finishing a task or did it wrong at first attempt, tell it to update the Claude.md with information to not do the same mistakes the next time again.\n6. make sure you understand the code it created. Add conventions to agents.md that will make the code more readable (use early returns, don‘t exceed nesting level of 3, create new methods with meaningful names instead of inline comments etc.) Good luck! reply",

Can make some debugging and fixing that usually requires looking the stack, look the docs and check the tree \n3. Code is spaghetti all way down. One might say it is ok because it is fast to generate, but the bigger the application, every change gets more expensive and it always forget to do something.\n4. Tests it generates is mostly useless. 9/10 times it always passes on all tests it creates for itself but the code does not even start. No matter what type of test.\n5. Frequently lied about the current state of the code and only when pushed it will admit it was wrong. As others said, it is a mix of the (misnomer) Danny Kruger effect and some hype. I tried possibly every single trick to get it working better but I feel most are just tricks. They are not necessarily making it work better. It is not completely useless, my work involves doing prototypes now and then and usually they need to be quite extensive. For that it has been a help.

The idea is, you want to build up the right context before starting development. I will either describe exactly what I want to build, or I ask the agent for guidance on different approaches. Sometimes I’ll even do this in a separate Claude (not Claude Code) conversation, which I feel works a bit faster. Once we have an approach, I will ask it to create an implementation plan in a markdown file, I clear context and then tell it to implement the plan.

I had the newest Claude Code (4.6?) look over the tests on the day it was released and the issues it found were really, really bad. Now, the newest plan is to produce a tool which generates the tests from a DSL so they can't be made to pass and/or match buggy code instead of the clearly defined specification. Oh, I guess I didn't mention there's an actual spec for what we're trying to do which is very clear, in fact it should be relatively trivial to ensure the tests match for some super-human coding machine. reply",

          "text": "The problem is that it’s being marketed like it’s magic and will make people obsolete… not as a tool with a high learning curve. I don’t blame people for being upset when it can’t do what all the hype says it will do. The way people talk about the latest Claude Code is the same way people were talking 2-3 years ago about whatever the latest model was then. Every release gets marketed as if it’s a new level of magic, yet we’re still here having the same debates about merit, because reality doesn’t match the marketing and hype. It has gotten better, I tried something with early ChatGPT that failed horribly (a basic snake game written in C), and just tried the exact same thing again last week and it worked—it wasn’t good, but it technically worked. But if it took 3 years to get good enough to pass my basic test, why was I being fed those lies 3 years ago? The AI companies are like the boy who cried wolf. At this point, it’s on them to prove they can do what they say, not up to me to put in extraordinary efforts to try and get value out of their product. Last week I sat through a talk from one of our SVPs who said development is cheap and easy now, then he went on about the buy vs build debate for 20 minutes. It’s like he read a couple articles and drank the kool-aid. I also saw someone talking about ephemeral programs… seeing a future where if you want to listen to some MP3s, you’ll just type in a prompt to generate a bespoke music player. This would require AI to reliably one-shot apps like Winamp or iTunes in a few words from a layperson with no programming background. These are the ideas the hype machine is putting in people’s minds that seem detached from reality. I don’t think the, “you’re holding it wrong”, type responses are a good defense. It’s more that it’s being marketed wrong, because all these companies need to maintain the hype to keep raising money. When people use the AI the way the hype tells them it should work… it doesn’t work. reply",

          "text": "I don't think that's true, I've seen examples to the contrary. Here for example a recent article [1] from a non programmer building a tool. The article is long so I pasted the relevant part below. My thoughts go more in the direction, the article author built something that is complicated for non technical people, but in essence simple -- he says it so himself \"copy paste\". What if what the OP here is building is something novel and Claude doesn't know how to build it? Relevant excerpt: I spent a bit of time last month building a site to solve a problem I’ve always found super-annoying about the legislative process. It’s hard to read Federal bills because they don’t map to the underlying code. Anyone who has worked in Congress knows what I mean, you get a bill that says “change this word from ‘may’ to ‘shall’ in section XYZ of Federal law.” To understand what it does, and find possible loopholes they are trying to sneak in, you have to go to that underlying Federal law and look at where it says “may” and then put “shall” in there and read it. It’s basically like a manual version of copy and pasting, except much more complicated and with lawyers trying to trick you. So I wrote an app that lets you upload legislation, and it automatically shows you how it changes Federal law. There are commercial versions of this software, and some states do it for their proposed legislation. But I haven’t seen anything on the Federal level that is free, so I built it. (The code is here.) It’s not very good. It’ll probably break a lot. There’s no “throat to choke” if you use it and it’s wrong. And my guess is that Anthropic or Gemini ultimately will be able to do this function itself eventually. But the point is that if I can build something like this in my spare time and deploy it without any training at all, then it’s just not that hard for an organization with some capital to get rid of some of its business software tools.

The assumption was that using common 3D printer measurement tools (like for bed-leveling) would provide a way to read back whatever data was encoded onto the surface.<p>Since that seems like a pretty well-known concept, crudely applied to a domain I haven't seen it in before - but is already large and growing fast - I'm assuming that others have thought of this? I was hoping maybe someone had implemented something like it?\nAnd then, obviously, if that proof of concept exists, I'd wonder about some kind of advanced version that used specialized equipment for the reading (and possibly the writing/printing).<p>In any case, I'm just curious. I was thinking about long term (century +) archival storage, or encryption keys only stored as the print with no digital copies. Stuff that wouldn't need tons of storage, but would be crucial to maintain statically. It probably wouldn't be useful for that, which is why I assume I'm not finding much in my searches for it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew about it, in case there is stuff it's good for.</p></p></div>",

Exotics like laser engraved metal plates or ceramics might be better if you have a lot of data and can’t guarantee your storage will be fire and flood free. If you don’t have a lot of data you can also think of engraving it into stone or press it into a clay tablet and fire it. These mediums are known to be very stable even in adverse circumstances. reply",

But... is anyone doing that with a 3D printer? Or a CNC machine, for that matter? I think some of the other answered showed that people are, it's just pretty niche.

This is him trying to FOMO listeners into using his project. From what I've observed, the people trying to use herds of agents to work on different things at the same time are just using tokens as fast as possible because they think more tokens means more progress. As you scale up the sub-agents you spend so much time managing the herd and trying to backtrack when things go wrong that you would have been better off handling it serially with yourself in the loop. If you don't have someone else paying the bill for unlimited token usage it's going to be a very expensive experiment. reply",

Especially with the latest models which pack quite a long and meaningful horizon into a single session, if you prompt diligently for what exactly you want it to do. Modern agentic coding spins up its own sub-agents when it makes sense to parallelize. It's just not as sexy as typing a sentence and letting your AI bill go BRR (and then talking about it). I'd like to see some actual results with a meaningful benchmark of software output that shows that agent orchestrators accomplish any meaningful improvement in the state of the art of software engineering, other than spending more tokens.

A lot of the safety guardrails we need don't even exist yet. I'm working on all that currently. Trying to set up local systems to do practical and secure orchestrated AI work, without over-reliance on proprietary systems and platforms. Turns out it's a buttload of work. Yegge's own project (Gas Town) is a real world attempt to build just the agent part, and still many more parts are needed. It's so complicated, I don't think any open source solution is going to become dominant, because there's  too much to integrate. The company that perfects this is going to be the next GitHub and Heroku rolled into one. I get why people question all this. It's a completely different way of working that flies in the face of every best practice and common-sense lesson you learn as a software developer. But once you wrap your head around it, it makes total sense. You don't need to read code to know a system works and is reliable. You don't need to manually inspect the quality of things if there's other ways to establish trust. Work gets done a lot faster with automation, ironically with fewer errors. You can use cutting-edge technology to improve safety and performance, and ship faster. These aren't crazy hypothetical ideals - what I just described is  modern auto manufacturing. If it's safe enough for a car, it's safe enough for a web app. reply",

The best pattern I've seen: give each agent clear module boundaries (not file-level, but architectural). Think micro-services even in a monolith. Then each agent owns its domain end-to-end.

          "text": "I stopped manually writing code 6-9mo ago, and am generating high-quality code on the dimensions we care about like GPU perf benchmarks, internal & industry conformance standards test suites, evals benchmarks, lint/type checkers, etc. It's not perfect code - there are clear AI slop tell tales that review cycles still let linger - but it's doing more ambitious things than we'd do on most dimensions like capability, quality, and volume. We're solving years-old GPU bugs that we had given up on as mere mortals. And yes, we build our own orchestrator tech, both as our product (not vibes coding but vibes investigating), and more relevant here, our internal tooling. For example, otel & evals increasingly drive our AI coding loops rather than people. Codex and claude code are great agentic coding harnesses, so our 'custom orchestration' work is more about more intelligently using them in richer pipelines, like the above eval-driven loop. They've been pretty steadily adding features like parallel subagents that work in teams, and hookable enough to do most tricks, that I don't feel the need to use others. We're busy enough adapting on our own! reply",

Just use the \"ultra\" power saving mode your current phone has. It's not a fully universal advise, but usually it will make your screen turn grayscale, disable background services, replace your launcher with a much simpler one and then allow you to add 3-5 apps to use. On my phones it's configurable (like, you can keep colors, etc). You can still use 5G and read email, use an IM. But you have to prioritize and your notifications are severely limited. I personally consolidated all mail to Thunderbird mobile which checks mail every 3-4 hours only and it had zero impact on me (I can always refresh manually if I need to confirm login email etc). reply",

Today, it's not possible (for me.) Authentication is a big part of it. My (web) access to my bank demands a selfie photo on my phone. Plus endless other systems. Outside of work, all communications is via WhatsApp. I pretty much don't even read SMS's anymore. They're 99% spam or scam. And it's not just person to person, all social activities from church to sport to band etc are all on WhatsApp. I use maps only a couple times a year, but when I need it, I really need it (cause I'm not where I expected to be.) I don't do social media, or email, on the phone. Both if which frankly lead to problems in some situations. I'm traveling this year and the number of tickets (train and museum) that can only be used from a phone is impressive. I applud your desire to remove the phone from your life, especially if you are distracted by it. But you may find that it's hard to do. I'm not interested in \"work arounds\", I want to get stuff done, not fight everything about my life. So I recommend, get a dumb phone and use that.

          "text": "Maybe think about what it was like before they were everywhere. Peoples' recollections might not be that accurate, and watching old TV shows may not help much, but think what it means to you and how you would thrive like so many people did and many still can. Now with the smartest of phones you can put your communication on steroids and do more other things by far, but just because you can doesn't mean you should. I never even got a cellphone until I had been in business for over a year, then it was only because I wanted clients to be able to reach me 24/7.  Decades ago they were already popular but not really common yet. When I got my first smartphone they were still monochrome and just got you on the internet as a wireless dial-up modem, connecting by the built-in IR sensors to your laptop's little port before there was USB which became available in later years. And it was pretty good because it was usually way faster than 56K, which most people didn't even get when they had a premium land-line modem. But it was also pretty expensive by the minute so only useful when there was just no landline available. So it's quite easy for me to refrain because I'm old enough to remember how it was before these were even here. Eventually I had a Sony smartphone in the flip-phone format which was way more capable than the iPhone was, but it was decades and calls and text were still enough to keep me busy so I never had time for any apps on the small screen, especially when I was long used to having the full internet on my x86 laptop whenever I want. I kept my final Sony-Ericsson as long as could, and one of the nicest features was it was not Android nor iOS, but eventually all its frequencies were discontinued. So got a run-of-the-mill touchphone not that many years ago for the first time, and Android is worse than I thought. The experience is so \"rewarding\" that it's even easier reverting to how it was before there were even cellphones at all, which I also remember well. So most of the time it doesn't even come with me, just leave it sitting there on the desk at home or office and mainly carry it in between, or in a vehicle if I'm going to be gone a long time. Touchphones are so bulky (and delicate) compared to everything I was accustomed to, that it's a drag to carry around anyway, and ends up more so than ever, without planning, back to serving more like a good old land line stuck to the desk than anything else. So that's the switch I made and it was no effort at all, just let nature take its course :) reply",

You then take a photo of the cracked bone and feed it back to your coding agent, which has been properly trained in interpreting Oracle Bones to extract PR review comments. If the PR is too big too fit on the bone, you reject it for being too big. If after three rounds of review the bones keep cracking in the same spot, reject the PR.

          "text": "So before the gate keeping starts, my first crack at optimizations was in 1987 on a 1 MHz Apple //e 1. I wrote the code in BASIC 2. I wrote the code in assembly 3. I got more improvement because storing and reading from the first page of memory took two clock cycles instead of 3. But this isn’t 1986, this is 2026. I “vibe coded” my first project this year.  I designed the AWS architecture from the an empty account using IAC, I chose every service to use, I verified every permission,  I chose and designed the orchestration, the concurrency model, I gathered requirements.  What I didn’t do is look at a line of Python code or infrastructure code aside from the permissions that Codex generated. Now to answer your questions : How did I validate the correctness? Just like if I had written it myself.  I had Codex to create a shell script to do end to end tests of all of the scenarios I cared about and when one broke, I went back to Codex to fix it. I was very detailed about the scenarios. The web front end that I used was built by another developer.  I haven’t touched web dev in a decade. I told Codex what changes I needed and I verified the changes by deploying it and testing it manually. How did I validate the performance? Again just like I would do on something I wrote.  I tested it first with a few hundred  transactions to verify the  functionality and then I stress tested it with a real world amount a transactions.  The first iteration broke horribly.  Not because of Claude code.  It was a bad design. But here’s the beauty.  It took me a day to do the bad implementation that would have taken me three or four days.  I then redesigned it, didn’t use the AWS service and did I designed that was much more scalable and it took a day.  I knew in theory how it worked under the hood.  But not in practice.  Again I tested for scalability by testing the result. The architectural quality? I validated it by synthesizing real world traffic.  ChatGPT in thinking mode did find a subtle concurrency bug.  That was my fault though.  I designed the concurrency implementation, Codex just did what I told it to do. Subtle bugs happen whether people write it or an agent writes it.  You do the best you can with your tests and when they come up you fix it? How do I prevent technical debt? All large implementations have technical debt. Again just like when I lead a team - I componenitize everything with clean interfaces.  It makes it easier for coding agents and people. reply",

It can explain topics in more detail, or it can tell you that the thing you asked will be explained later in the book. And it will allow you to skip material that you are already familiar with. Provide references to other resources, etc.<p>Maybe ingesting an entire book is too much for current LLMs, but I'm sure there are ways around that.<p>Note: I am __not__ trying to build such a tool myself.</p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It seems like we are in the midst of another AI hype cycle. Many people are calling the current coding models an \"inflection point\", where now the capabilities are so high that future model growth will be explosive. I have heard serious people, like economics writer Noah Smith, make this argument [0].<p>But it's not just the commentariat. I have seen very serious people in software engineering and tech talk about the ways in which their coding habits have change drastically.<p>Benchmarks [1] alone don't seem to capture everything, although there have been jumps in the agentic sections, so maybe they actually do.<p>My question is; what explains these big jumps in capabilities that many serious people seem to be noticing all at once? Is it simply that we have thrown enough data and compute at the models, or instead, are labs perhaps fine-tuning models to get really good at tool calls, which leads to this new, surprising behavior?<p>When I explain agents to people, I usually walk them through a manual task one might go through when debugging code. You copy some code into ChatGPT, it asks you for more context, you copy some more code in, it suggests and edit, you edit and run, there is an error, so you paste that in, and so on. An agent is just an LLM in that loop which can use tools to do those things automatically. It would not be shocking to me if we took weaker models like Claude Opus 4.0 and made it 10x better at tool calls, it would be a much stronger and more impressive model. But is that all that is happening, or am I missing something big?<p>[0] https://substack.com/@noahpinion/p-187818379<p>[1] https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "> Model T to 2026 Camry was an amazing shift without really changing the combustion engine. A lot of times the big jumps in internal combustion engine development have been down to materials science or manufacturing capability improvement. The underlying thermodynamics and theoretical limits have not changed, but the individual parts and what we make it out of have steadily improved over time. The other factor to this is the need for emissions reduction strategies as a overriding design factor. The analogue to these two in LLMs are: 1. The harnesses and agentic systems-focused training has gotten better over time so performance has increased without a step change in the foundation models. 2. The requirements for guardrails and anti-prompt injection and other concepts to make LLMs palatable for use by consumers and businesses. reply",

          "text": "This is why the saying has always been “reduce, reuse, recycle” in that order. Reducing is the best. Don’t buy or make surplus stuff, and that reduces waste overall. Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible. Installing Linux on an old laptop to keep it useful for somebody is easy to do, and much more effective than trying to recycle it. reply",

For example, is the legislation you're thinking of like the deprecation of plastic bags for paper? Or something that covers a much wider amount of consumption? (C) If (A) is \"yes\" or (B) is \"more global\", at huge scales like an economy, legislating quotas or rationing or anything at all, in practice pushes activity onto black markets.

          "text": "In addition to the volume issue, there's the composition issue.  When I was a kid, we recycled all our flint cores.  Well, not quite that far back...  Milk came in glass bottles, and the person who delivered the bottles of milk to our house picked up the empties to take back to the dairy.  There were also steel cans for canned food and soft drinks (which eventually rusts away), and of course lots of other glass bottles.  Now more and more of those kinds of things come in plastic, of which little gets recycled.  And cans are often aluminum, which doesn't rust away. Furniture was wood and fabric and (maybe) springs, with a little bit of pressboard (which was itself recycled paper and textile, usually used on the back of desks etc.).  Now furniture is particleboard (made from sawdust), with lots of glue and some kind of plastic veneer if it's in a place that shows.  Wood is genuinely recyclable (or re-usable as antiques!); I don't think particleboard is recyclable, although I could be wrong. Automobiles were steel, fabric, glass and copper wire (with rubber insulation); plus of course rubber tires.  Now they are those things plus a lot more plastic.  Tires, both then and now, are essentially un-recyclable (although occasionally turned into artificial reefs). I could go on, but there are probably more authoritative (= better) studies of this.  But I suspect in general that we have lots less recyclable \"stuff\" these days than we used to. reply",

          "text": "The ultimate reason is there isn't economic reason so.  It cost's a lot to recycle anything, and most electronics would net you almost nothing valuable. Let's look at an example.  Let's say your phones main board, which will net a few hundred grams of raw materials.  First thing by weight the actual board itself is probably the biggest,  if you could perfectly decompose it to it's parts you would have some fiberglass, glue, a few grams of copper, and maybe a trace amount of gold. Next you would have the different components, mostly ICs but let's cover them next.  These are mostly plastic with bits of copper, tin, and other more exotic metals. Most of these could be used again, if you can separate them and sort them.  There would be a bunch of solder, which maybe could be reused, if you remix it with more flux.  Finally, you'll have chips, these could be reused, but only as replacements for the same chip.  Getting anything out of these would mostly be removing the bulk of the material which is silicon that's been contaminated with other elements to make the semiconductors.  I don't think there is any process right now that could take doped Si and get you anything back.  Besides the silicon you have micrograms of gold and other conductors. Having put all that down, I think there could be an opportunity to take the bulk components off boards, test and sort them, and sell them in bulk. reply",

Many times the only viable option to fix something is to swap a board, or replace the entire item, instead of replacing the one failed component that caused the board to fail, or reflowing the board etc.. Many components also do not offer batteries that can be replaced, such as the magic mouse, so you end up needing to replace the entire item. It's interesting how as certain things age, such as cars, cottage industries pop up to do just that when new replacement boards and parts are not available. The other issue is cost cutting. Many components are made cheaply and fail pre-maturely. Great examples of this are mains voltage LED bulbs where the rectifier circuits that power the LED's fail, but the only real option is to replace the entire thing, creating a lot of e-waste in the process. reply",

I think we're better off lobbying for better standards to communicate the quality of a bulb's design.  The whole reason we have crappy LED bulbs to begin with is because the $3 overdriven bulb with crap components jammed into a tiny enclosure looks like a better deal on the shelf than a bulky $20 bulb with a large heat sink and lower output. And the labor required to do component level repair is wildly expensive and limited (YouTubers who do it on principle notwithstanding), even further narrowing that window. reply",

Not that I think lightbulbs are probably worth saving, but expand it to any other device which gets exponentially more complex and it is easy to see why they don't get diagnosed, not to mention repaired. With a board diagram I can point at a spot on the board and say \"I should see 15 volts here\", without a board diagram i gotta draw out and figure out how the power supply even works so I know what it is suppose to be outputting and then trace that all the way to the test point to make sure there isn't other crap inline before then that might change what I see. reply",

If it is cheap to replace, they will just get a new one.  If it was a big investment, then it's important enough to call a professional to fix.  In the middle ground you've got people who will ask their handy nephew to try to fix it before they run out to the store, and he'll open it up and look for a blown fuse or a loose wire before giving up.  The type of people who can do board level repairs are so rare as to be completely irrelevant to the waste stream of electronics.

Appliance repair use to be big business. Did it stop being so because washers and TVs and vacuums became too complicated to understand, or the parts went up in cost, or because $1000 is considered cheap enough of a device to be considered disposable? No. They stopped existing because appliances stopped coming with the reference materials to repair them in a reasonable time and parts are obfuscated from their source so people don't even know what their broken part is half the time. Is that a thermistor, a capacitor, a diode that blew up? Have fun spending the next 2 hours tracing the obfuscated part number down through 5 different suppliers to figure it out because you obviously can't test a broken part and there is no schematic to look at and identify it from. reply",

They have fewer mechanical parts prone to regular failure or which pay the bills for repair shops (belts, timers, etc) 4. They are far more complicated than their predecessors, and therefore more complicated to diagnose even if you have a schematic But yeah, when everyone’s washing machine has a belt transmission and a clunky mechanical timer, they failed all the time and there were repair shops on every corner.

          "text": "There was a cartel, but this is one of those \"more complicated than it appears\" situations. In incandescent bulbs, there is a real tradeoff between durability of the bulb, efficiency (lumens/watt), and brightness/quality of the light, for physics reasons you _can't_ improve one without degrading the other. Since \"quality of light\" is a very difficult thing to market, there was an incentive to push \"lifetime of the bulb\" in marketing and just make the light quality increasingly worse. The cartel attempted to halt that by making everyone agree on a lifetime/quality to hit and not participate in a race to the bottom (and yes, there was also the obvious benefit to the cartel members of increased sales and profits, which they explicitly talked about in internal documents). I want to be very clear that I'm anti cartels and I'm not trying to say \"so this was all hunky dory\", just that this was not (and these things very rarely are) a simple case of \"they made the product objectively worse for the sole sake of more money\". Instead, they chose a different point on the pareto-frontier of brightness/efficiency/lifespan that also had the benefit of making them more money. But yes, LED bulbs are currently mostly garbage and have terrible heat/power management electronics which means that in practice you almost never get anywhere close to the theoretical life span increases (because the electronics die from overheating far before the actual LEDs themselves would go out), and finding out information on how well a given bulb brand does on heat/power management is essentially impossible. reply",

The obvious Nash Equilibrium involves increasingly hot/bright/efficient bulbs and as much lying about lifetime as a typical consumer would accept, which is a lot. The idea behind the Phoebus Cartel was to force honesty on the dimension where it was most likely to disappear. You are free to disapprove of this and reject bulb lifetime policing, but if so you support the \"everybody lies\" alternative. Pick your poison. reply",

The truth is that they become hazardous waste, and lock away valuable resources inside of trash. The reality is that there is no real economic benefit to the current model of ever increasing sales of new goods.

Electronics are the exact opposite of this: they’re highly heterogenous, with bits of material scattered all over the place. Also, most of that material isn’t particularly valuable: silicon is literally as abundant as sand. So all you can really do is melt it all into slag or dissolve it in acid and then try to extract the trace amounts of valuable bits like gold, but this is so energy-intensive for so little material that it’s not worth it at any reasonable material price. reply",

      "title": "Ask HN: We're building a saving app for European savers and need GTM advice",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN, I'm Alessandro, founder of unflat.finance. We're an Italian startup building a stablecoin yield app for everyday Europeans people who have never touched a wallet, don't know what Morpho is, and have no interest in learning.<p>What we do today: Users deposit euros via cooinbase pay. We convert to USDC, split their deposit across multiple isolated Morpho vaults on Base chain (each with different collateral types and borrowers pledging 150-200% of what they receive), and they earn 4-7% APY. They see one number: their balance growing daily. No wallet, no gas fees, no tokens. We have apps built for both iOS and Android, currently in beta.<p>The market context: This category is exploding in the US. Axal (a16z CSX, $2.5M), Nook (Coinbase Ventures, $2.5M, ~7.6% avg APY, built by ex-Coinbase/Uber team), YieldClub ($2.5M), and Aave itself launched a consumer savings app with up to 9% APY and $1M deposit protection. They're all live or in waitlist. They all run on the same proven infrastructure (Morpho has had $8.5B in peak deposits, 25+ audits, backed by $69M from a16z and Coinbase Ventures, used by Société Générale).<p>But they're all US-first. ACH, Plaid, Apple Pay, USD-denominated. Europe 350M+ banking customers sitting at near-zero rates — has no equivalent. In the US you can get 4-5% at Marcus or Wealthfront. In Europe, most banks pay 0.5% or less. The yield gap here is wider, and nobody is serving it.<p>That's our bet. We're also working on EURc (Circle's euro stablecoin) integration so the entire flow stays euro-denominated — no FX exposure. That's something no US competitor can replicate.<p>What we want to build next: An AI agent that automates portfolio allocation based on each user's risk profile. You answer a few questions about risk tolerance, time horizon, goals the agent handles vault selection, rebalancing, entry/exit across DeFi strategies. Think Wealthfront/Betterment for crypto, not another trading bot. The multi-vault architecture on Morpho makes this natural: different risk profiles map to different vault compositions.<p>Where I need help:<p>Go-to-market for non-crypto users in Europe: Our target is the person with €10-50K in a savings account earning nothing, not crypto Twitter degens. Every crypto marketing channel attracts the wrong audience. We're running a waitlist with tiered bonuses (+2% APY for first 500 users, referral bonuses), but how do you actually reach normal savers? Has anyone cracked fintech distribution in Europe without burning cash on Meta/Google ads (which are restricted for crypto anyway)?<p>Driving traffic to the site: SEO/GEO is slow, content marketing takes months to compound, paid ads for crypto are a minefield. What's actually moved the needle for early-stage fintech in Europe? We're bootstrapped, so capital-efficient channels matter.<p>Trust for non-crypto users: We lead with radical transparency — every user gets a public on-chain link showing every deposit, earning, and withdrawal. We put risk disclaimers front and center (\"this is not a bank account, never deposit what you can't afford to lose\"). But is that enough? What trust signals actually convert skeptical Europeans?<p>The stablecoin savings app category is being defined right now. YC literally listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest Requests for Startups. We think Europe is the bigger opportunity — the yield gap is wider and nobody's building here yet. Would love to hear from anyone who's built in this space.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Nobody using our product needs to know what a blockchain is. They see a savings account with a better rate that's it.\nMeanwhile: Stripe acquired Bridge for $1.1B for stablecoin rails. Société Générale is building on Morpho. Coinbase routes lending through it. YC just started offering checks in stablecoins and listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest RFS.\nThis isn't \"crypto\" anymore. It's on-chain finance the same way \"the internet\" stopped being a category and became invisible plumbing. European banks pay 0.5%. Overcollateralized on-chain lending pays 4-7%. That spread exists because banks capture the margin. We remove the middleman.\nThe people who \"want to stop the insanity\" are exactly our users. They don't want crypto. They want their savings to not lose value. We just use better rails. reply",

It now has a working slider, but the landscape/portrait is still broken.<p>4th try, it manages to fix the landscape/portrait issue, but now the issue is that the controls are behind the display so I have to reload the page.<p>5th try, it manages to fix this issue, but now it is squished again.<p>6th try, I ask it to try again from scratch. This time it gives me a syntax error.<p>This is so frustrating.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The truth is that there is a lot of hype. You need to be reasonably experienced and guide it. First, you need to know that Claude will create nonsensical code. On a macro level it's not exactly smart it just has a lot of contextual static knowledge. Debugging is not it's strongest skill. Most models don't do good at all. Opus is able to one-shot \"troubleshooting\" prompts occasionally, but it's a high probability that it veer of on a tangent if you just tell it to \"fix things\" based on errors or descriptions. You need to have an idea what you want fixed. Another problem is that it can create very convincing looking - but stupid - code. If you can't guide it, that's almost guaranteed. It can create code that's totally backwards and overly complicated. If it IS going on a wrong tangent, it's often hopeless to get it back on track. The conversation and context might be polluted. Restart and reframe the prompt and the problems at hand and try again. I'm not totally sure about the language you are using, but syntax errors typically happens if it \"forgets\" to update some of the code, and very seldom just in a single file or edit. I like to create a design.md and think a bit on my own, or maybe prompt to create it with a high level problem to get going, and make sure it's in the context (and mentioned in the prompts) reply",

While this may be possible, it likely requires a very detailed prompt and/or spec document. --- Here is an example of something I successfully built with Claude: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app Apparently I have had over 150 chat sessions related to the research and development of this tool. - First, we wrote a spec together: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-transcription/blob/main/spec... - The spec broke down development into major phases. I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting. And after implementation, I often had to have Claude fix bugs in the implementation. - I tried to share the chat session where Claude got the first functional MVP working: https://opncd.ai/share/fXsPn1t1 (unfortunately the shared session is truncated) --- \"AI mistakes you're probably making\": https://youtu.be/Jcuig8vhmx4 I think the most relevant point is: AI is best for accelerating development tasks you could do on your own; not new tasks you don't know how to do. --- Finally: Cloudlflare builds OAuth with Claude and publishes all the prompts: https://hw.leftium.com/#/item/44159166 reply",

Like a custom python websocket server: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-local (I also implemented the previous version with only a high-level, basic understanding of websockets: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app/sherpa ) I think of Claude like a \"force-multiplier.\" I have been able to implement ideas I previously gave up on. I can test out new ideas much faster. For example, https://github.com/Leftium/gg started out as 100% hand-crafted code. I wanted gg to be able to print out the expression in the code in addition to the value like python icecream. (It's more useful to get both the value and the variable name/expression.) I previously tried, and gave up. Claude helped me add this feature within a few hours. And now gg has its own virtual dev console optimized for interacting with coding agents. A very useful feature that I would probaly not have attempted without Claude. It's taken the \"open in editor\" feture to a completely new level. I have implemented other features that I would have never attempted or even thought about. For example without Claud's assistance https://ws.leftium.com would not have many features like the animated background that resembles the actual sky color. 60 minute forecast was on my TODO list for a long time. Claude helped me add it within an afternoon or so. Note: depending on complexity of the feature I want to add the spec varies in the level of detail.

You can one-shot some things, and it makes for an impressive demo (oh yay, yet another video game made instantly) but anything larger and more useful will probably be a conversation. (Though not necessarily with a human, AIs can discuss it among themselves too.) Your first one-shot might be a good rough prototype. From there, you continue the conversation with your refinements. While Claude goes and works on that for 15 minutes - you can go and do other work. Or talk with another Claude in another window to make progress on another project. A good mental model is to imagine you're talking to a remote developer. You need to give them an extremely detailed spec on the first go if you expect them to get it right the first time. Sometimes it's better to explain \"this is my grand vision, but how about we first mockup a prototype to see if that's actually how I want it to work\". Sometimes Claude will suggest you talk about your plan together first to remove the ambiguities from the plan, or you can encourage Claude to do that with you. (Also, the remote developer mindset is useful - treat the remote developer with respect, with humanity, and they're more likely to be helpful towards you and motivated to align with your goals.) Consider that in an hour or two of conversation, you now have your app, completed, fully debugged... and not once did you look at the code, and you spent half of that time catching up on your other tasks.

          "text": "Well, I've offered what I can to help. If your experience is mostly free chatbots, I would definitely suggest trying Opus 4.5 or 4.6 in Claude Code. The agentic harness of the software around the model (ie Claude Code) is important. Consider also that some of us have been doing this for a year and have already built our own MCP server tooling to go faster. Giving your AI the same kind of deterministic software tools that you use is important (eg make sure your AI has access to a diff tool, don't make it try and do that \"in its head\", you wouldn't ask that of a human). As for listening to Hacker News... yeah, this is one of the worst places (well, Mastodon is worse) and HN is surprisingly AI-doomerish. I don't check in here very often anymore, and as of this week I just get Claude to summarize HN headlines as a morning podcast for me instead. My own experience: my first few uses of Claude in Dec 2024 seemed rubbish, I didn't get it. Then one day I asked it to make me a search engine. The one shot from that wasn't perfect, but it worked, and I saw it build it in front of my eyes. That was the moment & I kept iterating on it. I haven't used Google or Kagi in almost a year now. Anyway, hope it helps, but if not using AI makes you feel more comfortable, go with what fills your life with more value & meaning & enjoyment. reply",

I don't crawl or spider, I focus on indexing from sitemap.xml files and RSS feeds. I have about 1.5 Million pages in my local index, and I get search results in 40ms - 70ms, thereabouts. For every search that doesn't find results - and of course that's still the majority - it falls back to a meta-search combining results from Brave, Mojeek & Marginalia. The core of that metasearch is what Claude 3.5v2 generated for me in a one-shot back in Dec 2024. Kagi is just a metasearch with a very small local index as well, and my main purpose in building this was replacing Kagi for my needs. The last 10% of my queries were widget queries like currency conversion, distance & temperature conversion etc that I was using for about 10% of my search queries. reply",

That is a very wrong approach, not just with Claude but with everything(you ask a woman for a date and if you do not get laid in five minutes you failed?). When I program something manually and compiles, I expect it to be wrong. You have to iron it and debug it. Instead of that: 1.Divide the work in independent units. I call this \"steps\" 2.Subdivide steps into \"subsets\"\nYou work in an isolated manner on those subsets. 3.Use an inmediate gui interface like dear imgui to prototype your tool. Translating then into using something else once it works is quite easy of LLMs. 4.Visualize everything. You do not need to see the code but you need to visualise every single thing you ask it to do. 5.Tell Claude what you want and why you want it and update the documentation constantly. 6. Use git in order to make rock solid steps that Claude will not touch when it works and you can revert changes or ask the ia to explore a branch, explaining how you did something and want something similar. 7. Do not modify code that already works rock solid. Copy it into another step leaving the step as reference and modify it there. 5.Use logs. Lots of logs. For every step you create text logs and you debug the problems giving Claude the logs to read them. 6.Use screenshots. Claude can read screenshots. If you visualise everything, clause can see the errors too. 7.Use asserts, lots of asserts, just like with manual programming. It is not that different from managing a real team of people... reply",

When doing it yourself, you can make decisions in the moment, try things, pivot… when trying to delegate these things, it becomes a chore to try to clarify things that are inherently unclear, and pivot an idea when the person (or AI) being delegated to doesn’t fully grasp the pivot and keeps bringing in old ideas.

That’s how it feels to use AI. reply",

Last night I added an archive to the Daily Challenge mode, so if you missed a day's challenge you could go back and play it. This is what my initial prompt looked like: --- I'd like to add an archives mode to the daily challenge. This will allow players to complete any daily challenges they didn't attempt on the actual day. It will look like a calendar, with the dates in Green if it was played, and in white if not. The archive should only go back to January 30, 2026, the day the project started. Include a to do to change this date prior to release. Rewards for completing daily challenges via the archive should be 25% of the normal value. --- Claude Code then asked me a couple of clarifying questions before it harnessed the superpowers:writing-plans skill and generate a document to plan the work. The document it put together is viewable at https://gist.github.com/Jeremy1026/cee66bf6d4b67d9a527f6e30f... There were a couple of edits that I made to the document before I told it to implement. It then fired off a couple of agents to perform the tasks in parallel where possible. Once it finished I tested and it worked as I had hoped. But there was a couple of follow up things that would make it more intertwined with everything else going on around daily challenges. So I followed up with: --- lets give 1 cell for compelting an archived daily challenge --- And finally: --- Now that we are tracking completions, can we update the notification to complete daily mission to include \"Keep your X day streak\" --- reply",

          "text": "Another example is the tower stat caps. When Claude Code generate the first pass, it make it so that the tower level would control each individual stat's cap. Which was way too high. I didn't know exactly what the limits were, but knew they needed to be pulled back some. So I asked it: -Start Prompt- Currently, a towers level sets the maximum a single stat can be. Can you tell me what those stat caps are? -End Prompt- This primed the context to have information about the stat caps and how they are tied to levels. I followed up after it gave me a chart back with Tower Level and Max Stat Rank with some real stats from play -Start Prompt- Lets change the stat cap, the caps are currently far too high. All towers start at 1 for each IMPACT stat, my oldest tower is Level 5, and its stats are I-3, M-4, P-6, A-3, C-1, T-1. How do you think I could go about reducing the cap in a meaningful way. -End Prompt- It came back with a solution to reduce the individual stat cap for individual stats to be tower level + 1. But I felt that was too limiting. I want players to be able to specialize a tower so I told it have the stat cap be total, not per stat. -Start Prompt- I'm thinking about having a total stat cap, so in this towers case, the total stats are 18. -End Prompt- It generated a couple of structures of how the cap could increase and presented them to me. -Start Prompt- Yes, it would replace the per-stat cap entirely. If a player wants to specialize a tower in one stat using the entire cap that is fine. Lets do 10 + (rank * 3), that will give the user a little bit of room to train a new tower. Since it's a total stat cap, if a user is training and the tower earns enough stat xp to level beyond the cap, lock the tower at max XP for that stat, and autoamtically level the stat when the user levels up the tower. -End Prompt- It added the cap, but introduced a couple of build errors, so I sent it just the build errors. -Start Prompt- /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerDetailView.swift:231:39 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'tower' is a 'let' constant /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerEditorView.swift:181:47 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'towerInstance' is a 'let' constant -End Prompt- And thus, a new stat cap system was implemented. reply",

It doesn’t work that way (not well, at least) The LLM under the hood is essentially a very fancy autocomplete. This always needs to be kept in mind when working with these tools. So you have to focus a lot on what the source text is that’s going to be used to produce the completion. The better the source text, the better the completion. In other words, you need to make sure you progressively fill the context window with stuff that matters for the task that you’re doing. In particular, first explore the problem space with the tool (iterate), then use the exploration results to plan what needs doing (iterate), when the plan looks good and makes sense, only then you ask to actually implement. Claude’s built in planning mode kind of does this, but in my opinion it sucks. It doesn’t make iterating on the exploration and the plan easy or natural. So I suggest just setting up some custom prompts (skills) for this with instructions that make sense for the particular domain/use case, and use those in the normal mode. reply",

Opus is the first model that actually convinced me to use AI as my daily driver - and I’m a developer for about 20 years.\n2. Make the tasks as small and specific as possible. Don’t prompt „create a todo app with user login“ but „create a vue app where users can register, don’t do more than that“, then „build a user  login“ then, „create a page to create todo items“, then „create a page to list todo items“, then „on list page, add delete functionality“ - and so on, you get the idea.\n3. beware the context size. Claude code will warn you if you exceed it, but even before: the higher the context window, the higher AI will miss things. If you start a new prompt that doesn’t require the whole context of the previous one, type /clear. \n4. build an agents.md or Claude.md. /init will do that for you, but it will just create a Claude.md with information that it might think are important - but easily miss things. You know best. It often also includes file and directory structure, while it could easily find out again (tree command) without that info in agents/claude file. Still I recommend: let Claude create that file, then adjust it to your needs. Only add important stuff here. The more you add, the more you spam the context. Again, try to keep context small. \n5. if Claude needs a long time for finishing a task or did it wrong at first attempt, tell it to update the Claude.md with information to not do the same mistakes the next time again.\n6. make sure you understand the code it created. Add conventions to agents.md that will make the code more readable (use early returns, don‘t exceed nesting level of 3, create new methods with meaningful names instead of inline comments etc.) Good luck! reply",

There are 3 major steps: (Plan mode) 1. assuming this is an existing codebase, load the relevant docs/existing code into context (usually by typing @<PATH> 2. Ask it to make a plan for the feature you want to implement. Assuming you’ve already put some thought into this, be as specific and detailed as you can. Ask it to build a plan that’s divided into individually variable steps. Read the plan file that it spits out, correct and bad assumptions it made, ask it questions if you’re unclear one what it’s saying, refine, etc. (agent mode)\nAsk it to build the plan, one step at a time. After it builds each step  verify that it’s correct, or have it help you verify it’s correct in a way you can observe. I have been following this basic process mostly with Opus 4.5 in a mixture of claude code and cursor working on a pretty niche image processing pipeline (also some advanced networking stuff on the side) and have hand-written basically zero code. People say - “your method sounds like a lot of work too” and that’s true, it is still work, but designing at a high level how I want some CUDA kernel to work and how it fits into the wider codebase and then describing it in a few sentences is still much faster than doing all of the above anyway and then hand writing 100 lines of CUDA (which I don’t know that well). I’d conservatively estimate that i’ve made 2x the progress in the same amount of time as if I had been doing this without LLM tools. reply",

There are some small things it never has managed to fix that I have to figure out myself, but again, I learn from that. Mapping out a data structure in advance and creating a plan before immediately coding can also help, but at least in our project, sometimes it just takes an incorrect approach and so I don't just let it go off and do things willy-nilly.

          "text": "First of all, congratulations on asking this question, it seems that everyone is an AI expert these days and it takes courage to admit you're not one of them (neither am I or most of of everyone). In my little experience, what I've seen work is that you need to provide a lot of constraints in the form of: - Scope: Don't build a website, but build a feature (either user facing or infra, it doesn't matter). I've found that chunking my prompts in human-manageable tasks that would take 0.5-1 day, is enough of a scale down. - Docs .md files that describe how the main parts of the application work, what a component/module/unit of code looks like, what tools&technologies to use (and links to the latest documentation and quickstart pages). You should commit these to code and update them with every code change (which with Claude is just a reminder in each prompt). - Existing code, if it's not a greenfield project. It really moves away from the advertised paradigm of one-shot vibe-coding but since the quality of the output is really good these days, this long preparation will give you a production ready output much sooner than with traditional methods. reply",

This reminds me of someone who dropped into  #java on undernet once upon a time in the 90s. \"I can't get it to work\" , and we kept trying to debug, and for some reason we kept hitting random new walls. It just never would work!    Turns out that they were deleting their .java file and starting over each time.  Don't do that. --- Take it as a sequence of exercises. Maybe start like this: Don't use claude code at all to begin with. It's a pair programming exercise, and you start at the keyboard, where you're confident and in control. Have claude open in the web interface alongside, talk through the design with it while working; and ask to google stuff for you, look up the api, maybe ask if it remembers the best way(s) to approach the problem. Once you trust it a bit, maybe ask for code snippets or even entire functions. They can't be 100% correct because it doesn't have context... you might need to paste in some code to begin with. When there's errors, paste them in, maybe you'll get advice. If you're comfy? Switch seats, start using claude code. Now you're telling claude what to do. And you can still ask the same questions you were asking before. But now you don't need to paste into the web interface anymore, and the AI sure as heck can type faster than you can. Aren't you getting tired of every iteration where you're telling the AI \"this went wrong\", \" that went wrong\"? Maybe make sure there's a way for the AI to test stuff itself, so it can iterate a few cycles automatically.  Your LLM can iterate through troubleshooting steps faster than you can type the first one. Still... keep an eye on it. And, really that's about where I am now. reply",

Sometimes I’ll even do this in a separate Claude (not Claude Code) conversation, which I feel works a bit faster. Once we have an approach, I will ask it to create an implementation plan in a markdown file, I clear context and then tell it to implement the plan.

I had the newest Claude Code (4.6?) look over the tests on the day it was released and the issues it found were really, really bad. Now, the newest plan is to produce a tool which generates the tests from a DSL so they can't be made to pass and/or match buggy code instead of the clearly defined specification.

I don’t blame people for being upset when it can’t do what all the hype says it will do. The way people talk about the latest Claude Code is the same way people were talking 2-3 years ago about whatever the latest model was then. Every release gets marketed as if it’s a new level of magic, yet we’re still here having the same debates about merit, because reality doesn’t match the marketing and hype. It has gotten better, I tried something with early ChatGPT that failed horribly (a basic snake game written in C), and just tried the exact same thing again last week and it worked—it wasn’t good, but it technically worked. But if it took 3 years to get good enough to pass my basic test, why was I being fed those lies 3 years ago? The AI companies are like the boy who cried wolf. At this point, it’s on them to prove they can do what they say, not up to me to put in extraordinary efforts to try and get value out of their product. Last week I sat through a talk from one of our SVPs who said development is cheap and easy now, then he went on about the buy vs build debate for 20 minutes. It’s like he read a couple articles and drank the kool-aid. I also saw someone talking about ephemeral programs… seeing a future where if you want to listen to some MP3s, you’ll just type in a prompt to generate a bespoke music player. This would require AI to reliably one-shot apps like Winamp or iTunes in a few words from a layperson with no programming background. These are the ideas the hype machine is putting in people’s minds that seem detached from reality. I don’t think the, “you’re holding it wrong”, type responses are a good defense. It’s more that it’s being marketed wrong, because all these companies need to maintain the hype to keep raising money. When people use the AI the way the hype tells them it should work… it doesn’t work. reply",

One might say it is ok because it is fast to generate, but the bigger the application, every change gets more expensive and it always forget to do something.\n4. Tests it generates is mostly useless. 9/10 times it always passes on all tests it creates for itself but the code does not even start. No matter what type of test.\n5. Frequently lied about the current state of the code and only when pushed it will admit it was wrong. As others said, it is a mix of the (misnomer) Danny Kruger effect and some hype. I tried possibly every single trick to get it working better but I feel most are just tricks. They are not necessarily making it work better. It is not completely useless, my work involves doing prototypes now and then and usually they need to be quite extensive. For that it has been a help. But I don't feel it is close to what they sell reply",

I didn’t realize this until transferring to an office that had very few IT workers. Everyone in IT seemed miserable, while everyone outside of IT seemed extremely happy. I once made a rather sarcastic and cynical joke in the elevator to someone in a customer support role and it went over like a led ballon… but that was the language of everyone I worked with in IT. It was wild to me how two departments sitting 50 feet from each other could have such drastically different cultures. On town halls, everyone in the chat is brimming with company pride, meanwhile the side chats from people in the IT org are full of cynicism and sarcasm, with everyone trying to understand if these people are real or just bots… but I think they’re real. reply",

The most anyone could realistically ask you to do was please fill out the survey positively to try and support the company if you believe it's a best place to work and remind more people to complete the surveys. I don't think companies are really out here trying to game the more reputable surveys, and it would be pretty easily for single employees to defect/report if they were.

Last month wrote a whole coding principles AGENTS/CLAUDE MD file but not clear if the produced code has changed _because of_ that or other reasons. Couple of things give me confidence that the models actually do read them and follow them. 1) I have a sentence that says: \"I am your pairing buddy Bob. Occasionally address me by my name.\" And you will see them address you by the name, occasionally.\n2) I do have per project \"Project Tenets.\" Each tenets is a catchy couple of words, like Design for Agent First, Tolerant Interfaces over Robust Interfaces. If you notice the coding assistant referring to this you know they are aware, and they do sometimes refer to it. I also have a common list of principles but I think they are less useful because those are generic for software engineering.\n3) Occasionally, I will do the following prompt:\ni) Who am I?\nii) What is our design philosophy and tenets?\niii) Go through the repo and ensure the architecture and codebase adheres to our design philosophy and tenets.

The assumption was that using common 3D printer measurement tools (like for bed-leveling) would provide a way to read back whatever data was encoded onto the surface.<p>Since that seems like a pretty well-known concept, crudely applied to a domain I haven't seen it in before - but is already large and growing fast - I'm assuming that others have thought of this? I was hoping maybe someone had implemented something like it?\nAnd then, obviously, if that proof of concept exists, I'd wonder about some kind of advanced version that used specialized equipment for the reading (and possibly the writing/printing).<p>In any case, I'm just curious. I was thinking about long term (century +) archival storage, or encryption keys only stored as the print with no digital copies. Stuff that wouldn't need tons of storage, but would be crucial to maintain statically. It probably wouldn't be useful for that, which is why I assume I'm not finding much in my searches for it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew about it, in case there is stuff it's good for.</p></p></div>",

It is also pretty much guaranteed that whatever happens we will have the technology to read it again. Exotics like laser engraved metal plates or ceramics might be better if you have a lot of data and can’t guarantee your storage will be fire and flood free. If you don’t have a lot of data you can also think of engraving it into stone or press it into a clay tablet and fire it.

But... is anyone doing that with a 3D printer? Or a CNC machine, for that matter? I think some of the other answered showed that people are, it's just pretty niche.

I've been spending a lot of time lately looking at security issues in AI-generated code specifically and the patterns are wild. the agents don't just make random mistakes, they have consistent blind spots - auth flows, input validation, race conditions in async stuff. and these aren't the kind of bugs that show up in a demo or even in basic tests. at my work we tried letting two agents work on different parts of the same service for about a week. the code each produced was fine individually but the integration points were a mess - inconsistent error handling, one agent assumed the other's API would validate inputs. classic stuff that a human writing both sides would catch instinctively. honestly I think the people pushing level 8 orchestration are optimizing for lines of code produced per hour which is maybe the least useful metric in software engineering reply",

This is him trying to FOMO listeners into using his project. From what I've observed, the people trying to use herds of agents to work on different things at the same time are just using tokens as fast as possible because they think more tokens means more progress. As you scale up the sub-agents you spend so much time managing the herd and trying to backtrack when things go wrong that you would have been better off handling it serially with yourself in the loop. If you don't have someone else paying the bill for unlimited token usage it's going to be a very expensive experiment. reply",

Modern agentic coding spins up its own sub-agents when it makes sense to parallelize. It's just not as sexy as typing a sentence and letting your AI bill go BRR (and then talking about it). I'd like to see some actual results with a meaningful benchmark of software output that shows that agent orchestrators accomplish any meaningful improvement in the state of the art of software engineering, other than spending more tokens.

I ended up building a \"traffic light\" protocol (essentially a semaphore for swarms) just to force serialization on critical tasks. It kills the speed slightly but stops the \"death spiral\" where one agent's error cascades through the herd.

A lot of the safety guardrails we need don't even exist yet. I'm working on all that currently. Trying to set up local systems to do practical and secure orchestrated AI work, without over-reliance on proprietary systems and platforms. Turns out it's a buttload of work. Yegge's own project (Gas Town) is a real world attempt to build just the agent part, and still many more parts are needed. It's so complicated, I don't think any open source solution is going to become dominant, because there's  too much to integrate. The company that perfects this is going to be the next GitHub and Heroku rolled into one. I get why people question all this. It's a completely different way of working that flies in the face of every best practice and common-sense lesson you learn as a software developer. But once you wrap your head around it, it makes total sense. You don't need to read code to know a system works and is reliable. You don't need to manually inspect the quality of things if there's other ways to establish trust. Work gets done a lot faster with automation, ironically with fewer errors. You can use cutting-edge technology to improve safety and performance, and ship faster. These aren't crazy hypothetical ideals - what I just described is  modern auto manufacturing. If it's safe enough for a car, it's safe enough for a web app. reply",

The best pattern I've seen: give each agent clear module boundaries (not file-level, but architectural). Think micro-services even in a monolith. Then each agent owns its domain end-to-end. Also: dry-run everything. Let agents propose changes, then review before applying. It's like having a senior dev who says 'wait, let me think about this' before every commit.

          "text": "I stopped manually writing code 6-9mo ago, and am generating high-quality code on the dimensions we care about like GPU perf benchmarks, internal & industry conformance standards test suites, evals benchmarks, lint/type checkers, etc. It's not perfect code - there are clear AI slop tell tales that review cycles still let linger - but it's doing more ambitious things than we'd do on most dimensions like capability, quality, and volume. We're solving years-old GPU bugs that we had given up on as mere mortals. And yes, we build our own orchestrator tech, both as our product (not vibes coding but vibes investigating), and more relevant here, our internal tooling. For example, otel & evals increasingly drive our AI coding loops rather than people. Codex and claude code are great agentic coding harnesses, so our 'custom orchestration' work is more about more intelligently using them in richer pipelines, like the above eval-driven loop. They've been pretty steadily adding features like parallel subagents that work in teams, and hookable enough to do most tricks, that I don't feel the need to use others. We're busy enough adapting on our own! reply",

I think some of the sliders were for \"popularity\", \"recency\" and perhaps \"author's score\". I also think, but I'm not sure, that the blog featured general ML topics.<p>I played with the sliders for sometime and had a great time exploring the blog, but I have since failed to find it again. I should've bookmark it then.<p>Does anyone have some clue about it? Much appreciated</p></p></p></div>",

If the subsidized cheap access vanishes because these companies can't eat the losses anymore, do the tools just disappear? Because if a tool like Claude Code (or any other LLM) suddenly cost $1,000 a month to reflect what it actually costs to run, would people keep paying for it out of pocket? Would their companies?<p>I’m especially curious to hear from anyone who lived through 2000 or 2008. Does a postbubble world mean we just abandon the tech entirely or is it a move toward expensive solutions?</p></p></p></div>",

Initially there will be no \"flat rate\" subscriptions like currently (similar to early Internet), those will come once the prices are low enough further out.\nRunning the LLMs is a low-margin business not justifying high multiples. reply",

          "text": "I think the tech would continue to exist since there is already a market for it and I do believe it will increase productivity. I just get concerned about the concentration of value (for example, 30ish percent of the S&P 500s value is tied to 7 companies) and the shear size of the capex going on (conservatively, hundreds of billions). This increases the risk significantly. Even a normal correction (20% decline) of the stock prices of those 7, will wipe out trillions of dollars in market value and hit everyone, because everyone is essentially invested in it already and the repercussions of that could be brutal (deep recession). Additionally, new tech could make all the CAPEX in data centers or businesses useless in the fairly near future, but this can be hard to predict (black swan). I think of quantum computers or advancements like DeepSeek's LLM reinforcement learning style, but it will likely be something that isn't in anyone's mind yet. There is also a vast opportunity cost to all this investment. Those with wealth will be fine (why do you think they're building bunkers), everyone else will pay the price. reply",

A hard question to answer then is, what is the ROI if an organization is spending $10k/month on AI tools but project deliveries are mostly the same as before? If the AI tool companies increase their rates 2x, 5x, 10x, is it worth it? They aren't going to lower prices. Consumer AI tool usage isn't going to get a lot of adopters that will pay, people outside of a work environment will see it as a fun toy, much like social media and will be fine with being served ads and letting their loss of privacy be the cost. reply",

It will allow the \"real\" users to continue having access to it and sieve out the ones who are just playing around. Prices for RAM, GPUs, SSDs will normalize a lot and more people will move towards local models. Similarly to what happened with the dot-com bubble (I saw it happening), it doesn't mean that everything will disappear, but that it will change/adapt.

          "text": "I think the “AI bubble burst” framing is too simplistic. Bubbles don’t erase technology. They erase mispriced capital. In 2000, internet stocks collapsed. The internet didn’t. What disappeared were business models built on fantasy unit economics. The same distinction matters here. If AI funding compresses, here’s what likely happens: • Speculative AI wrappers die fast\n• Subsidized API pricing rises toward real compute cost\n• Consolidation around a few model and infrastructure providers\n• Enterprises shift from experimentation to strict ROI enforcement Right now a lot of AI usage is artificially cheap. Growth is being prioritized over margin. If that flips, casual usage drops. That doesn’t mean the tools disappear. It means only usage that creates measurable value survives. If a tool suddenly costs $1,000 per month, most hobbyists won’t pay. But that’s irrelevant. The real question is whether it replaces or amplifies enough labor to justify the price. If it saves a team $8,000 to $20,000 in monthly productivity or headcount cost, it survives. If it’s just a nice-to-have, it dies. The bigger risk isn’t foundation models disappearing. It’s the application layer collapsing. A lot of AI startups exist purely because inference is subsidized. If API pricing normalizes, many evaporate overnight. A post-bubble AI world probably looks less magical and less overfunded, but more disciplined. Fewer demos. More boring enterprise contracts. More focus on margins. The internet after 2000 didn’t disappear. It matured and consolidated into utilities. AI likely follows the same path. The real question isn’t whether AI vanishes.\nIt’s who was relying on subsidies instead of economics. reply",

          "text": "Well, in 2000, I lived in Atlanta with 4 years of experience.  2000 wasn’t bad outside of Silicon Valley.  If you were an enterprise developer targeting banks, insurance companies in a 2nd tier city, there was no affect.  I had no problem finding a job. I also was looking for a job in 2008 - again in Atlanta, I was 34 and again had no trouble finding your regular old dev job. The AI bubble busting means absolutely nothing to me as far as career prospects. While every project I do now is related to AI working in cloud consulting + app dev, AI is just another tool in my tool belt. “All of the spending” means nothing to Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. They all are spending out of free cash flow and the hardware they are buying have a high failure rate and will be worthless in 3 years anyway.  That just means they won’t replenish the hardware. For the most part, I don’t deal with VC funded unprofitable companies - see how the bubble busting didn’t affect me. If Claude Code becomes more expensive - which I doubt, compute gets cheaper over time and if the bubble does burst, that means compute gets cheaper because of excessive capacity. On the other hand, I don’t pay for Claude Code myself, if the company thinks it does add value, the company I work for will up my monthly allowance from $1000 a month.  If I were paying myself, I would just buy a computer that could run a local model. reply",

Or like the first printing press. Or even cells going multi-cellular, emergence of nerve cells, ganglions, brains. It is a step change in the life of information. Non-substrate locked information, approaching an ability to improve itself isn’t a phase. it isn’t an adoption S-curve. It is too fundamental, and has too many paths leading forward, by organizations and individuals, to ever be as simple as a bubble. There may well be turbulence. But any computing power overhang created by over investment in one segment will get quickly absorbed by another segment. So there may be train wrecks, but the industry as a whole is going to thrive. The problems I see are the unlimited downstream disruption of AI on everything else. Everything else. But for AI itself, the future is bright. reply",

          "text": "I think, the cost of running and training models is going to fall due to Moore's law and friends. That also meas that the worth of today's computers declines rapidly and all the money invested in compute power with it. Compute is basically what the AI VC money is spend on. That money will be gone in a few years due to the hardware being worthless. On the other side running a model (locally) will become cheaper and cheaper to the point that Ai stuff becomes a everyday commodity running on cheapo devices everywhere. Then there are optimizations too. Which lowers the cost. So it's not going away and it's not going to be expensive for the consumer in the long run. My 5 year old rtx 2027 runs models those output would have been state of the art a couple of years ago.\nIn a few years something running on the level of today's top models might run under your desk if that progress goes on at this pace. reply",

I got more improvement because storing and reading from the first page of memory took two clock cycles instead of 3. But this isn’t 1986, this is 2026. I “vibe coded” my first project this year.  I designed the AWS architecture from the an empty account using IAC, I chose every service to use, I verified every permission,  I chose and designed the orchestration, the concurrency model, I gathered requirements.  What I didn’t do is look at a line of Python code or infrastructure code aside from the permissions that Codex generated. Now to answer your questions : How did I validate the correctness? Just like if I had written it myself.  I had Codex to create a shell script to do end to end tests of all of the scenarios I cared about and when one broke, I went back to Codex to fix it. I was very detailed about the scenarios. The web front end that I used was built by another developer.  I haven’t touched web dev in a decade. I told Codex what changes I needed and I verified the changes by deploying it and testing it manually. How did I validate the performance? Again just like I would do on something I wrote.  I tested it first with a few hundred  transactions to verify the  functionality and then I stress tested it with a real world amount a transactions.  The first iteration broke horribly.  Not because of Claude code.  It was a bad design. But here’s the beauty.  It took me a day to do the bad implementation that would have taken me three or four days.  I then redesigned it, didn’t use the AWS service and did I designed that was much more scalable and it took a day.  I knew in theory how it worked under the hood.  But not in practice.  Again I tested for scalability by testing the result. The architectural quality? I validated it by synthesizing real world traffic.  ChatGPT in thinking mode did find a subtle concurrency bug.  That was my fault though.  I designed the concurrency implementation, Codex just did what I told it to do. Subtle bugs happen whether people write it or an agent writes it.  You do the best you can with your tests and when they come up you fix it? How do I prevent technical debt? All large implementations have technical debt. Again just like when I lead a team - I componenitize everything with clean interfaces.  It makes it easier for coding agents and people. reply",

It can explain topics in more detail, or it can tell you that the thing you asked will be explained later in the book. And it will allow you to skip material that you are already familiar with. Provide references to other resources, etc.<p>Maybe ingesting an entire book is too much for current LLMs, but I'm sure there are ways around that.<p>Note: I am __not__ trying to build such a tool myself.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "FWIW, I like the following simple prompt to rewrite text the way the author should have written it in the first place (in most cases): > Distill $content by condensing sentences without loss of meaning and then restructuring as a Minto Pyramid. Use point headings, not trite labels; prose, not bullet points; and up to four outline levels, as appropriate. Provide summary umbrella sections to enumerate upcoming sub-points. That usually gets the main points toward the top and logically organizes supporting details. It lets me quickly grok the gist. But it's always lossy and doesn't convey all levels of the text. If the text is worth reading and understanding, then I like to paste the original text into a plain text file or outliner; put each sentence on its own line (you can use an LLM for this but regex is better, faster, and cheaper); and both rewrite and reorganize it myself. (Sublime Text and outliners such as Bike and OmniOutliner make moving and indenting lines easy with keyboard shortcuts.) PS: People need to learn that they should either write better in the first place or else have an LLM properly structure their writing so that it gets done correctly once \"on the server side\" instead of forcing each reader to do it for them many times (inefficiently and more expensively) on the reader / \"client side\". PPS: Kagi's Research and Research (Experimental) models work well with the prompt suggested above. reply",

If too many people are able to compete against you, or just do whatever you're providing themselves, then you have no addressable market. It doesn't matter how productive you are. This is why SASS valuations are crashing right now.

It was done with more care and thought. The idea was cheap, 1,000 songs in your pocket. An implementation that connected with people and brought it to the mainstream was hard. Someone quickly vibe coding something might fulfill the requirements of an idea. However, their implementation will likely be poor and lack the care needed to connect with people on a way that makes them want to use it. I think understanding this has always been the key to standing out. That doesn’t change in the world of LLM, it becomes more important than ever. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been building multi-step AI workflows with multiple agents (planning, reasoning, tool use, etc.), and I sometimes run into cases where the final output is incorrect even though nothing technically fails. There are no runtime errors - just wrong results.<p>The main challenge is figuring out where things went wrong. The issue could be in an early reasoning step, how context is passed between steps, or a subtle mistake that propagates through the system. By the time I see the final output, it’s not obvious which step caused the problem.<p>I’ve been using Langfuse for tracing, which helps capture inputs and outputs, but in practice I still end up manually inspecting each step one by one to diagnose issues, which gets tiring quickly.<p>I’m curious how others are approaching this. Are there better ways to structure or instrument these workflows to make failures easier to localize? Any patterns, tools, or techniques that have worked well for you?</p></p></p></div>",

Guys are automating everything in their jobs, spinning up 10 specialized agents at a time and running multi-agent pipelines, just doing all sorts of crazy things with this tech that I just can't even fathom. It seems like it's making them way more productive.<p>I have found a way to fit code-writing and question-answering chatbots into my workflow. I have NOT done the same in terms of these crazy Agent setups. There's clearly a way to leverage these tools to turbocharge your productivity, like at least 2x or maybe even 10x. But what is it?<p>Are there any Agentic power users out there who can enlighten me? What are the best ways to take advantage of these new tools?</p></p></p></div>",

If you are automating something that isn't high impact or important, sure just let it write the code and don't even verify it. But in a big org, you'll need to validate it on every step, every generated line of code can have bugs, injections and negative side-effects. I believe you'll be more productive by using it, and prompting well, but you'll need to invest much more time on double-checking if everything is working accordingly to what you initially planned, or you might ship very broken code in production that can be difficult to revert, at a times. 2x productivity is possible, but it really depends on the kind of tasks you get. If your entire job is prototyping stuff, sure you are now 100x+. But if you need to write very complex business logic that will last for years, with lots of back and forth and discussions with PMs and whatnot, which is the majority of SWE corporate jobs... my bet you'd be at maximum 1.5x! reply",

          "text": "I tried to write my first blog posts using AI. I created dozens of restrictions and rules so that it would produce human-like text, which I then edited. The text contained only my thoughts, but the AI formatted them. However, no matter how much I tried to prohibit constructions such as \"It's not X, it's Y!\", it still added them. I had to revise 10 drafts before I had the final version. When I stopped using AI for my texts, my productivity increased, and I can now complete an essay in 1-2 drafts, which is 5 times faster than when using AI. This is strikingly different from development. In development, AI increases my productivity fivefold, but in texts, it slows me down. I thought, maybe the problem is simply that I don't know how to write texts, but I do know how to develop?\nBut the thing is, AI development uses standard code, with recognized patterns, techniques, and architecture. It does what (almost) the best programmer in their field would do. And its code can be checked with linters and tests. It's verifiable work. But AI is not yet capable of writing text the way a living person does. Because text cannot be verified. reply",

          "text": "You’re describing a real coordination problem: over-polished, abstraction-heavy “AI voice” increases cognitive load and reduces signal. Since you don’t have positional authority—and leadership models the behavior—you need norm-shaping, not enforcement.\nHere are practical levers that work without calling anyone out: 1. Introduce a “Clarity Standard” (Not an Anti-AI Rule)\nDon’t frame it as anti-AI. Frame it as decision hygiene.\nPropose lightweight norms in a team doc or retro: TL;DR (≤3 lines) required One clear recommendation Max 5 bullets State assumptions explicitly If AI-assisted, edit to your voice This shifts evaluation from how it was written to how usable it is.\nTypical next step:\nDraft a 1-page “Decision Writing Guidelines” and float it as “Can we try this for a sprint?” 2. Seed a Meme That Rewards Brevity\nSocial proof beats argument.\nExamples you can casually share in Slack: “If it can’t fit in a screenshot, it’s not a Slack message.” “Clarity > Fluency.” “Strong opinions, lightly held. Weak opinions, heavily padded.” Side-by-side:\nAI paragraph → Edited human version (cut by 60%) You’re normalizing editing down, not calling out AI.\nTypical next step:\nPost a before/after edit of your own message and say: “Cut this from 300 → 90 words. Feels better.” 3. Cite Credible Writing Culture References\nFrame it as aligning with high-signal orgs: High Output Management – Emphasizes crisp managerial communication. The Pyramid Principle – Lead with the answer. Amazon – Narrative memos, but tightly structured and decision-oriented. Stripe – Known for clear internal writing culture. Shopify – Publicly discussed AI use, but with expectations of accountability and ownership. You’re not arguing against AI; you’re arguing for ownership and clarity.\nTypical next step:\nShare one short excerpt on “lead with the answer” and say: “Can we adopt this?” 4. Shift the Evaluation Criteria in Meetings\nWhen someone posts AI-washed text, respond with: “What’s your recommendation?” “If you had to bet your reputation, which option?” “What decision are we making?” This conditions brevity and personal ownership.\nTypical next step:\nStart consistently asking “What do you recommend?” in threads. 5. Propose an “AI Transparency Norm” (Soft)\nNot mandatory—just a norm: “If you used AI, cool. But please edit for voice and add your take.” This reframes AI as a drafting tool, not an authority.\nTypical next step:\nAdd a line in your team doc: “AI is fine for drafting; final output should reflect your judgment.” 6. Run a Micro-Experiment\nOffer: “For one sprint, can we try 5-bullet max updates?” If productivity improves, the behavior self-reinforces. Strategic Reality\nIf the CEO models AI-washing, direct confrontation won’t work. Culture shifts via: Incentives (brevity rewarded) Norms (recommendations expected) Modeling (you demonstrate signal-dense writing) You don’t fight AI. You make verbosity socially expensive. If helpful, I can draft: A 1-page clarity guideline A Slack post to introduce it A short internal “writing quality” rubric A meme template you can reuse Which lever feels safest in your org right now? reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had a thought about encoding a very small amount of data onto some kind of \"disk\" using 3D printing as the mechanism for filament-based storage. The assumption was that using common 3D printer measurement tools (like for bed-leveling) would provide a way to read back whatever data was encoded onto the surface.<p>Since that seems like a pretty well-known concept, crudely applied to a domain I haven't seen it in before - but is already large and growing fast - I'm assuming that others have thought of this? I was hoping maybe someone had implemented something like it?\nAnd then, obviously, if that proof of concept exists, I'd wonder about some kind of advanced version that used specialized equipment for the reading (and possibly the writing/printing).<p>In any case, I'm just curious. I was thinking about long term (century +) archival storage, or encryption keys only stored as the print with no digital copies. Stuff that wouldn't need tons of storage, but would be crucial to maintain statically. It probably wouldn't be useful for that, which is why I assume I'm not finding much in my searches for it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew about it, in case there is stuff it's good for.</p></p></div>",

Stored in the right circumstances (not too humid, dark place, not on fire) it should last half a millennia easily. It is also pretty much guaranteed that whatever happens we will have the technology to read it again. Exotics like laser engraved metal plates or ceramics might be better if you have a lot of data and can’t guarantee your storage will be fire and flood free. If you don’t have a lot of data you can also think of engraving it into stone or press it into a clay tablet and fire it. These mediums are known to be very stable even in adverse circumstances. reply",

I guess you could consider it an \"offline datastore as a service.\" It would be a pretty good offline storage of keys with a way to request a paper copy. Certainly issues of trust and physical security but wrapping it with encryption would be easy. Also benefit from your government's legal protections for mail. There might actually be a usecase here.

And discolorations can be picked up with optical methods, which are far more accessible, reliable and higher density than 3d scanning. Another variation of this is how we encode information into granite and other stones in Western funeral rites (grave stones): you engrave the information, then fill the groove with pigment. The pigment is susceptible to weathering, but the 3d information is pretty resistant. When the pigment is too worn down you just smear some more on there and wipe the excess away, leaving pigment only in the grooves, making the message clearly visible again reply",

          "text": "The truth is that there is a lot of hype. You need to be reasonably experienced and guide it. First, you need to know that Claude will create nonsensical code. On a macro level it's not exactly smart it just has a lot of contextual static knowledge. Debugging is not it's strongest skill. Most models don't do good at all. Opus is able to one-shot \"troubleshooting\" prompts occasionally, but it's a high probability that it veer of on a tangent if you just tell it to \"fix things\" based on errors or descriptions. You need to have an idea what you want fixed. Another problem is that it can create very convincing looking - but stupid - code. If you can't guide it, that's almost guaranteed. It can create code that's totally backwards and overly complicated. If it IS going on a wrong tangent, it's often hopeless to get it back on track. The conversation and context might be polluted. Restart and reframe the prompt and the problems at hand and try again. I'm not totally sure about the language you are using, but syntax errors typically happens if it \"forgets\" to update some of the code, and very seldom just in a single file or edit. I like to create a design.md and think a bit on my own, or maybe prompt to create it with a high level problem to get going, and make sure it's in the context (and mentioned in the prompts) reply",

While this may be possible, it likely requires a very detailed prompt and/or spec document. --- Here is an example of something I successfully built with Claude: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app Apparently I have had over 150 chat sessions related to the research and development of this tool. - First, we wrote a spec together: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-transcription/blob/main/spec... - The spec broke down development into major phases. I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting. And after implementation, I often had to have Claude fix bugs in the implementation. - I tried to share the chat session where Claude got the first functional MVP working: https://opncd.ai/share/fXsPn1t1 (unfortunately the shared session is truncated) --- \"AI mistakes you're probably making\": https://youtu.be/Jcuig8vhmx4 I think the most relevant point is: AI is best for accelerating development tasks you could do on your own; not new tasks you don't know how to do. --- Finally: Cloudlflare builds OAuth with Claude and publishes all the prompts: https://hw.leftium.com/#/item/44159166 reply",

Would you say that the spec work was significantly faster (pure time) than coding up the project would have been? Or perhaps a less taxing cognitive input? reply",

          "text": "Yes, it's a lot of spec work. But a lot of it is research and exploring alternatives. Sometimes Claude suggests ideas I would have never thought of or attempted on my own. Like a custom python websocket server: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-local (I also implemented the previous version with only a high-level, basic understanding of websockets: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app/sherpa ) I think of Claude like a \"force-multiplier.\" I have been able to implement ideas I previously gave up on. I can test out new ideas much faster. For example, https://github.com/Leftium/gg started out as 100% hand-crafted code. I wanted gg to be able to print out the expression in the code in addition to the value like python icecream. (It's more useful to get both the value and the variable name/expression.) I previously tried, and gave up. Claude helped me add this feature within a few hours. And now gg has its own virtual dev console optimized for interacting with coding agents. A very useful feature that I would probaly not have attempted without Claude. It's taken the \"open in editor\" feture to a completely new level. I have implemented other features that I would have never attempted or even thought about. For example without Claud's assistance https://ws.leftium.com would not have many features like the animated background that resembles the actual sky color. 60 minute forecast was on my TODO list for a long time. Claude helped me add it within an afternoon or so. Note: depending on complexity of the feature I want to add the spec varies in the level of detail. Sometimes there is no spec outside Claude's plans in the chat session. [1]: https://github.com/gruns/icecream reply",

While Claude goes and works on that for 15 minutes - you can go and do other work. Or talk with another Claude in another window to make progress on another project. A good mental model is to imagine you're talking to a remote developer. You need to give them an extremely detailed spec on the first go if you expect them to get it right the first time. Sometimes it's better to explain \"this is my grand vision, but how about we first mockup a prototype to see if that's actually how I want it to work\". Sometimes Claude will suggest you talk about your plan together first to remove the ambiguities from the plan, or you can encourage Claude to do that with you. (Also, the remote developer mindset is useful - treat the remote developer with respect, with humanity, and they're more likely to be helpful towards you and motivated to align with your goals.)

The agentic harness of the software around the model (ie Claude Code) is important. Consider also that some of us have been doing this for a year and have already built our own MCP server tooling to go faster. Giving your AI the same kind of deterministic software tools that you use is important (eg make sure your AI has access to a diff tool, don't make it try and do that \"in its head\", you wouldn't ask that of a human). As for listening to Hacker News... yeah, this is one of the worst places (well, Mastodon is worse) and HN is surprisingly AI-doomerish. I don't check in here very often anymore, and as of this week I just get Claude to summarize HN headlines as a morning podcast for me instead. My own experience: my first few uses of Claude in Dec 2024 seemed rubbish, I didn't get it. Then one day I asked it to make me a search engine. The one shot from that wasn't perfect, but it worked, and I saw it build it in front of my eyes. That was the moment & I kept iterating on it. I haven't used Google or Kagi in almost a year now.

It turns out that a simple SQLite database is a lot more capable and faster than I thought. I index from my laptop, using another tool I built with Claude. I don't crawl or spider, I focus on indexing from sitemap.xml files and RSS feeds. I have about 1.5 Million pages in my local index, and I get search results in 40ms - 70ms, thereabouts. For every search that doesn't find results - and of course that's still the majority - it falls back to a meta-search combining results from Brave, Mojeek & Marginalia. The core of that metasearch is what Claude 3.5v2 generated for me in a one-shot back in Dec 2024. Kagi is just a metasearch with a very small local index as well, and my main purpose in building this was replacing Kagi for my needs. The last 10% of my queries were widget queries like currency conversion, distance & temperature conversion etc that I was using for about 10% of my search queries. reply",

My preferred method of building things, and I've built a lot of things using Claude, is to have a discussion with it in the chatbot. The back and forth of exploring the idea gives you a more solid idea of what you're looking for. Once we've established the idea I get it to write a spec and a plan. I have this as an instruction in my profile. > When we're discussing a coding project, don't produce code unless asked to. We discuss projects here, Claude Code does the actual coding. When we're ready, put all the documents in a zip file for easy transfer (downloading  files one at a time and uploading them is not fun on a phone). Include a CONTENTS.md describing the contents and where to start. So I'll give you this one as an example. It's a Qwen driven System monitor. https://github.com/lawless-m/Marvinous here are the documents generated in chat before trying to build anything https://github.com/lawless-m/Marvinous/tree/master/ai-monito...

That is a very wrong approach, not just with Claude but with everything(you ask a woman for a date and if you do not get laid in five minutes you failed?). When I program something manually and compiles, I expect it to be wrong. You have to iron it and debug it. Instead of that: 1.Divide the work in independent units. I call this \"steps\" 2.Subdivide steps into \"subsets\"\nYou work in an isolated manner on those subsets. 3.Use an inmediate gui interface like dear imgui to prototype your tool. Translating then into using something else once it works is quite easy of LLMs. 4.Visualize everything. You do not need to see the code but you need to visualise every single thing you ask it to do. 5.Tell Claude what you want and why you want it and update the documentation constantly. 6. Use git in order to make rock solid steps that Claude will not touch when it works and you can revert changes or ask the ia to explore a branch, explaining how you did something and want something similar. 7. Do not modify code that already works rock solid. Copy it into another step leaving the step as reference and modify it there. 5.Use logs. Lots of logs. For every step you create text logs and you debug the problems giving Claude the logs to read them. 6.Use screenshots. Claude can read screenshots. If you visualise everything, clause can see the errors too. 7.Use asserts, lots of asserts, just like with manual programming. It is not that different from managing a real team of people... reply",

When doing it yourself, you can make decisions in the moment, try things, pivot… when trying to delegate these things, it becomes a chore to try to clarify things that are inherently unclear, and pivot an idea when the person (or AI) being delegated to doesn’t fully grasp the pivot and keeps bringing in old ideas.

This is what my initial prompt looked like: --- I'd like to add an archives mode to the daily challenge. This will allow players to complete any daily challenges they didn't attempt on the actual day. It will look like a calendar, with the dates in Green if it was played, and in white if not. The archive should only go back to January 30, 2026, the day the project started. Include a to do to change this date prior to release. Rewards for completing daily challenges via the archive should be 25% of the normal value. --- Claude Code then asked me a couple of clarifying questions before it harnessed the superpowers:writing-plans skill and generate a document to plan the work. The document it put together is viewable at https://gist.github.com/Jeremy1026/cee66bf6d4b67d9a527f6e30f... There were a couple of edits that I made to the document before I told it to implement. It then fired off a couple of agents to perform the tasks in parallel where possible. Once it finished I tested and it worked as I had hoped. But there was a couple of follow up things that would make it more intertwined with everything else going on around daily challenges. So I followed up with: --- lets give 1 cell for compelting an archived daily challenge --- And finally: --- Now that we are tracking completions, can we update the notification to complete daily mission to include \"Keep your X day streak\" --- reply",

          "text": "Another example is the tower stat caps. When Claude Code generate the first pass, it make it so that the tower level would control each individual stat's cap. Which was way too high. I didn't know exactly what the limits were, but knew they needed to be pulled back some. So I asked it: -Start Prompt- Currently, a towers level sets the maximum a single stat can be. Can you tell me what those stat caps are? -End Prompt- This primed the context to have information about the stat caps and how they are tied to levels. I followed up after it gave me a chart back with Tower Level and Max Stat Rank with some real stats from play -Start Prompt- Lets change the stat cap, the caps are currently far too high. All towers start at 1 for each IMPACT stat, my oldest tower is Level 5, and its stats are I-3, M-4, P-6, A-3, C-1, T-1. How do you think I could go about reducing the cap in a meaningful way. -End Prompt- It came back with a solution to reduce the individual stat cap for individual stats to be tower level + 1. But I felt that was too limiting. I want players to be able to specialize a tower so I told it have the stat cap be total, not per stat. -Start Prompt- I'm thinking about having a total stat cap, so in this towers case, the total stats are 18. -End Prompt- It generated a couple of structures of how the cap could increase and presented them to me. -Start Prompt- Yes, it would replace the per-stat cap entirely. If a player wants to specialize a tower in one stat using the entire cap that is fine. Lets do 10 + (rank * 3), that will give the user a little bit of room to train a new tower. Since it's a total stat cap, if a user is training and the tower earns enough stat xp to level beyond the cap, lock the tower at max XP for that stat, and autoamtically level the stat when the user levels up the tower. -End Prompt- It added the cap, but introduced a couple of build errors, so I sent it just the build errors. -Start Prompt- /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerDetailView.swift:231:39 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'tower' is a 'let' constant /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerEditorView.swift:181:47 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'towerInstance' is a 'let' constant -End Prompt- And thus, a new stat cap system was implemented. reply",

It doesn’t work that way (not well, at least) The LLM under the hood is essentially a very fancy autocomplete. This always needs to be kept in mind when working with these tools. So you have to focus a lot on what the source text is that’s going to be used to produce the completion. The better the source text, the better the completion. In other words, you need to make sure you progressively fill the context window with stuff that matters for the task that you’re doing. In particular, first explore the problem space with the tool (iterate), then use the exploration results to plan what needs doing (iterate), when the plan looks good and makes sense, only then you ask to actually implement. Claude’s built in planning mode kind of does this, but in my opinion it sucks. It doesn’t make iterating on the exploration and the plan easy or natural. So I suggest just setting up some custom prompts (skills) for this with instructions that make sense for the particular domain/use case, and use those in the normal mode. reply",

          "text": "1. Make sure you are using Opus model. Type /model and make sure Opus is selected. While many say sonnet is good, too, I’m not too convinced. Opus is the first model that actually convinced me to use AI as my daily driver - and I’m a developer for about 20 years.\n2. Make the tasks as small and specific as possible. Don’t prompt „create a todo app with user login“ but „create a vue app where users can register, don’t do more than that“, then „build a user  login“ then, „create a page to create todo items“, then „create a page to list todo items“, then „on list page, add delete functionality“ - and so on, you get the idea.\n3. beware the context size. Claude code will warn you if you exceed it, but even before: the higher the context window, the higher AI will miss things. If you start a new prompt that doesn’t require the whole context of the previous one, type /clear. \n4. build an agents.md or Claude.md. /init will do that for you, but it will just create a Claude.md with information that it might think are important - but easily miss things. You know best. It often also includes file and directory structure, while it could easily find out again (tree command) without that info in agents/claude file. Still I recommend: let Claude create that file, then adjust it to your needs. Only add important stuff here. The more you add, the more you spam the context. Again, try to keep context small. \n5. if Claude needs a long time for finishing a task or did it wrong at first attempt, tell it to update the Claude.md with information to not do the same mistakes the next time again.\n6. make sure you understand the code it created. Add conventions to agents.md that will make the code more readable (use early returns, don‘t exceed nesting level of 3, create new methods with meaningful names instead of inline comments etc.) Good luck! reply",

In my little experience, what I've seen work is that you need to provide a lot of constraints in the form of: - Scope: Don't build a website, but build a feature (either user facing or infra, it doesn't matter). I've found that chunking my prompts in human-manageable tasks that would take 0.5-1 day, is enough of a scale down. - Docs .md files that describe how the main parts of the application work, what a component/module/unit of code looks like, what tools&technologies to use (and links to the latest documentation and quickstart pages). You should commit these to code and update them with every code change (which with Claude is just a reminder in each prompt). - Existing code, if it's not a greenfield project. It really moves away from the advertised paradigm of one-shot vibe-coding but since the quality of the output is really good these days, this long preparation will give you a production ready output much sooner than with traditional methods. reply",

This reminds me of someone who dropped into  #java on undernet once upon a time in the 90s. \"I can't get it to work\" , and we kept trying to debug, and for some reason we kept hitting random new walls. It just never would work!    Turns out that they were deleting their .java file and starting over each time.  Don't do that. --- Take it as a sequence of exercises. Maybe start like this: Don't use claude code at all to begin with. It's a pair programming exercise, and you start at the keyboard, where you're confident and in control. Have claude open in the web interface alongside, talk through the design with it while working; and ask to google stuff for you, look up the api, maybe ask if it remembers the best way(s) to approach the problem. Once you trust it a bit, maybe ask for code snippets or even entire functions. They can't be 100% correct because it doesn't have context... you might need to paste in some code to begin with. When there's errors, paste them in, maybe you'll get advice. If you're comfy? Switch seats, start using claude code. Now you're telling claude what to do. And you can still ask the same questions you were asking before. But now you don't need to paste into the web interface anymore, and the AI sure as heck can type faster than you can. Aren't you getting tired of every iteration where you're telling the AI \"this went wrong\", \" that went wrong\"? Maybe make sure there's a way for the AI to test stuff itself, so it can iterate a few cycles automatically.  Your LLM can iterate through troubleshooting steps faster than you can type the first one. Still... keep an eye on it. And, really that's about where I am now. reply",

Sometimes I’ll even do this in a separate Claude (not Claude Code) conversation, which I feel works a bit faster. Once we have an approach, I will ask it to create an implementation plan in a markdown file, I clear context and then tell it to implement the plan.

I had the newest Claude Code (4.6?) look over the tests on the day it was released and the issues it found were really, really bad. Now, the newest plan is to produce a tool which generates the tests from a DSL so they can't be made to pass and/or match buggy code instead of the clearly defined specification.

I don’t blame people for being upset when it can’t do what all the hype says it will do. The way people talk about the latest Claude Code is the same way people were talking 2-3 years ago about whatever the latest model was then. Every release gets marketed as if it’s a new level of magic, yet we’re still here having the same debates about merit, because reality doesn’t match the marketing and hype. It has gotten better, I tried something with early ChatGPT that failed horribly (a basic snake game written in C), and just tried the exact same thing again last week and it worked—it wasn’t good, but it technically worked. But if it took 3 years to get good enough to pass my basic test, why was I being fed those lies 3 years ago? The AI companies are like the boy who cried wolf. At this point, it’s on them to prove they can do what they say, not up to me to put in extraordinary efforts to try and get value out of their product. Last week I sat through a talk from one of our SVPs who said development is cheap and easy now, then he went on about the buy vs build debate for 20 minutes. It’s like he read a couple articles and drank the kool-aid. I also saw someone talking about ephemeral programs… seeing a future where if you want to listen to some MP3s, you’ll just type in a prompt to generate a bespoke music player. This would require AI to reliably one-shot apps like Winamp or iTunes in a few words from a layperson with no programming background. These are the ideas the hype machine is putting in people’s minds that seem detached from reality. I don’t think the, “you’re holding it wrong”, type responses are a good defense. It’s more that it’s being marketed wrong, because all these companies need to maintain the hype to keep raising money. When people use the AI the way the hype tells them it should work… it doesn’t work. reply",

          "text": "I don't think that's true, I've seen examples to the contrary. Here for example a recent article [1] from a non programmer building a tool. The article is long so I pasted the relevant part below. My thoughts go more in the direction, the article author built something that is complicated for non technical people, but in essence simple -- he says it so himself \"copy paste\". What if what the OP here is building is something novel and Claude doesn't know how to build it? Relevant excerpt: I spent a bit of time last month building a site to solve a problem I’ve always found super-annoying about the legislative process. It’s hard to read Federal bills because they don’t map to the underlying code. Anyone who has worked in Congress knows what I mean, you get a bill that says “change this word from ‘may’ to ‘shall’ in section XYZ of Federal law.” To understand what it does, and find possible loopholes they are trying to sneak in, you have to go to that underlying Federal law and look at where it says “may” and then put “shall” in there and read it. It’s basically like a manual version of copy and pasting, except much more complicated and with lawyers trying to trick you. So I wrote an app that lets you upload legislation, and it automatically shows you how it changes Federal law. There are commercial versions of this software, and some states do it for their proposed legislation. But I haven’t seen anything on the Federal level that is free, so I built it. (The code is here.) It’s not very good. It’ll probably break a lot. There’s no “throat to choke” if you use it and it’s wrong. And my guess is that Anthropic or Gemini ultimately will be able to do this function itself eventually. But the point is that if I can build something like this in my spare time and deploy it without any training at all, then it’s just not that hard for an organization with some capital to get rid of some of its business software tools.

Can make some debugging and fixing that usually requires looking the stack, look the docs and check the tree \n3. Code is spaghetti all way down. One might say it is ok because it is fast to generate, but the bigger the application, every change gets more expensive and it always forget to do something.\n4. Tests it generates is mostly useless. 9/10 times it always passes on all tests it creates for itself but the code does not even start. No matter what type of test.\n5. Frequently lied about the current state of the code and only when pushed it will admit it was wrong. As others said, it is a mix of the (misnomer) Danny Kruger effect and some hype. I tried possibly every single trick to get it working better but I feel most are just tricks. They are not necessarily making it work better. It is not completely useless, my work involves doing prototypes now and then and usually they need to be quite extensive. For that it has been a help.

I’m now at a company building a deeply distributed systems product, and I’m surrounded by incredibly talented engineers who seem exceptionally strong at what they do. They often have knowledge and intuition about things I barely understand.<p>Lately, I’ve been feeling inadequate — like I’m contributing more to the less exciting parts of the product rather than the “cool” or core engineering challenges.<p>On top of that, I’m an immigrant and my wife and I are expecting. Balancing that with a fully remote job has been difficult, and at times I feel like I’ve lost some of my competence or sharpness. I’m taking steps to address this — I’ll be speaking with a psychologist soon — but I genuinely wonder: how does someone overcome these feelings while working within a high-functioning engineering team?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "Imposter syndrome is a thinking trap.  A couple of things you can do to help: Try to separate out 'ruminating' from 'thinking'.  What's the difference? For our purposes 'thinking' has a fixed outcome and an end point.  Trying to solve a coding problem. Working out how to make dinner. Calculating your taxes. When you reach your goal, you're done and you stop.  'Ruminating' has no end point. There is not end or action associated with it.  The tricky part is that it often masquerades as thinking, so you feel like you're solving a problem. For example, you do a job interview and you go over and over what happened in your mind. \"Maybe I should have answered this differently\". \"Maybe I should've prepared some more of these questions\".  Of course, you can't change what happened in the past. You're just rolling the ideas around in your head and probably making yourself feel worse and worse.  Rumination can be focused on the past, the future or even some hypothetical, imaginary situation (\"What if I lost my job\", \"What if my house burnt down\"). Again, actual preparation (Saving an emergency fund. Getting insurance) has an action associated, but rumination never ends, it just keeps going around in your head. The other thing is to keep an accurate record of your performance. This will be different for everyone, and varies a lot depending on the job.  The key thing is to make the record as close in time to the action as possible.  For example, you feel like your pull requests aren't as good as other people's. Don't wait until the end of the week and then reflect on the quality of your work. Instead, every time your make a pull request, write down an accurate, objective assessment of the quality. People who suffer from imposter syndrome tend to forget their wins and remember their losses again and again (there's that rumination!). By having an accurate record that you made yourself you can cut through this and show to yourself your true performance. reply",

That might come from getting in over your head by dishonesty during a job interview or it could come from an employer setting unrealistic expectations and you lying about compatibility to retain employment. To solve for imposter syndrome the following steps must occur: 1. Apply introspection. Know exactly why you are not qualified and try to figure out how you got there. 2. Talk to your supervisor about this. See if they can work with you or help you with training options. 3. Stop being afraid, because it’s time to man up. Realize you have some work to do to catch up outside the office. If you are so unqualified that you can never catch up then it’s time to start exploring other options much sooner than later. Don’t put this off hoping it will fix itself, like a coward. I spent 15 years as a JavaScript developer. That is the land of perpetual imposters. Nobody knows what they doing in JavaScript as your regular corporate employee and will lie through their teeth about it while putting on a face saving show and simultaneously crying on the inside.

Their benefits were great, they were super inclusive, and management really focused on taking care of people. I left the bank for a small company that also claimed to be a best place to work. I didnt like the project I was on and they were quick to fire people to keep metrics like this up. I currently work for a small company that does not advertise about this and just might be the best employer I have ever had. It’s all about the people you work with and the quality of your leaders. reply",

          "text": "You should look at the organization / methodology of the survey, but generally it's a positive to get ranked IMO. I used to get surveys these yearly at a past job from the Boston Globe / Best Places to Work and it was basically a third-party email to all employees with a survey you'd fill out. The most anyone could realistically ask you to do was please fill out the survey positively to try and support the company if you believe it's a best place to work and remind more people to complete the surveys. I don't think companies are really out here trying to game the more reputable surveys, and it would be pretty easily for single employees to defect/report if they were. They also required some level of basic written comments from employees. Probably a mild green flag for quality of life / general happiness from current employees for the past year. reply",

Current employees shouldn’t need an external poll to tell them if people are happy or not. Where I work is almost always on these lists. In my experience it is highly dependent on department. I didn’t realize this until transferring to an office that had very few IT workers. Everyone in IT seemed miserable, while everyone outside of IT seemed extremely happy. I once made a rather sarcastic and cynical joke in the elevator to someone in a customer support role and it went over like a led ballon… but that was the language of everyone I worked with in IT. It was wild to me how two departments sitting 50 feet from each other could have such drastically different cultures. On town halls, everyone in the chat is brimming with company pride, meanwhile the side chats from people in the IT org are full of cynicism and sarcasm, with everyone trying to understand if these people are real or just bots… but I think they’re real. reply",

If I wanted real answers I would find out who works in the group(s) I might end up in and reach out to them via email if I can and then set up a call.  I would be honest and say I do not trust surveys of \"best places to work\" and would happily sign an NDA to not share their brutally honest answers.  Even that I would take with a grain of salt as they may think it is a test or trap. Convincing current employees may work on those that are isolated but if one works in a toxic environment they will likely know it.  There was a time I would have semi-trusted sites like f'd company of long ago but those get infiltrated, sued and ultimately compromised by corporations that do not like people airing their dirty laundry and also gamified by their competitors. If a new position turns out to be a crap-show I would just leave and not add it to my CV.  If an individual manager is the issue, those come and go.  I have found it very easy to make them explore new opportunities. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm trying to decide whether to adopt Cursor for our company, but we're in a heavily regulated industry and our compliance team is flagging concerns about HIPAA/SOC2/audit trails.<p>The thing is, there are companies in regulated industries using it [1][2]. But Cursor has no HIPAA BAA, no FedRAMP certification, and is cloud-only with all requests routing through their AWS infrastructure. (This is probably true for Claude and other coding assistants, though I've only looked seriously at Cursor.)<p>So how are regulated companies actually making this work? Or do most just avoid Cursor and other AI coding tools altogether?<p>[1] 165 healthcare companies use Cursor according to Bloomberry: https://bloomberry.com/data/cursor/<p>[2] Cursor's customers include Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Neuralink: https://cursor.com/customers</p></p></p></p></div>",

Day to day use,  your developers development environment should not have access to any data that comes under HIPAA (the one compliance framework I’m familiar with) If your developer machines don’t have access to regulated data, neither will Cursor.  As far as I know none of those compliance frameworks have anything to do with your code, it’s about accessing data and how you promote your code to production I’ve never used cursor.

Occasionally address me by my name.\" And you will see them address you by the name, occasionally.\n2) I do have per project \"Project Tenets.\" Each tenets is a catchy couple of words, like Design for Agent First, Tolerant Interfaces over Robust Interfaces. If you notice the coding assistant referring to this you know they are aware, and they do sometimes refer to it. I also have a common list of principles but I think they are less useful because those are generic for software engineering.\n3) Occasionally, I will do the following prompt:\ni) Who am I?\nii) What is our design philosophy and tenets?\niii) Go through the repo and ensure the architecture and codebase adheres to our design philosophy and tenets.

I also think, but I'm not sure, that the blog featured general ML topics.<p>I played with the sliders for sometime and had a great time exploring the blog, but I have since failed to find it again.

Honestly I know people who were 'crypto developers' 3 years ago who are now 'senior AI implementation architects' and similar..and they have a 'bootcamp' etc....I am a software engineer who qualified in cs but after working around engineering and manufacturing a lot I'm also qualified in CAD...thinking to get into more physical engineering and become a chartered engineer finally and just get away from the bandwagon boosterism. Or become a nurse or teacher. i'm enjoying making games on the side and I'd like to monetize one soon, but I look at 'tech' careers and I just rapidly lose the will to live now. 30 minutes on linkedin is enough to make most people feel nauseous and need to lie down. reply",

If not, bootstrap some code from screenshots or iteration. Once you have something that works, your agent will be pretty good at being consistent with whatever you're going for and UI will be a \"solved problem\" from then on. Just point it to your reference code, and you can build up a component collection for the next thing if you like. As a distant second, becoming familiar with design terminology allows you to steer better. Fold, hero, inline, flow, things like that. You don't need to know the code but if you can explain what it should look like you can complain to the LLM more efficiently. Also, the model matters. I've found Opus 4.6 to be the best for web UI, but it probably matters what you're doing so experiment with your knobs a bit. reply",

I tend to start in Photoshop to mess around with ideas and synthesize a layout and general look and feel; everything you can do in there does translate to CSS, albeit sometimes obtusely. Anyways, I do a full-fidelity mockup of the thing, break it up in terms of structural layout (containers + elements), then get that into HTML (either by hand or LLM) with padding and hard borders to delineate holes to plug with stuff (not unlike framing a house) -- intentionally looks like shit. I'll then have Claude work on unstyled implementation (ex. just get all the elements and components built and on the page) and build out the site or app (not unlike running plumbing, electric, hanging drywall) After focusing on all the functionality and optimizing HTML structure, I've now got a very representative DOM to style (not unlike applying finishes, painting walls, furnishing and decorating a house) For novel components and UI flourishes, I'll have the LLM whip up isolated, static HTML prototypes that I may or may not include into the actual project. I'll then build out and test the site and app mostly unstyled until everything is solid (I find it much easier to catch shit during this stage that's harder to peel back later, such as if you don't specify modals need to be implemented via <dialog> and ensure consistent reuse of a singular component across the project, the LLM might give you a variety of reimplementations and not take advantage of modern browser features) Then at the end, once the water is running and the electricity is flowing and the gas is turned on, it's so much easier to then just paint by numbers and directly implement the actual design. YMMV, this process is for if you have a specific vision and will accept nothing less -- god knows for less important stuff I've also just accepted whatever UI/UX Claude spits out the first time because on those projects it didn't matter. reply",

Often I rewrite whole components whether with another pass of ai or manually. In the meantime I have workable placeholder faster than I can manage anything frontend.

Once the codebase has been established with enough examples of components, I tend to remove the skill as it becomes unnecessary context. So I think of the design skills as a kind of training wheel for the project. Not to promote my own work, but I am working on what I think is the right solution to this problem. I'm creating an AI-native browser for designers: https://matry.design I have lots of ideas for features, but the core idea is that you expose the browser to Claude Code, OpenCode, or any other coding agent you prefer. By integrating them into a browser, you have lots of seamless UX possibilities via CDP as well as local filesystem access. reply",

Overall, it's a huge downgrade from Claude Code's UX (no way to manually enter plan mode, odd limitations, poor Xcode-specific tool use adherence, frustrating permission model), but in one key way it is absolutely clutch for SwiftUI development: it can render and view SwiftUI previews. Because SwiftUI is component based, it can home in on rendering errors, view them in isolation, and fix them, creating new test cases (#Preview) as needed. This closes the feedback loop on the visual side. There's still a lot of work to be done on the behavioral side (e.g. it can't easily diagnose gesture conflicts on its own). reply",

The text contained only my thoughts, but the AI formatted them. However, no matter how much I tried to prohibit constructions such as \"It's not X, it's Y!\", it still added them. I had to revise 10 drafts before I had the final version. When I stopped using AI for my texts, my productivity increased, and I can now complete an essay in 1-2 drafts, which is 5 times faster than when using AI. This is strikingly different from development. In development, AI increases my productivity fivefold, but in texts, it slows me down. I thought, maybe the problem is simply that I don't know how to write texts, but I do know how to develop?\nBut the thing is, AI development uses standard code, with recognized patterns, techniques, and architecture. It does what (almost) the best programmer in their field would do. And its code can be checked with linters and tests. It's verifiable work. But AI is not yet capable of writing text the way a living person does. Because text cannot be verified. reply",

I used to skim slack threads and get the gist in 30 seconds. now half the messages are these perfectly structured five-paragraph responses to a yes/no question and I just... stop reading. honestly I think the root cause is that most corporate communication shouldn't exist at all. the AI just makes it easier to produce more of nothing. before chatgpt people would write a two-line email that said the same thing, and that was fine. what worked for our small team was pretty blunt - we just started replying 'tldr?' to anything that felt padded. no accusation about AI, just 'this is too long for what it's saying.' took about two weeks before people started self-editing. not sure that scales to a big org tho reply",

          "text": "You’re describing a real coordination problem: over-polished, abstraction-heavy “AI voice” increases cognitive load and reduces signal. Since you don’t have positional authority—and leadership models the behavior—you need norm-shaping, not enforcement.\nHere are practical levers that work without calling anyone out: 1. Introduce a “Clarity Standard” (Not an Anti-AI Rule)\nDon’t frame it as anti-AI. Frame it as decision hygiene.\nPropose lightweight norms in a team doc or retro: TL;DR (≤3 lines) required One clear recommendation Max 5 bullets State assumptions explicitly If AI-assisted, edit to your voice This shifts evaluation from how it was written to how usable it is.\nTypical next step:\nDraft a 1-page “Decision Writing Guidelines” and float it as “Can we try this for a sprint?” 2. Seed a Meme That Rewards Brevity\nSocial proof beats argument.\nExamples you can casually share in Slack: “If it can’t fit in a screenshot, it’s not a Slack message.” “Clarity > Fluency.” “Strong opinions, lightly held. Weak opinions, heavily padded.” Side-by-side:\nAI paragraph → Edited human version (cut by 60%) You’re normalizing editing down, not calling out AI.\nTypical next step:\nPost a before/after edit of your own message and say: “Cut this from 300 → 90 words. Feels better.” 3. Cite Credible Writing Culture References\nFrame it as aligning with high-signal orgs: High Output Management – Emphasizes crisp managerial communication. The Pyramid Principle – Lead with the answer. Amazon – Narrative memos, but tightly structured and decision-oriented. Stripe – Known for clear internal writing culture. Shopify – Publicly discussed AI use, but with expectations of accountability and ownership. You’re not arguing against AI; you’re arguing for ownership and clarity.\nTypical next step:\nShare one short excerpt on “lead with the answer” and say: “Can we adopt this?” 4. Shift the Evaluation Criteria in Meetings\nWhen someone posts AI-washed text, respond with: “What’s your recommendation?” “If you had to bet your reputation, which option?” “What decision are we making?” This conditions brevity and personal ownership.\nTypical next step:\nStart consistently asking “What do you recommend?” in threads. 5. Propose an “AI Transparency Norm” (Soft)\nNot mandatory—just a norm: “If you used AI, cool. But please edit for voice and add your take.” This reframes AI as a drafting tool, not an authority.\nTypical next step:\nAdd a line in your team doc: “AI is fine for drafting; final output should reflect your judgment.” 6. Run a Micro-Experiment\nOffer: “For one sprint, can we try 5-bullet max updates?” If productivity improves, the behavior self-reinforces. Strategic Reality\nIf the CEO models AI-washing, direct confrontation won’t work. Culture shifts via: Incentives (brevity rewarded) Norms (recommendations expected) Modeling (you demonstrate signal-dense writing) You don’t fight AI. You make verbosity socially expensive. If helpful, I can draft: A 1-page clarity guideline A Slack post to introduce it A short internal “writing quality” rubric A meme template you can reuse Which lever feels safest in your org right now? reply",

I’m now at a company building a deeply distributed systems product, and I’m surrounded by incredibly talented engineers who seem exceptionally strong at what they do. They often have knowledge and intuition about things I barely understand.<p>Lately, I’ve been feeling inadequate — like I’m contributing more to the less exciting parts of the product rather than the “cool” or core engineering challenges.<p>On top of that, I’m an immigrant and my wife and I are expecting. Balancing that with a fully remote job has been difficult, and at times I feel like I’ve lost some of my competence or sharpness. I’m taking steps to address this — I’ll be speaking with a psychologist soon — but I genuinely wonder: how does someone overcome these feelings while working within a high-functioning engineering team?</p></p></div>",

When I first started working I felt like I should quit before they figured out I didn’t know anything. I felt like I always had to go ask other people questions. At a certain point, that dynamic flipped and I was spending all day answering questions from other people. These days, it’s more balanced. There are things I go to others for, and I think they’re brilliant at what they do. Those people also come to me for help on things I have more experience in. It’s a give and take.

          "text": "Imposter syndrome is a thinking trap.  A couple of things you can do to help: Try to separate out 'ruminating' from 'thinking'.  What's the difference? For our purposes 'thinking' has a fixed outcome and an end point.  Trying to solve a coding problem. Working out how to make dinner. Calculating your taxes. When you reach your goal, you're done and you stop.  'Ruminating' has no end point. There is not end or action associated with it.  The tricky part is that it often masquerades as thinking, so you feel like you're solving a problem. For example, you do a job interview and you go over and over what happened in your mind. \"Maybe I should have answered this differently\". \"Maybe I should've prepared some more of these questions\".  Of course, you can't change what happened in the past. You're just rolling the ideas around in your head and probably making yourself feel worse and worse.  Rumination can be focused on the past, the future or even some hypothetical, imaginary situation (\"What if I lost my job\", \"What if my house burnt down\"). Again, actual preparation (Saving an emergency fund. Getting insurance) has an action associated, but rumination never ends, it just keeps going around in your head. The other thing is to keep an accurate record of your performance. This will be different for everyone, and varies a lot depending on the job.  The key thing is to make the record as close in time to the action as possible.  For example, you feel like your pull requests aren't as good as other people's. Don't wait until the end of the week and then reflect on the quality of your work. Instead, every time your make a pull request, write down an accurate, objective assessment of the quality. People who suffer from imposter syndrome tend to forget their wins and remember their losses again and again (there's that rumination!). By having an accurate record that you made yourself you can cut through this and show to yourself your true performance. reply",

          "text": "Imposter syndrome is the result of pretending to be something you know to be false. That might come from getting in over your head by dishonesty during a job interview or it could come from an employer setting unrealistic expectations and you lying about compatibility to retain employment. To solve for imposter syndrome the following steps must occur: 1. Apply introspection. Know exactly why you are not qualified and try to figure out how you got there. 2. Talk to your supervisor about this. See if they can work with you or help you with training options. 3. Stop being afraid, because it’s time to man up. Realize you have some work to do to catch up outside the office. If you are so unqualified that you can never catch up then it’s time to start exploring other options much sooner than later. Don’t put this off hoping it will fix itself, like a coward. I spent 15 years as a JavaScript developer. That is the land of perpetual imposters. Nobody knows what they doing in JavaScript as your regular corporate employee and will lie through their teeth about it while putting on a face saving show and simultaneously crying on the inside. The constant insecurity was so toxic. reply",

There are no runtime errors - just wrong results.<p>The main challenge is figuring out where things went wrong. The issue could be in an early reasoning step, how context is passed between steps, or a subtle mistake that propagates through the system. By the time I see the final output, it’s not obvious which step caused the problem.<p>I’ve been using Langfuse for tracing, which helps capture inputs and outputs, but in practice I still end up manually inspecting each step one by one to diagnose issues, which gets tiring quickly.<p>I’m curious how others are approaching this. Are there better ways to structure or instrument these workflows to make failures easier to localize? Any patterns, tools, or techniques that have worked well for you?</p></p></p></div>",

I, and most people I work with, have had success using the chatbots and Cursor-style tools and more recently Claude Code to accelerate the process of writing code.<p>Yet, with a few people in my network, it's like they're living 10 years ahead. Guys are automating everything in their jobs, spinning up 10 specialized agents at a time and running multi-agent pipelines, just doing all sorts of crazy things with this tech that I just can't even fathom. It seems like it's making them way more productive.<p>I have found a way to fit code-writing and question-answering chatbots into my workflow. I have NOT done the same in terms of these crazy Agent setups. There's clearly a way to leverage these tools to turbocharge your productivity, like at least 2x or maybe even 10x. But what is it?<p>Are there any Agentic power users out there who can enlighten me? What are the best ways to take advantage of these new tools?</p></p></p></div>",

How hard do the ideas bounce? Are you simply bolting on features? Are you debugging in a scientific method kind of way? Do you pair program with the AI? Think in combos, not as an individual step. What's your workflow? Compare to martial arts. You jab with the weaker arm. It sets up space. Rhythm. Forces a defense. Then you follow with a more committed hit with the stronger arm. Or if you were doing Muay Thai, a jab sets up the angle for a full kick or knee. It's your spirit. You decide if you prefer a solid jab-tip-roundhouse kick or multiple safe jabs. Don't think in terms of what prompts I can copy. Find what your workflow is and fit it. Like martial arts, the foundations usually make the difference more than the technicalities. Footwork. Stances. Guards. Balance. Pull the shoulder back that way when you kick, not the other way. All these things that are difficult to learn from a video, and harder still if you only meet each other 10 mins a day in stand up. In code, it's your style guides, architecture, tech debt, documentation (specifically where ), design systems. Multi-agent is simply combos. You know what your next steps will be, so you duplicate yourself, and automate yourself for those positions. Iterate over it. It's more like painting than printing. reply",

If you are automating something that isn't high impact or important, sure just let it write the code and don't even verify it. But in a big org, you'll need to validate it on every step, every generated line of code can have bugs, injections and negative side-effects. I believe you'll be more productive by using it, and prompting well, but you'll need to invest much more time on double-checking if everything is working accordingly to what you initially planned, or you might ship very broken code in production that can be difficult to revert, at a times. 2x productivity is possible, but it really depends on the kind of tasks you get. If your entire job is prototyping stuff, sure you are now 100x+. But if you need to write very complex business logic that will last for years, with lots of back and forth and discussions with PMs and whatnot, which is the majority of SWE corporate jobs... my bet you'd be at maximum 1.5x! reply",

I used to get surveys these yearly at a past job from the Boston Globe / Best Places to Work and it was basically a third-party email to all employees with a survey you'd fill out. The most anyone could realistically ask you to do was please fill out the survey positively to try and support the company if you believe it's a best place to work and remind more people to complete the surveys. I don't think companies are really out here trying to game the more reputable surveys, and it would be pretty easily for single employees to defect/report if they were.

Current employees shouldn’t need an external poll to tell them if people are happy or not. Where I work is almost always on these lists. In my experience it is highly dependent on department. I didn’t realize this until transferring to an office that had very few IT workers. Everyone in IT seemed miserable, while everyone outside of IT seemed extremely happy. I once made a rather sarcastic and cynical joke in the elevator to someone in a customer support role and it went over like a led ballon… but that was the language of everyone I worked with in IT. It was wild to me how two departments sitting 50 feet from each other could have such drastically different cultures. On town halls, everyone in the chat is brimming with company pride, meanwhile the side chats from people in the IT org are full of cynicism and sarcasm, with everyone trying to understand if these people are real or just bots… but I think they’re real. reply",

          "text": "I never trust surveys of companies even if it is a reputable 3rd party.  There are too many ways to game such systems.  If I wanted real answers I would find out who works in the group(s) I might end up in and reach out to them via email if I can and then set up a call.  I would be honest and say I do not trust surveys of \"best places to work\" and would happily sign an NDA to not share their brutally honest answers.  Even that I would take with a grain of salt as they may think it is a test or trap. Convincing current employees may work on those that are isolated but if one works in a toxic environment they will likely know it.  There was a time I would have semi-trusted sites like f'd company of long ago but those get infiltrated, sued and ultimately compromised by corporations that do not like people airing their dirty laundry and also gamified by their competitors. If a new position turns out to be a crap-show I would just leave and not add it to my CV.  If an individual manager is the issue, those come and go.  I have found it very easy to make them explore new opportunities. reply",

Day to day use,  your developers development environment should not have access to any data that comes under HIPAA (the one compliance framework I’m familiar with) If your developer machines don’t have access to regulated data, neither will Cursor.  As far as I know none of those compliance frameworks have anything to do with your code, it’s about accessing data and how you promote your code to production I’ve never used cursor.  But Claude Code gives you the option of using AWS Bedrock hosted models - including Anthropomorphic.  You can sign a BAA with AWS.  Notice this is using Anthropic models through an AWS account - not directly from Anthropic. reply",

I think some of the sliders were for \"popularity\", \"recency\" and perhaps \"author's score\". I also think, but I'm not sure, that the blog featured general ML topics.<p>I played with the sliders for sometime and had a great time exploring the blog, but I have since failed to find it again. I should've bookmark it then.<p>Does anyone have some clue about it? Much appreciated</p></p></p></div>",

Especially shorts with animated \"jumping\" captions and videos that zoom in and out every three seconds providing no useful content most of the time. I found it really frustrating that almost every tech conference talk ends up on YouTube, yet it's surprisingly hard to discover the ones I'd find interesting. So I wrote a script that fetches all the talks from the channels I follow each week, groups them by conference, and sorts them by view count. That way, I spend about five minutes a week and quickly find the really good ones. In 2024, I turned it into a newsletter. I use the exact same script and I just copy and paste the results into Substack. It turns out many people are facing the same problem because it grew to over 8,400 subscribers as of today. reply",

Couple of things give me confidence that the models actually do read them and follow them. 1) I have a sentence that says: \"I am your pairing buddy Bob. Occasionally address me by my name.\" And you will see them address you by the name, occasionally.\n2) I do have per project \"Project Tenets.\" Each tenets is a catchy couple of words, like Design for Agent First, Tolerant Interfaces over Robust Interfaces. If you notice the coding assistant referring to this you know they are aware, and they do sometimes refer to it. I also have a common list of principles but I think they are less useful because those are generic for software engineering.\n3) Occasionally, I will do the following prompt:\ni) Who am I?\nii) What is our design philosophy and tenets?\niii) Go through the repo and ensure the architecture and codebase adheres to our design philosophy and tenets.
