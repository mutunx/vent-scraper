I'm trying to build a simple tool that will let me visualize grid layouts.<p>It needs to toggle between landscape/portrait, and implement some design strategies so I can see different visualizations of the grid. I asked it to give me a slider to simulate the number of grids.<p>1st pass, it made something, but it was squished. And toggling between landscape and portrait made it so it squished itself the other way so I couldn't even see anything.<p>2nd pass, syntax error.<p>3rd try I ask it to redo everything from scratch. It now has a working slider, but the landscape/portrait is still broken.<p>4th try, it manages to fix the landscape/portrait issue, but now the issue is that the controls are behind the display so I have to reload the page.<p>5th try, it manages to fix this issue, but now it is squished again.<p>6th try, I ask it to try again from scratch. This time it gives me a syntax error.<p>This is so frustrating.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The truth is that there is a lot of hype. You need to be reasonably experienced and guide it. First, you need to know that Claude will create nonsensical code. On a macro level it's not exactly smart it just has a lot of contextual static knowledge. Debugging is not it's strongest skill. Most models don't do good at all. Opus is able to one-shot \"troubleshooting\" prompts occasionally, but it's a high probability that it veer of on a tangent if you just tell it to \"fix things\" based on errors or descriptions. You need to have an idea what you want fixed. Another problem is that it can create very convincing looking - but stupid - code. If you can't guide it, that's almost guaranteed. It can create code that's totally backwards and overly complicated. If it IS going on a wrong tangent, it's often hopeless to get it back on track. The conversation and context might be polluted. Restart and reframe the prompt and the problems at hand and try again. I'm not totally sure about the language you are using, but syntax errors typically happens if it \"forgets\" to update some of the code, and very seldom just in a single file or edit. I like to create a design.md and think a bit on my own, or maybe prompt to create it with a high level problem to get going, and make sure it's in the context (and mentioned in the prompts) reply",

There are 3 major steps: (Plan mode) 1. assuming this is an existing codebase, load the relevant docs/existing code into context (usually by typing @<PATH> 2. Ask it to make a plan for the feature you want to implement. Assuming you’ve already put some thought into this, be as specific and detailed as you can. Ask it to build a plan that’s divided into individually variable steps. Read the plan file that it spits out, correct and bad assumptions it made, ask it questions if you’re unclear one what it’s saying, refine, etc. (agent mode)\nAsk it to build the plan, one step at a time. After it builds each step  verify that it’s correct, or have it help you verify it’s correct in a way you can observe. I have been following this basic process mostly with Opus 4.5 in a mixture of claude code and cursor working on a pretty niche image processing pipeline (also some advanced networking stuff on the side) and have hand-written basically zero code. People say - “your method sounds like a lot of work too” and that’s true, it is still work, but designing at a high level how I want some CUDA kernel to work and how it fits into the wider codebase and then describing it in a few sentences is still much faster than doing all of the above anyway and then hand writing 100 lines of CUDA (which I don’t know that well). I’d conservatively estimate that i’ve made 2x the progress in the same amount of time as if I had been doing this without LLM tools. reply",

Potentially \"vibe-coding\" as in the sense: you don't know how to develop this yourself (perhaps you are not a software developer?) While this may be possible, it likely requires a very detailed prompt and/or spec document. --- Here is an example of something I successfully built with Claude: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app Apparently I have had over 150 chat sessions related to the research and development of this tool. - First, we wrote a spec together: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-transcription/blob/main/spec... - The spec broke down development into major phases. I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting. And after implementation, I often had to have Claude fix bugs in the implementation. - I tried to share the chat session where Claude got the first functional MVP working: https://opncd.ai/share/fXsPn1t1 (unfortunately the shared session is truncated) --- \"AI mistakes you're probably making\": https://youtu.be/Jcuig8vhmx4 I think the most relevant point is: AI is best for accelerating development tasks you could do on your own; not new tasks you don't know how to do. --- Finally: Cloudlflare builds OAuth with Claude and publishes all the prompts: https://hw.leftium.com/#/item/44159166 reply",

          "text": "Yes, it's a lot of spec work. But a lot of it is research and exploring alternatives. Sometimes Claude suggests ideas I would have never thought of or attempted on my own. Like a custom python websocket server: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-local (I also implemented the previous version with only a high-level, basic understanding of websockets: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app/sherpa ) I think of Claude like a \"force-multiplier.\" I have been able to implement ideas I previously gave up on. I can test out new ideas much faster. For example, https://github.com/Leftium/gg started out as 100% hand-crafted code. I wanted gg to be able to print out the expression in the code in addition to the value like python icecream. (It's more useful to get both the value and the variable name/expression.) I previously tried, and gave up. Claude helped me add this feature within a few hours. And now gg has its own virtual dev console optimized for interacting with coding agents. A very useful feature that I would probaly not have attempted without Claude. It's taken the \"open in editor\" feture to a completely new level. I have implemented other features that I would have never attempted or even thought about. For example without Claud's assistance https://ws.leftium.com would not have many features like the animated background that resembles the actual sky color. 60 minute forecast was on my TODO list for a long time. Claude helped me add it within an afternoon or so. Note: depending on complexity of the feature I want to add the spec varies in the level of detail. Sometimes there is no spec outside Claude's plans in the chat session. [1]: https://github.com/gruns/icecream reply",

In fact, this spec is a spin-off of several other specs on several other branches/projects. - I've actually experienced quite the opposite: I suggest an idea for the spec and Claude says \"great idea!\" Then I change my mind and go in the opposite direction: \"great idea!\" again. Once in a while, I have to argue with Claude to get my idea implemented (like adding dependencies to parse into a proper AST instead of regex.) - One tip: it's very useful to explain the \"why\" to Claude vs the \"what.\" In fact, if you just explain the why/problem without a specific solution, Claude's suggestions may surprise you! reply",

You can one-shot some things, and it makes for an impressive demo (oh yay, yet another video game made instantly) but anything larger and more useful will probably be a conversation. (Though not necessarily with a human, AIs can discuss it among themselves too.) Your first one-shot might be a good rough prototype. From there, you continue the conversation with your refinements. While Claude goes and works on that for 15 minutes - you can go and do other work. Or talk with another Claude in another window to make progress on another project. A good mental model is to imagine you're talking to a remote developer. You need to give them an extremely detailed spec on the first go if you expect them to get it right the first time. Sometimes it's better to explain \"this is my grand vision, but how about we first mockup a prototype to see if that's actually how I want it to work\". Sometimes Claude will suggest you talk about your plan together first to remove the ambiguities from the plan, or you can encourage Claude to do that with you. (Also, the remote developer mindset is useful - treat the remote developer with respect, with humanity, and they're more likely to be helpful towards you and motivated to align with your goals.) Consider that in an hour or two of conversation, you now have your app, completed, fully debugged... and not once did you look at the code, and you spent half of that time catching up on your other tasks.

The agentic harness of the software around the model (ie Claude Code) is important. Consider also that some of us have been doing this for a year and have already built our own MCP server tooling to go faster. Giving your AI the same kind of deterministic software tools that you use is important (eg make sure your AI has access to a diff tool, don't make it try and do that \"in its head\", you wouldn't ask that of a human). As for listening to Hacker News... yeah, this is one of the worst places (well, Mastodon is worse) and HN is surprisingly AI-doomerish. I don't check in here very often anymore, and as of this week I just get Claude to summarize HN headlines as a morning podcast for me instead. My own experience: my first few uses of Claude in Dec 2024 seemed rubbish, I didn't get it. Then one day I asked it to make me a search engine. The one shot from that wasn't perfect, but it worked, and I saw it build it in front of my eyes. That was the moment & I kept iterating on it. I haven't used Google or Kagi in almost a year now. Anyway, hope it helps, but if not using AI makes you feel more comfortable, go with what fills your life with more value & meaning & enjoyment. reply",

That is a very wrong approach, not just with Claude but with everything(you ask a woman for a date and if you do not get laid in five minutes you failed?). When I program something manually and compiles, I expect it to be wrong. You have to iron it and debug it. Instead of that: 1.Divide the work in independent units. I call this \"steps\" 2.Subdivide steps into \"subsets\"\nYou work in an isolated manner on those subsets. 3.Use an inmediate gui interface like dear imgui to prototype your tool. Translating then into using something else once it works is quite easy of LLMs. 4.Visualize everything. You do not need to see the code but you need to visualise every single thing you ask it to do. 5.Tell Claude what you want and why you want it and update the documentation constantly. 6. Use git in order to make rock solid steps that Claude will not touch when it works and you can revert changes or ask the ia to explore a branch, explaining how you did something and want something similar. 7. Do not modify code that already works rock solid. Copy it into another step leaving the step as reference and modify it there. 5.Use logs. Lots of logs. For every step you create text logs and you debug the problems giving Claude the logs to read them. 6.Use screenshots. Claude can read screenshots. If you visualise everything, clause can see the errors too. 7.Use asserts, lots of asserts, just like with manual programming. It is not that different from managing a real team of people... reply",

Last night I added an archive to the Daily Challenge mode, so if you missed a day's challenge you could go back and play it. This is what my initial prompt looked like: --- I'd like to add an archives mode to the daily challenge. This will allow players to complete any daily challenges they didn't attempt on the actual day. It will look like a calendar, with the dates in Green if it was played, and in white if not. The archive should only go back to January 30, 2026, the day the project started. Include a to do to change this date prior to release. Rewards for completing daily challenges via the archive should be 25% of the normal value. --- Claude Code then asked me a couple of clarifying questions before it harnessed the superpowers:writing-plans skill and generate a document to plan the work. The document it put together is viewable at https://gist.github.com/Jeremy1026/cee66bf6d4b67d9a527f6e30f... There were a couple of edits that I made to the document before I told it to implement. It then fired off a couple of agents to perform the tasks in parallel where possible. Once it finished I tested and it worked as I had hoped. But there was a couple of follow up things that would make it more intertwined with everything else going on around daily challenges. So I followed up with: --- lets give 1 cell for compelting an archived daily challenge --- And finally: --- Now that we are tracking completions, can we update the notification to complete daily mission to include \"Keep your X day streak\" --- reply",

          "text": "Another example is the tower stat caps. When Claude Code generate the first pass, it make it so that the tower level would control each individual stat's cap. Which was way too high. I didn't know exactly what the limits were, but knew they needed to be pulled back some. So I asked it: -Start Prompt- Currently, a towers level sets the maximum a single stat can be. Can you tell me what those stat caps are? -End Prompt- This primed the context to have information about the stat caps and how they are tied to levels. I followed up after it gave me a chart back with Tower Level and Max Stat Rank with some real stats from play -Start Prompt- Lets change the stat cap, the caps are currently far too high. All towers start at 1 for each IMPACT stat, my oldest tower is Level 5, and its stats are I-3, M-4, P-6, A-3, C-1, T-1. How do you think I could go about reducing the cap in a  way. -End Prompt- It came back with a solution to reduce the individual stat cap for individual stats to be tower level + 1. But I felt that was too limiting. I want players to be able to specialize a tower so I told it have the stat cap be total, not per stat. -Start Prompt- I'm thinking about having a total stat cap, so in this towers case, the total stats are 18. -End Prompt- It generated a couple of structures of how the cap could increase and presented them to me. -Start Prompt- Yes, it would replace the per-stat cap entirely. If a player wants to specialize a tower in one stat using the entire cap that is fine. Lets do 10 + (rank * 3), that will give the user a little bit of room to train a new tower. Since it's a total stat cap, if a user is training and the tower earns enough stat xp to level beyond the cap, lock the tower at max XP for that stat, and autoamtically level the stat when the user levels up the tower. -End Prompt- It added the cap, but introduced a couple of build errors, so I sent it just the build errors. -Start Prompt- /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerDetailView.swift:231:39 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'tower' is a 'let' constant /Users/myuser/Development/Shelter Defense/Shelter Defense/Views/DebugTowerEditorView.swift:181:47 Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'towerInstance' is a 'let' constant -End Prompt- And thus, a new stat cap system was implemented. reply",

It doesn’t work that way (not well, at least) The LLM under the hood is essentially a very fancy autocomplete. This always needs to be kept in mind when working with these tools. So you have to focus a lot on what the source text is that’s going to be used to produce the completion. The better the source text, the better the completion. In other words, you need to make sure you progressively fill the context window with stuff that matters for the task that you’re doing. In particular, first explore the problem space with the tool (iterate), then use the exploration results to plan what needs doing (iterate), when the plan looks good and makes sense, only then you ask to actually implement. Claude’s built in planning mode kind of does this, but in my opinion it sucks. It doesn’t make iterating on the exploration and the plan easy or natural. So I suggest just setting up some custom prompts (skills) for this with instructions that make sense for the particular domain/use case, and use those in the normal mode. reply",

This reminds me of someone who dropped into  #java on undernet once upon a time in the 90s. \"I can't get it to work\" , and we kept trying to debug, and for some reason we kept hitting random new walls. It just never would work!    Turns out that they were deleting their .java file and starting over each time.  Don't do that. --- Take it as a sequence of exercises. Maybe start like this: Don't use claude code at all to begin with. It's a pair programming exercise, and you start at the keyboard, where you're confident and in control. Have claude open in the web interface alongside, talk through the design with it while working; and ask to google stuff for you, look up the api, maybe ask if it remembers the best way(s) to approach the problem. Once you trust it a bit, maybe ask for code snippets or even entire functions. They can't be 100% correct because it doesn't have context... you might need to paste in some code to begin with. When there's errors, paste them in, maybe you'll get advice. If you're comfy? Switch seats, start using claude code. Now you're telling claude what to do. And you can still ask the same questions you were asking before. But now you don't need to paste into the web interface anymore, and the AI sure as heck can type faster than you can. Aren't you getting tired of every iteration where you're telling the AI \"this went wrong\", \" that went wrong\"? Maybe make sure there's a way for the AI to test stuff itself, so it can iterate a few cycles automatically.  Your LLM can iterate through troubleshooting steps faster than you can type the first one. Still... keep an eye on it. And, really that's about where I am now. reply",

In my little experience, what I've seen work is that you need to provide a lot of constraints in the form of: - Scope: Don't build a website, but build a feature (either user facing or infra, it doesn't matter). I've found that chunking my prompts in human-manageable tasks that would take 0.5-1 day, is enough of a scale down. - Docs .md files that describe how the main parts of the application work, what a component/module/unit of code looks like, what tools&technologies to use (and links to the latest documentation and quickstart pages). You should commit these to code and update them with every code change (which with Claude is just a reminder in each prompt). - Existing code, if it's not a greenfield project. It really moves away from the advertised paradigm of one-shot vibe-coding but since the quality of the output is really good these days, this long preparation will give you a production ready output much sooner than with traditional methods. reply",

There are some small things it never has managed to fix that I have to figure out myself, but again, I learn from that. Mapping out a data structure in advance and creating a plan before immediately coding can also help, but at least in our project, sometimes it just takes an incorrect approach and so I don't just let it go off and do things willy-nilly.

Opus is the first model that actually convinced me to use AI as my daily driver - and I’m a developer for about 20 years.\n2. Make the tasks as small and specific as possible. Don’t prompt „create a todo app with user login“ but „create a vue app where users can register, don’t do more than that“, then „build a user  login“ then, „create a page to create todo items“, then „create a page to list todo items“, then „on list page, add delete functionality“ - and so on, you get the idea.\n3. beware the context size. Claude code will warn you if you exceed it, but even before: the higher the context window, the higher AI will miss things. If you start a new prompt that doesn’t require the whole context of the previous one, type /clear. \n4. build an agents.md or Claude.md. /init will do that for you, but it will just create a Claude.md with information that it might think are important - but easily miss things. You know best. It often also includes file and directory structure, while it could easily find out again (tree command) without that info in agents/claude file. Still I recommend: let Claude create that file, then adjust it to your needs. Only add important stuff here. The more you add, the more you spam the context. Again, try to keep context small. \n5. if Claude needs a long time for finishing a task or did it wrong at first attempt, tell it to update the Claude.md with information to not do the same mistakes the next time again.\n6. make sure you understand the code it created. Add conventions to agents.md that will make the code more readable (use early returns, don‘t exceed nesting level of 3, create new methods with meaningful names instead of inline comments etc.) Good luck! reply",

Can make some debugging and fixing that usually requires looking the stack, look the docs and check the tree \n3. Code is spaghetti all way down. One might say it is ok because it is fast to generate, but the bigger the application, every change gets more expensive and it always forget to do something.\n4. Tests it generates is mostly useless. 9/10 times it always passes on all tests it creates for itself but the code does not even start. No matter what type of test.\n5. Frequently lied about the current state of the code and only when pushed it will admit it was wrong. As others said, it is a mix of the (misnomer) Danny Kruger effect and some hype. I tried possibly every single trick to get it working better but I feel most are just tricks. They are not necessarily making it work better. It is not completely useless, my work involves doing prototypes now and then and usually they need to be quite extensive. For that it has been a help.

The idea is, you want to build up the right context before starting development. I will either describe exactly what I want to build, or I ask the agent for guidance on different approaches. Sometimes I’ll even do this in a separate Claude (not Claude Code) conversation, which I feel works a bit faster. Once we have an approach, I will ask it to create an implementation plan in a markdown file, I clear context and then tell it to implement the plan.

I had the newest Claude Code (4.6?) look over the tests on the day it was released and the issues it found were really, really bad. Now, the newest plan is to produce a tool which generates the tests from a DSL so they can't be made to pass and/or match buggy code instead of the clearly defined specification. Oh, I guess I didn't mention there's an actual spec for what we're trying to do which is very clear, in fact it should be relatively trivial to ensure the tests match for some super-human coding machine. reply",

          "text": "The problem is that it’s being marketed like it’s magic and will make people obsolete… not as a tool with a high learning curve. I don’t blame people for being upset when it can’t do what all the hype says it will do. The way people talk about the latest Claude Code is the same way people were talking 2-3 years ago about whatever the latest model was then. Every release gets marketed as if it’s a new level of magic, yet we’re still here having the same debates about merit, because reality doesn’t match the marketing and hype. It has gotten better, I tried something with early ChatGPT that failed horribly (a basic snake game written in C), and just tried the exact same thing again last week and it worked—it wasn’t good, but it technically worked. But if it took 3 years to get good enough to pass my basic test, why was I being fed those lies 3 years ago? The AI companies are like the boy who cried wolf. At this point, it’s on them to prove they can do what they say, not up to me to put in extraordinary efforts to try and get value out of their product. Last week I sat through a talk from one of our SVPs who said development is cheap and easy now, then he went on about the buy vs build debate for 20 minutes. It’s like he read a couple articles and drank the kool-aid. I also saw someone talking about ephemeral programs… seeing a future where if you want to listen to some MP3s, you’ll just type in a prompt to generate a bespoke music player. This would require AI to reliably one-shot apps like Winamp or iTunes in a few words from a layperson with no programming background. These are the ideas the hype machine is putting in people’s minds that seem detached from reality. I don’t think the, “you’re holding it wrong”, type responses are a good defense. It’s more that it’s being marketed wrong, because all these companies need to maintain the hype to keep raising money. When people use the AI the way the hype tells them it should work… it doesn’t work. reply",

          "text": "I don't think that's true, I've seen examples to the contrary. Here for example a recent article [1] from a non programmer building a tool. The article is long so I pasted the relevant part below. My thoughts go more in the direction, the article author built something that is complicated for non technical people, but in essence simple -- he says it so himself \"copy paste\". What if what the OP here is building is something novel and Claude doesn't know how to build it? Relevant excerpt: I spent a bit of time last month building a site to solve a problem I’ve always found super-annoying about the legislative process. It’s hard to read Federal bills because they don’t map to the underlying code. Anyone who has worked in Congress knows what I mean, you get a bill that says “change this word from ‘may’ to ‘shall’ in section XYZ of Federal law.” To understand what it does, and find possible loopholes they are trying to sneak in, you have to go to that underlying Federal law and look at where it says “may” and then put “shall” in there and read it. It’s basically like a manual version of copy and pasting, except much more complicated and with lawyers trying to trick you. So I wrote an app that lets you upload legislation, and it automatically shows you how it changes Federal law. There are commercial versions of this software, and some states do it for their proposed legislation. But I haven’t seen anything on the Federal level that is free, so I built it. (The code is here.) It’s not very good. It’ll probably break a lot. There’s no “throat to choke” if you use it and it’s wrong. And my guess is that Anthropic or Gemini ultimately will be able to do this function itself eventually. But the point is that if I can build something like this in my spare time and deploy it without any training at all, then it’s just not that hard for an organization with some capital to get rid of some of its business software tools.

The assumption was that using common 3D printer measurement tools (like for bed-leveling) would provide a way to read back whatever data was encoded onto the surface.<p>Since that seems like a pretty well-known concept, crudely applied to a domain I haven't seen it in before - but is already large and growing fast - I'm assuming that others have thought of this? I was hoping maybe someone had implemented something like it?\nAnd then, obviously, if that proof of concept exists, I'd wonder about some kind of advanced version that used specialized equipment for the reading (and possibly the writing/printing).<p>In any case, I'm just curious. I was thinking about long term (century +) archival storage, or encryption keys only stored as the print with no digital copies. Stuff that wouldn't need tons of storage, but would be crucial to maintain statically. It probably wouldn't be useful for that, which is why I assume I'm not finding much in my searches for it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew about it, in case there is stuff it's good for.</p></p></div>",

Exotics like laser engraved metal plates or ceramics might be better if you have a lot of data and can’t guarantee your storage will be fire and flood free. If you don’t have a lot of data you can also think of engraving it into stone or press it into a clay tablet and fire it. These mediums are known to be very stable even in adverse circumstances. reply",

But... is anyone doing that with a 3D printer? Or a CNC machine, for that matter? I think some of the other answered showed that people are, it's just pretty niche.

This is him trying to FOMO listeners into using his project. From what I've observed, the people trying to use herds of agents to work on different things at the same time are just using tokens as fast as possible because they think more tokens means more progress. As you scale up the sub-agents you spend so much time managing the herd and trying to backtrack when things go wrong that you would have been better off handling it serially with yourself in the loop. If you don't have someone else paying the bill for unlimited token usage it's going to be a very expensive experiment. reply",

Especially with the latest models which pack quite a long and meaningful horizon into a single session, if you prompt diligently for what exactly you want it to do. Modern agentic coding spins up its own sub-agents when it makes sense to parallelize. It's just not as sexy as typing a sentence and letting your AI bill go BRR (and then talking about it). I'd like to see some actual results with a meaningful benchmark of software output that shows that agent orchestrators accomplish any meaningful improvement in the state of the art of software engineering, other than spending more tokens.

A lot of the safety guardrails we need don't even exist yet. I'm working on all that currently. Trying to set up local systems to do practical and secure orchestrated AI work, without over-reliance on proprietary systems and platforms. Turns out it's a buttload of work. Yegge's own project (Gas Town) is a real world attempt to build just the agent part, and still many more parts are needed. It's so complicated, I don't think any open source solution is going to become dominant, because there's  too much to integrate. The company that perfects this is going to be the next GitHub and Heroku rolled into one. I get why people question all this. It's a completely different way of working that flies in the face of every best practice and common-sense lesson you learn as a software developer. But once you wrap your head around it, it makes total sense. You don't need to read code to know a system works and is reliable. You don't need to manually inspect the quality of things if there's other ways to establish trust. Work gets done a lot faster with automation, ironically with fewer errors. You can use cutting-edge technology to improve safety and performance, and ship faster. These aren't crazy hypothetical ideals - what I just described is  modern auto manufacturing. If it's safe enough for a car, it's safe enough for a web app. reply",

The best pattern I've seen: give each agent clear module boundaries (not file-level, but architectural). Think micro-services even in a monolith. Then each agent owns its domain end-to-end.

          "text": "I stopped manually writing code 6-9mo ago, and am generating high-quality code on the dimensions we care about like GPU perf benchmarks, internal & industry conformance standards test suites, evals benchmarks, lint/type checkers, etc. It's not perfect code - there are clear AI slop tell tales that review cycles still let linger - but it's doing more ambitious things than we'd do on most dimensions like capability, quality, and volume. We're solving years-old GPU bugs that we had given up on as mere mortals. And yes, we build our own orchestrator tech, both as our product (not vibes coding but vibes investigating), and more relevant here, our internal tooling. For example, otel & evals increasingly drive our AI coding loops rather than people. Codex and claude code are great agentic coding harnesses, so our 'custom orchestration' work is more about more intelligently using them in richer pipelines, like the above eval-driven loop. They've been pretty steadily adding features like parallel subagents that work in teams, and hookable enough to do most tricks, that I don't feel the need to use others. We're busy enough adapting on our own! reply",

Just use the \"ultra\" power saving mode your current phone has. It's not a fully universal advise, but usually it will make your screen turn grayscale, disable background services, replace your launcher with a much simpler one and then allow you to add 3-5 apps to use. On my phones it's configurable (like, you can keep colors, etc). You can still use 5G and read email, use an IM. But you have to prioritize and your notifications are severely limited. I personally consolidated all mail to Thunderbird mobile which checks mail every 3-4 hours only and it had zero impact on me (I can always refresh manually if I need to confirm login email etc). reply",

Today, it's not possible (for me.) Authentication is a big part of it. My (web) access to my bank demands a selfie photo on my phone. Plus endless other systems. Outside of work, all communications is via WhatsApp. I pretty much don't even read SMS's anymore. They're 99% spam or scam. And it's not just person to person, all social activities from church to sport to band etc are all on WhatsApp. I use maps only a couple times a year, but when I need it, I really need it (cause I'm not where I expected to be.) I don't do social media, or email, on the phone. Both if which frankly lead to problems in some situations. I'm traveling this year and the number of tickets (train and museum) that can only be used from a phone is impressive. I applud your desire to remove the phone from your life, especially if you are distracted by it. But you may find that it's hard to do. I'm not interested in \"work arounds\", I want to get stuff done, not fight everything about my life. So I recommend, get a dumb phone and use that.

          "text": "Maybe think about what it was like before they were everywhere. Peoples' recollections might not be that accurate, and watching old TV shows may not help much, but think what it means to you and how you would thrive like so many people did and many still can. Now with the smartest of phones you can put your communication on steroids and do more other things by far, but just because you can doesn't mean you should. I never even got a cellphone until I had been in business for over a year, then it was only because I wanted clients to be able to reach me 24/7.  Decades ago they were already popular but not really common yet. When I got my first smartphone they were still monochrome and just got you on the internet as a wireless dial-up modem, connecting by the built-in IR sensors to your laptop's little port before there was USB which became available in later years. And it was pretty good because it was usually way faster than 56K, which most people didn't even get when they had a premium land-line modem. But it was also pretty expensive by the minute so only useful when there was just no landline available. So it's quite easy for me to refrain because I'm old enough to remember how it was before these were even here. Eventually I had a Sony smartphone in the flip-phone format which was way more capable than the iPhone was, but it was decades and calls and text were still enough to keep me busy so I never had time for any apps on the small screen, especially when I was long used to having the full internet on my x86 laptop whenever I want. I kept my final Sony-Ericsson as long as could, and one of the nicest features was it was not Android nor iOS, but eventually all its frequencies were discontinued. So got a run-of-the-mill touchphone not that many years ago for the first time, and Android is worse than I thought. The experience is so \"rewarding\" that it's even easier reverting to how it was before there were even cellphones at all, which I also remember well. So most of the time it doesn't even come with me, just leave it sitting there on the desk at home or office and mainly carry it in between, or in a vehicle if I'm going to be gone a long time. Touchphones are so bulky (and delicate) compared to everything I was accustomed to, that it's a drag to carry around anyway, and ends up more so than ever, without planning, back to serving more like a good old land line stuck to the desk than anything else. So that's the switch I made and it was no effort at all, just let nature take its course :) reply",

You then take a photo of the cracked bone and feed it back to your coding agent, which has been properly trained in interpreting Oracle Bones to extract PR review comments. If the PR is too big too fit on the bone, you reject it for being too big. If after three rounds of review the bones keep cracking in the same spot, reject the PR.

          "text": "So before the gate keeping starts, my first crack at optimizations was in 1987 on a 1 MHz Apple //e 1. I wrote the code in BASIC 2. I wrote the code in assembly 3. I got more improvement because storing and reading from the first page of memory took two clock cycles instead of 3. But this isn’t 1986, this is 2026. I “vibe coded” my first project this year.  I designed the AWS architecture from the an empty account using IAC, I chose every service to use, I verified every permission,  I chose and designed the orchestration, the concurrency model, I gathered requirements.  What I didn’t do is look at a line of Python code or infrastructure code aside from the permissions that Codex generated. Now to answer your questions : How did I validate the correctness? Just like if I had written it myself.  I had Codex to create a shell script to do end to end tests of all of the scenarios I cared about and when one broke, I went back to Codex to fix it. I was very detailed about the scenarios. The web front end that I used was built by another developer.  I haven’t touched web dev in a decade. I told Codex what changes I needed and I verified the changes by deploying it and testing it manually. How did I validate the performance? Again just like I would do on something I wrote.  I tested it first with a few hundred  transactions to verify the  functionality and then I stress tested it with a real world amount a transactions.  The first iteration broke horribly.  Not because of Claude code.  It was a bad design. But here’s the beauty.  It took me a day to do the bad implementation that would have taken me three or four days.  I then redesigned it, didn’t use the AWS service and did I designed that was much more scalable and it took a day.  I knew in theory how it worked under the hood.  But not in practice.  Again I tested for scalability by testing the result. The architectural quality? I validated it by synthesizing real world traffic.  ChatGPT in thinking mode did find a subtle concurrency bug.  That was my fault though.  I designed the concurrency implementation, Codex just did what I told it to do. Subtle bugs happen whether people write it or an agent writes it.  You do the best you can with your tests and when they come up you fix it? How do I prevent technical debt? All large implementations have technical debt. Again just like when I lead a team - I componenitize everything with clean interfaces.  It makes it easier for coding agents and people. reply",

It can explain topics in more detail, or it can tell you that the thing you asked will be explained later in the book. And it will allow you to skip material that you are already familiar with. Provide references to other resources, etc.<p>Maybe ingesting an entire book is too much for current LLMs, but I'm sure there are ways around that.<p>Note: I am __not__ trying to build such a tool myself.</p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It seems like we are in the midst of another AI hype cycle. Many people are calling the current coding models an \"inflection point\", where now the capabilities are so high that future model growth will be explosive. I have heard serious people, like economics writer Noah Smith, make this argument [0].<p>But it's not just the commentariat. I have seen very serious people in software engineering and tech talk about the ways in which their coding habits have change drastically.<p>Benchmarks [1] alone don't seem to capture everything, although there have been jumps in the agentic sections, so maybe they actually do.<p>My question is; what explains these big jumps in capabilities that many serious people seem to be noticing all at once? Is it simply that we have thrown enough data and compute at the models, or instead, are labs perhaps fine-tuning models to get really good at tool calls, which leads to this new, surprising behavior?<p>When I explain agents to people, I usually walk them through a manual task one might go through when debugging code. You copy some code into ChatGPT, it asks you for more context, you copy some more code in, it suggests and edit, you edit and run, there is an error, so you paste that in, and so on. An agent is just an LLM in that loop which can use tools to do those things automatically. It would not be shocking to me if we took weaker models like Claude Opus 4.0 and made it 10x better at tool calls, it would be a much stronger and more impressive model. But is that all that is happening, or am I missing something big?<p>[0] https://substack.com/@noahpinion/p-187818379<p>[1] https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "> Model T to 2026 Camry was an amazing shift without really changing the combustion engine. A lot of times the big jumps in internal combustion engine development have been down to materials science or manufacturing capability improvement. The underlying thermodynamics and theoretical limits have not changed, but the individual parts and what we make it out of have steadily improved over time. The other factor to this is the need for emissions reduction strategies as a overriding design factor. The analogue to these two in LLMs are: 1. The harnesses and agentic systems-focused training has gotten better over time so performance has increased without a step change in the foundation models. 2. The requirements for guardrails and anti-prompt injection and other concepts to make LLMs palatable for use by consumers and businesses. reply",

          "text": "This is why the saying has always been “reduce, reuse, recycle” in that order. Reducing is the best. Don’t buy or make surplus stuff, and that reduces waste overall. Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible. Installing Linux on an old laptop to keep it useful for somebody is easy to do, and much more effective than trying to recycle it. reply",

For example, is the legislation you're thinking of like the deprecation of plastic bags for paper? Or something that covers a much wider amount of consumption? (C) If (A) is \"yes\" or (B) is \"more global\", at huge scales like an economy, legislating quotas or rationing or anything at all, in practice pushes activity onto black markets.

          "text": "In addition to the volume issue, there's the composition issue.  When I was a kid, we recycled all our flint cores.  Well, not quite that far back...  Milk came in glass bottles, and the person who delivered the bottles of milk to our house picked up the empties to take back to the dairy.  There were also steel cans for canned food and soft drinks (which eventually rusts away), and of course lots of other glass bottles.  Now more and more of those kinds of things come in plastic, of which little gets recycled.  And cans are often aluminum, which doesn't rust away. Furniture was wood and fabric and (maybe) springs, with a little bit of pressboard (which was itself recycled paper and textile, usually used on the back of desks etc.).  Now furniture is particleboard (made from sawdust), with lots of glue and some kind of plastic veneer if it's in a place that shows.  Wood is genuinely recyclable (or re-usable as antiques!); I don't think particleboard is recyclable, although I could be wrong. Automobiles were steel, fabric, glass and copper wire (with rubber insulation); plus of course rubber tires.  Now they are those things plus a lot more plastic.  Tires, both then and now, are essentially un-recyclable (although occasionally turned into artificial reefs). I could go on, but there are probably more authoritative (= better) studies of this.  But I suspect in general that we have lots less recyclable \"stuff\" these days than we used to. reply",

          "text": "The ultimate reason is there isn't economic reason so.  It cost's a lot to recycle anything, and most electronics would net you almost nothing valuable. Let's look at an example.  Let's say your phones main board, which will net a few hundred grams of raw materials.  First thing by weight the actual board itself is probably the biggest,  if you could perfectly decompose it to it's parts you would have some fiberglass, glue, a few grams of copper, and maybe a trace amount of gold. Next you would have the different components, mostly ICs but let's cover them next.  These are mostly plastic with bits of copper, tin, and other more exotic metals. Most of these could be used again, if you can separate them and sort them.  There would be a bunch of solder, which maybe could be reused, if you remix it with more flux.  Finally, you'll have chips, these could be reused, but only as replacements for the same chip.  Getting anything out of these would mostly be removing the bulk of the material which is silicon that's been contaminated with other elements to make the semiconductors.  I don't think there is any process right now that could take doped Si and get you anything back.  Besides the silicon you have micrograms of gold and other conductors. Having put all that down, I think there could be an opportunity to take the bulk components off boards, test and sort them, and sell them in bulk. reply",

Many times the only viable option to fix something is to swap a board, or replace the entire item, instead of replacing the one failed component that caused the board to fail, or reflowing the board etc.. Many components also do not offer batteries that can be replaced, such as the magic mouse, so you end up needing to replace the entire item. It's interesting how as certain things age, such as cars, cottage industries pop up to do just that when new replacement boards and parts are not available. The other issue is cost cutting. Many components are made cheaply and fail pre-maturely. Great examples of this are mains voltage LED bulbs where the rectifier circuits that power the LED's fail, but the only real option is to replace the entire thing, creating a lot of e-waste in the process. reply",

I think we're better off lobbying for better standards to communicate the quality of a bulb's design.  The whole reason we have crappy LED bulbs to begin with is because the $3 overdriven bulb with crap components jammed into a tiny enclosure looks like a better deal on the shelf than a bulky $20 bulb with a large heat sink and lower output. And the labor required to do component level repair is wildly expensive and limited (YouTubers who do it on principle notwithstanding), even further narrowing that window. reply",

Not that I think lightbulbs are probably worth saving, but expand it to any other device which gets exponentially more complex and it is easy to see why they don't get diagnosed, not to mention repaired. With a board diagram I can point at a spot on the board and say \"I should see 15 volts here\", without a board diagram i gotta draw out and figure out how the power supply even works so I know what it is suppose to be outputting and then trace that all the way to the test point to make sure there isn't other crap inline before then that might change what I see. reply",

If it is cheap to replace, they will just get a new one.  If it was a big investment, then it's important enough to call a professional to fix.  In the middle ground you've got people who will ask their handy nephew to try to fix it before they run out to the store, and he'll open it up and look for a blown fuse or a loose wire before giving up.  The type of people who can do board level repairs are so rare as to be completely irrelevant to the waste stream of electronics.

Appliance repair use to be big business. Did it stop being so because washers and TVs and vacuums became too complicated to understand, or the parts went up in cost, or because $1000 is considered cheap enough of a device to be considered disposable? No. They stopped existing because appliances stopped coming with the reference materials to repair them in a reasonable time and parts are obfuscated from their source so people don't even know what their broken part is half the time. Is that a thermistor, a capacitor, a diode that blew up? Have fun spending the next 2 hours tracing the obfuscated part number down through 5 different suppliers to figure it out because you obviously can't test a broken part and there is no schematic to look at and identify it from. reply",

They have fewer mechanical parts prone to regular failure or which pay the bills for repair shops (belts, timers, etc) 4. They are far more complicated than their predecessors, and therefore more complicated to diagnose even if you have a schematic But yeah, when everyone’s washing machine has a belt transmission and a clunky mechanical timer, they failed all the time and there were repair shops on every corner.

          "text": "There was a cartel, but this is one of those \"more complicated than it appears\" situations. In incandescent bulbs, there is a real tradeoff between durability of the bulb, efficiency (lumens/watt), and brightness/quality of the light, for physics reasons you _can't_ improve one without degrading the other. Since \"quality of light\" is a very difficult thing to market, there was an incentive to push \"lifetime of the bulb\" in marketing and just make the light quality increasingly worse. The cartel attempted to halt that by making everyone agree on a lifetime/quality to hit and not participate in a race to the bottom (and yes, there was also the obvious benefit to the cartel members of increased sales and profits, which they explicitly talked about in internal documents). I want to be very clear that I'm anti cartels and I'm not trying to say \"so this was all hunky dory\", just that this was not (and these things very rarely are) a simple case of \"they made the product objectively worse for the sole sake of more money\". Instead, they chose a different point on the pareto-frontier of brightness/efficiency/lifespan that also had the benefit of making them more money. But yes, LED bulbs are currently mostly garbage and have terrible heat/power management electronics which means that in practice you almost never get anywhere close to the theoretical life span increases (because the electronics die from overheating far before the actual LEDs themselves would go out), and finding out information on how well a given bulb brand does on heat/power management is essentially impossible. reply",

The obvious Nash Equilibrium involves increasingly hot/bright/efficient bulbs and as much lying about lifetime as a typical consumer would accept, which is a lot. The idea behind the Phoebus Cartel was to force honesty on the dimension where it was most likely to disappear. You are free to disapprove of this and reject bulb lifetime policing, but if so you support the \"everybody lies\" alternative. Pick your poison. reply",

The truth is that they become hazardous waste, and lock away valuable resources inside of trash. The reality is that there is no real economic benefit to the current model of ever increasing sales of new goods.

Electronics are the exact opposite of this: they’re highly heterogenous, with bits of material scattered all over the place. Also, most of that material isn’t particularly valuable: silicon is literally as abundant as sand. So all you can really do is melt it all into slag or dissolve it in acid and then try to extract the trace amounts of valuable bits like gold, but this is so energy-intensive for so little material that it’s not worth it at any reasonable material price. reply",

      "title": "Ask HN: We're building a saving app for European savers and need GTM advice",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN, I'm Alessandro, founder of unflat.finance. We're an Italian startup building a stablecoin yield app for everyday Europeans people who have never touched a wallet, don't know what Morpho is, and have no interest in learning.<p>What we do today: Users deposit euros via cooinbase pay. We convert to USDC, split their deposit across multiple isolated Morpho vaults on Base chain (each with different collateral types and borrowers pledging 150-200% of what they receive), and they earn 4-7% APY. They see one number: their balance growing daily. No wallet, no gas fees, no tokens. We have apps built for both iOS and Android, currently in beta.<p>The market context: This category is exploding in the US. Axal (a16z CSX, $2.5M), Nook (Coinbase Ventures, $2.5M, ~7.6% avg APY, built by ex-Coinbase/Uber team), YieldClub ($2.5M), and Aave itself launched a consumer savings app with up to 9% APY and $1M deposit protection. They're all live or in waitlist. They all run on the same proven infrastructure (Morpho has had $8.5B in peak deposits, 25+ audits, backed by $69M from a16z and Coinbase Ventures, used by Société Générale).<p>But they're all US-first. ACH, Plaid, Apple Pay, USD-denominated. Europe 350M+ banking customers sitting at near-zero rates — has no equivalent. In the US you can get 4-5% at Marcus or Wealthfront. In Europe, most banks pay 0.5% or less. The yield gap here is wider, and nobody is serving it.<p>That's our bet. We're also working on EURc (Circle's euro stablecoin) integration so the entire flow stays euro-denominated — no FX exposure. That's something no US competitor can replicate.<p>What we want to build next: An AI agent that automates portfolio allocation based on each user's risk profile. You answer a few questions about risk tolerance, time horizon, goals the agent handles vault selection, rebalancing, entry/exit across DeFi strategies. Think Wealthfront/Betterment for crypto, not another trading bot. The multi-vault architecture on Morpho makes this natural: different risk profiles map to different vault compositions.<p>Where I need help:<p>Go-to-market for non-crypto users in Europe: Our target is the person with €10-50K in a savings account earning nothing, not crypto Twitter degens. Every crypto marketing channel attracts the wrong audience. We're running a waitlist with tiered bonuses (+2% APY for first 500 users, referral bonuses), but how do you actually reach normal savers? Has anyone cracked fintech distribution in Europe without burning cash on Meta/Google ads (which are restricted for crypto anyway)?<p>Driving traffic to the site: SEO/GEO is slow, content marketing takes months to compound, paid ads for crypto are a minefield. What's actually moved the needle for early-stage fintech in Europe? We're bootstrapped, so capital-efficient channels matter.<p>Trust for non-crypto users: We lead with radical transparency — every user gets a public on-chain link showing every deposit, earning, and withdrawal. We put risk disclaimers front and center (\"this is not a bank account, never deposit what you can't afford to lose\"). But is that enough? What trust signals actually convert skeptical Europeans?<p>The stablecoin savings app category is being defined right now. YC literally listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest Requests for Startups. We think Europe is the bigger opportunity — the yield gap is wider and nobody's building here yet. Would love to hear from anyone who's built in this space.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Nobody using our product needs to know what a blockchain is. They see a savings account with a better rate that's it.\nMeanwhile: Stripe acquired Bridge for $1.1B for stablecoin rails. Société Générale is building on Morpho. Coinbase routes lending through it. YC just started offering checks in stablecoins and listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest RFS.\nThis isn't \"crypto\" anymore. It's on-chain finance the same way \"the internet\" stopped being a category and became invisible plumbing. European banks pay 0.5%. Overcollateralized on-chain lending pays 4-7%. That spread exists because banks capture the margin. We remove the middleman.\nThe people who \"want to stop the insanity\" are exactly our users. They don't want crypto. They want their savings to not lose value. We just use better rails. reply",
