It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate. I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.) I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

          "text": "Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them. Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

Gmail is (was?) overly aggressive flagging things as spam, so I have the client-side Bayesian filter check Gmail’s spam folder and rescue good email, so long as rspamd also says it’s not phishing. And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus. I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham. If Gmail has been lax at filtering spam lately, I haven’t noticed, but perhaps the Bayesian filter has been picking up the slack. reply",

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.  If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways). reply",

The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

Right now I'm mostly using parakeet v3 on my desktop, but it tends to do a bit more errors, although it is very fast. I cycle betwen it and Distil-Whisper Large V3.5, which is a bit slower. On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content. I'm going to give canary-1b-v2 a try next weekend.

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "It really depends by what you mean by \"it works\". A retrospective of the last 6months. I've had great success coding infra (terraform). It at least 10x the generation of easily verifiable and tedious to write code. Results were audited to death as the client was highly regulated. Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We're nowhere near full agentic coding. However, by reinvesting the speed gains from not writing boilerplate into devex and tests/security, I bring to life much better quality software, maintainable and a boy to work with. I suddenly have the homelab of my dreams, all the ideas previously in the \"too long to execute\" category now get vibe coded while watching TV or doing other stuff. As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want. Most importantly though, and I've heard this from a few other seniors: I've found joy in making cool fun things with tech again. I like that new way of creating stuff at the speed of thought, and I guess for me that counts as \"it works\" reply",

          "text": "Same experience here. On some tasks like build scripts, infra and CI stuff, I am getting a significant speedup. Maybe I am 2x faster on these tasks, when measured from start to PR. I am working on a HPC project[1] that requires more careful architectural thinking. Trying to let the LLM do the whole task most often fail, or produce low quality code (even with top models like Opus 4.5). What works well though is \"assisted\" coding. I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks. It seems to match what I see from the PRs I am reviewing: we are getting these slightly more often than before. --- [1] https://github.com/finos/opengris-scaler reply",

What I'm deeply skeptical of is the ability for agentic to integrate with a team maintaining+shipping a critical offering.

You have to tell it to use async where possible, to do proper error handling and logging, xml comments above complex methods and so on. It works really well once you got it figured out. It also helps to give it separate but focussed tasks, so I have a todo.txt file that it can read to keep track of tasks. Basically you have to be strict with it. I cannot imagine how people trust outputs for python/javascript as there are no strong typing or compilers involved, maybe some linting rules that can save you. Maybe Typescript with strict mode can work but then you have to be a purest about it and watch it like a hawk, which will drain you fast. C# + claude code works really well. reply",

          "text": "Upvote. That's my experience too. Agent coding works really well for existing codebases that are well-structured and organized. If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it). This is where I see clear efficiency gains. reply",

          "text": "I use Augment with Claud Opus 4.5 every day at my job. I barely ever write code by hand anymore. I don't blindly accept the code that it writes, I iterate with it. We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools. I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools. A few very concrete advantages I've found: * I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away. * It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not. Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well: 1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you. 2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea. 3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step. 4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...). 5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.) This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial. reply",

In my experience reading discussions like this, people seem to be saying that they don't believe that Claude Code and similar tools provide much of a productivity boost on relatively open ended domains (i.e. the AI is driving the writing of the code, not just assisting you in writing your own code faster).

I have recently added a step before that when beginning a project with Claude Code: invoke the AskUserQuestionTool and have it ask me questions about what I want to do and what approaches I prefer. It helps to clarify my thinking, and the specs it then produces are much better than if I had written them myself. I should note, though, that I am a pure vibe coder. I don't understand any programming language well enough to identify problems in code by looking at it. When I want to check whether working code produced by Claude might still contain bugs, I have Gemini and Codex check it as well. They always find problems, which I then ask Claude to fix.

I'm not expert enough in JS to, e.g., know the cleanest method to inspect and modify the DOM, but I can look at code that does and tell if the approach it's using is sensible or not. Surely you've had the experience of a domain where you can evaluate the quality of the end product, even if you can't create a high quality product on your own? Concretely in this case, I'd implemented an approach that used jQuery listeners to listen for DOM updates. Antigravity rewrote it to an approach that avoided the jQuery dependency entirely, using native MutationObservers. The code is sensible. It's noticeably more performant than the approach I crafted by hand. Antigravity allowed me to easily add a number of new features to my extension that I would have found tricky to add by hand. The UI looks quite a bit nicer than before I used AI tools to update it. Would these enhancements have been hard for an expert in Chrome extensions to implement? Probably not. But I'm not that expert, and AI coding tools allowed me to do them. That was not actually the main thrust of my post, it's just a nice side benefit I've experienced. In the main domain where I use coding tools, at work, I work in languages where I'm quite a bit more proficient (Golang/Python). There, the quality of code that the AI tools generate is not better than I write by hand. The initial revisions are generally worse. But they're quite a bit faster than I write by hand, and if I iterate with the coding tools I can get to implementations that are as good as I would write by hand, and a lot faster.

If someone who were expert in JS looked at a relatively simple C++ program, I think they could reasonably well tell if the quality of code were good or not. They wouldn't be able to, e.g., detect bugs from default value initialization, memory leaks, etc. But so long as the code didn't do any crazy templating stuff they'd be able to analyze it at a rough \"this algorithm seems sensible\" level\". Analogously I'm quite proficient at C++, and I can easily look at a small JS program and tell if it's sensible. But if you give me even a simple React app I wouldn't be able to understand it without a lot of effort (I've had this experience...) I agree with your broad point: C/C++/Java are certainly much more complex than JS and I would expect someone expert in them to have a much easier time picking up JS than the reverse. But given very high overlap in syntax between the four I think anyone who's proficient in one can grok the basics of the others. reply",

Give Claude a task that's not particularly open ended, the closer to pure \"monkey work\" boilerplate nonsense the task is, the better (which is also the sort of code I don't want do deal with myself). Preferably it should be something that only touches a file or two in the codebase unless it is a trivial refactor (like changing the same method call all over the place) Make sure it is set to planning mode and let it come up with a plan. Review the plan. Let it implement the plan. If it works, great, move on to review. I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another. If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue. If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself. Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works. I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder. This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker. I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source. It's pretty good for that. This idea of having an army of agents all working together on the codebase is hilarious to me.

I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version. Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files. Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it. It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version. The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well. reply",

Particularly interesting because I didn't expect this to work, let along not to write any code. Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (\"Heart Rate 76bpm\"), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use. Every file is claude generated.

It took about a day for the whole thing and cost around $25. further edit: I am by no means an expert with Claude (haven't even got to making a claude.md file); the one real objective here was to get a working example of using dBus to talk to blueZ in C, something I've failed at (more than once) before. reply",

You have to be really valiant and verify everything from top to bottom, if you want to control how things are implemented to that degree, otherwise the agent will still take shortcuts where they can. In https://github.com/lowrescoder/BlueHeart/blob/68ab2387a0c44e... for example, it doesn't actually do SSE at all, instead it queues up a complete HTTP response each time, returns once and then closes the stream, so basically a normal HTTP endpoint, \"labeled\" as a SSE one. SSE is mentioned a bunch of times in the docs, and the files/types/functions are labeled as such, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on internally, from what I could understand.

No, that's been established since Karpathy coined the term; you don't review the code, only use the agent and don't care about how it was done, just about the results. The actual interesting stuff is how to use LLMs together with a human, to build high quality code. More \"augmenting the human intellect\" rather than \"autonomous robots building for you\". Overall I'd say if someone handed you a specification that named SSE specifically, you created files with SSE in the name, and the implementation talks about doing SSE, yet it doesn't actually do SSE in the end, it's pretty much on par with code in commercial settings, yeah :) But maybe our bar should be slightly above the ground at least? :) reply",

Adding the HTTP server again would be easy if the developer also had experience of that (n.b. there was a minor compiler error when I tried it on another system due to a slightly different version of libmicrohttpd). Adding the API would be straighforward (but tedious) and similiarly the web page (the web page was an one-shot after Claude wrote the API, vis. \"Create a web page to display a real time plot with history using the API\").

The other day I gave an estimate to my co-worker and he said \"but how long is it really going to take, because you always finish a lot quicker than you say, you say two weeks and then it takes two days\". The LLMs will just make me finish things a lot faster and my gut feel estimation for how long things will take still is not yet taking that into account. (And before people talk about typing speed: No that isn't it at all. I've always been the fastest typer and fastest human developer among my close co-workers.) Yes, I need to review the code and interact with the agent. But it's doing a lot better than a lot of developers I've worked with over the years, and if I don't like the style of the code it takes very few words and the LLM will \"get it\" and it will improve it.. Some commenters are comparing the LLM to a junior. In some sense that is right in that the work relationship may be the same as towards a (blazingly fast) junior; but the communication style and knowledge area and how few words I can use to describe something feels more like talking to a senior. (I think it may help that latest 10 years of my career a big part of my job was reviewing other people's code, delegating tasks, being the one who knew the code base best and helping others into it. So that means I'm used to delegating not just coding. Recently I switched jobs and am now coding alone with AI.) reply",

Typescript, Svelte, Go, Postgres. This week I have been making the drawing tools more powerful (not deployed publicly yet). * Gesture recognition to turn wobbly lines into straight lines in some conditions * Auto-fill closed shapes: Vector graphics graph algorithms to segment the graph and compute the right fill regions that feel natural in the UI (default SVG fill regions were not right, took some trial and error to find something that just feels natural enough) * Splines to make smoother curves .. fitting Catmull-Rom, converting those to other splines for SVG representation etc * Constraints when dragging graph nodes around that shapes don't intersect when I don't want them to etc I haven't been working all that much with polygon graphics before, so the LLM is very helpful in a) explaining me the concepts  and b) providing robust implementations for whatever I need. And I've had many dead ends that didn't feel natural in UI that I could discard after trying them out in full, without loosing huge investment. These are all things that are very algorithm and formula intensive and where I would have had do to a lot of reading and research to do things right myself. (I could deal with it, but it takes a lot of time to read up on it.) I review to see that it \"looks sensible\", not every single addition and division in the spline interpolations, or every step of the graph segmentation algorithms used to compute fill regions. I review function signatures and overall architecture, not the small details (in frontend -- obviously the backend authorization code is reviewed line by line..) reply",

          "text": "That fear is good, it means you know that you're taking a risk - I'd worry if you had to touch production and didn't feel that fear. If you only have the one or two production systems/databases, and you're having to do this more than a couple of times each year, then you could certainly benefit for improving your tooling. But if you've inherited a large number of production systems, each with their own local database instance. Then implementing new tooling will be a long process that you might not be able to get Management to agree to. When I have to touch a production database, I usually use the following steps: 0. Follow your organisation's Change Processes (i.e. if you need to put in a change request and get approval then do that) 1. Snapshot the server itself (VMs are great for this) 2. Backup the database (just be careful not to leave that backup anywhere open, and remember to clear it up when you no longer need it) 3. Write the SELECT version of your SQL first (If you need to delete a record from the userSessions table with an ID of 123, then start by writing SELECT * FROM userSessions WHERE id=123; 4. If that shows you just the rows you'd expect then convert it to the delete from of the SQL (making sure that you don't change any part of the WHERE clause) DELETE FROM userSessions WHERE id=123; 5. Get someone else, who also understands the database, to check your SQL 6. Run your SQL 7. Do all your sanity checks to make sure that production is working as expected. 8. If it does go wrong then you have more ammunition to use when trying to convince Management to spend some resources on improving your tooling for these sort of changes. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "This doesn't sound like a particularly difficult problem for some scenarios. It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

Further, while you included products that run on the computer, you didn't include the computer itself and key figures like Turing, Von Neumann, This was dependent on the transistor and the folks around Claude Shannon.  And the whole digital life we know today derives from things like the Apollo Program in the 1960s, Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, MIT Instrumentation Lab, etc.  And none of these electronics breakthroughs would have been possible without Quantum Theory and Relativity bringing us Bohr and Einstein and all their successors.  Not to mention James Clerk Maxwell and his equations.  And this is just the technology side of the question.  Get into biology/medicine, etc. and the list explodes further. the double helix discovery (Crick & co), Harvey and blood circulation.  The list is endless.  Move into the government/political realm and the significance of things like the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, and the US Constitution cannot be overstated.

Looked at the code, and wouldn't you know they let the LLM decide... Once started down this path, I knew I was going to need something for isolated exec envs. I ended up building something I think is quite awesome on Dagger. Let's me run in containers without running containers, can get a diff or rewind history, can persist and share wvia any OCI registry. So on one hand, I needed something and chose a technology that would offer me interesting possibilities, and on the other I wanted to have features I don't expect the likes of Microsoft to deliver with Copilot, only one of which is my sandbox setup. I'm not sure I would call it rolling my own completely, I'm building on established technology (OCI, OCR) I don't expect a standard to arise, OCI is already widely adopted and makes sense, but there are other popular techs and there will be a ton of reimplementations by another name/claim. The other half of this is that AI providers are likely to want to run and charge money for this, I personally expect more attempts at vendor lock in in this space. In example, Anthropic bought Bun and I anticipate some product to come of this, isolation and/or canvas related reply",

Today, he argued, the goal of modern management is Utilization (removing every micro-second of downtime).<p>His quote: \"We deleted the 'waiting,' but we forgot that the waiting was the only time the human got to breathe.\"<p>I feel like I see this exact pattern in Software Engineering now.

It's also not new in software. I had a manager tell me I didn't spend enough time typing (he'd never written a line of code after college), even though I'd written quite a bit but not enough code apparently. He liked heroic coders, the sort I usually ended up cleaning up after because they spent too little time thinking and too much time typing, producing products that couldn't be maintained because they had multi-thousand line functions and grotesque for loops containing the bulk of the logic. reply",

          "text": "I’m constantly arguing for more slack in the system. Too many managers treat knowledge work like it’s a factory. I ran a team for about a year and was constantly pushing them to do less. The team were the ones trying to pile on more work, a force of habit I think. I noticed that when we planned less, people finished faster (probably due to greater focus and a quick finish in sight), then they pulled more into the sprint and ended up getting more done. We actually went faster when we tried to do less. I’m hoping that being told to slow down all the time meant it wasn’t actually stressful for them either. I always wanted to have slack in the system so we weren’t having to perform heroics and pull all-nighters to meet arbitrary deadlines. If something came up, we could fit it in, because we weren’t overloading ourselves. And when nothing came up, we flew. I stepped back into an IC role, as I didn’t really enjoy running things. The person who took over was skeptical of how I had done things, but was told to try going with it, since we had been so successful. Overtime there was some regression. After a couple more management changes, we are the polar opposite. Everyone is stressed and it seems like very little actually gets done, because everyone is stretched so thin on too many projects at once. Everyone looks really busy though, I guess that’s all that matters anymore. reply",

Having a whole 2nd engine on a passenger plane seems wasteful, until the first engine fails. When attempting to apply a process optimisation perspective from supply chains or manufacturing to software delivery, one way the software delivery problem space differs is that the software delivery process isn't a process that produces a stream of identical units that are independent of each other. Suppose we abstract the software situation, we can tell ourselves that it is a repeatable process that produces an endless stream of independent features or fixes (weighed in \"story points\" say) that get shipped to production. This mental model maybe works some of the time, until it doesn't. In reality, each software change is often making a bespoke, one-off modification or addition to an existing system. Work to deliver different features or fixes are not fungible and delivering the work items may not be independent -- if changes interfere with each other by touching overlapping components in the existing system and modifying them in incompatible ways.  A more realistic mental model needs to acknowledge that there's a system there, and its existing architecture and accumulated cruft may heavily constrain what can be done, and that the system is often a one-off thing that is getting changed in bespoke ways with each item of work that ships. reply",

          "text": "Yes, and it’s now up to us as managers to engineer that ebb and flow as part of the process. Don’t assign too much work all the time. Make sure that the employees feel excited and rewarded for their hard work (don’t just dump another pile on their desk). Make sure their work is diverse enough so they are not stuck doing the same slog all the time. \nMake sure the employee sees the big picture of the company - this is how your work is contributing to our mission (the janitor at nasa isn’t sweeping the floor, he’s helping put a man on the moon). When boring work must be done tell them you know it’s boring but all of us have to shovel gravel sometimes, it’s just part of life, but there’s a bit of fun on the other side of it. Be interested in the employees - what are their personal goals over the next 12 months? Learn their dogs name, learn their hobbies, be interested in them as a human and then TRY HELP THEM get to their personal goals. If they want to get fit then block out an hour gym time and send them off to it. Encourage them to bring you new ideas, support them to try out the new ideas - if it doesn’t work out then “hey no problem” but if it does work out tell everyone in the company very publicly and make a lot of noise about it. Don’t criticise them in public, take them aside and help them be better. And lastly, is someone isn’t working out, or is causing cultural problems - get rid of them, it’s harming more than you think. Don’t micromanage - assign the work, support them and then get the hell out of the way. Good managers will do all of this simultaneously. Bad managers just try to cram as much work in as possible. Because they are so poor at evaluating the quality of what their employees are doing, the only thing they understand is maximise throughput at the expense of all else.

Follow up in a few days, and send a short (20 seconds max) video attached in case they don’t have time to organise to see the demo.

To the extent you could get an LLM to state such a thing, it would be specious and still not binding. Someone calling the airline support line and assuming the airline agent is authorized to form general contracts doesn't change the legal situation where they are not, right? Fundamentally, running `sdkmanager --licenses` does not consummate a contract [0]. Rather running this command is an indication that the user has been made aware that there is a non-negotiated contract they will be entering into by using the software - it's the continued use of the software which indicates acceptance of the terms. If an LLM does this unbeknownst to a user, this just means there is one less indication that the user is aware of the license. Of course this butts up against the limits to litigation you pointed out, which is why contracts of adhesion mostly revolve around making users disclaim legal rights, and upholding copyright (which can be enforced out of band on the scale it starts to matter). [0] if it did then anyone could trivially work around this by skipping the check with a debugger, independently creating whatever file/contents this command creates, or using software that someone else already installed.

I'm not saying that at all. Agency law is very mature at this stage, and the test to determine that an actor is an agent and whether it acted within the scope of its authority is pretty clear. I'm not going to lay it all out here, so please go study it independently.

The closest analogy we have, I guess, is the power of attorney. If a principal signs off on power of attorney to, e.g. take out a loan/mortgage to buy a thing on principal's behalf, that does not extend to taking any extra liabilities. Any extra liabilities signed off by the agent would be either rendered null or transferred to the agent in any court of law. There is extent to which agency is assigned. The core questions here are agency and liability boundaries. Are there any agency boundaries on the agent? If so, what's the extent? There are many future edge cases where these questions will arise.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hello :-)<p>I have a Discord server I set up a long time ago. Around 2016 I think. Back then, it was lively and active and loads of fun. Over time it's developed close to 5,000 members (it actually had over 5,000 members at one point) and currently has 501 members online as I type this. It's more likely there's about 10-15 that are paying attention to anything happening.<p>It's a Discord that originally focused on DevOps. It complemented my YouTube channel on the same topic, but since then, as it's slowly died out, and my channel's focus as shifted and changed, it's become a bit of a waste land.<p>It's a shame really, because a really fun Discord server can be a great place to be, but I'm not sure where to take it now.<p>How would you handle this situation? What would be your approach to reviving the Discord and perhaps trying to get a community of like minded hackers going again in 2026?<p>I won't link the Discord here as I'm not trying to beg for users or spam. I just genuinely want to work on a solution to improve the life of the server. I will put it in my HN profile, though, so if you do want to check it out that extra step is required.<p>Are people even interested in Discord servers any more? I don't know.<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

You could potentially find ways to better complement the new focus of the channel and see if that brings new excitement to your Discord. (Are there enough channels for your shifted focus? Are you posting your videos to them? Do people have things to say about the new focus?) Most of what keeps a Discord active or not is content and having things to chat about. You list things in an order that suggests the chat started to slowly die and then your channel's focus shifted, but maybe it was the other way around and not as much as of the audience that had found their way through the Discord followed you through the channel refocus as you expected? reply",

          "text": "These days the out-of-the-box automod and autospam prevention tools in Discord are generally good enough you probably don't need third party bots to do it (unless the community gets particularly huge, and even then maybe not). Most bots are now for entertainment more than community management when the Discord is configured right. The biggest trick to getting access to most of those built-in features is that it needs to be marked as a \"Community Server\" [1], so expect to put in the effort to meeting those requirements and getting Discord certified on them. Most of them are good practices in general , especially for something you are trying to present as a public, professional face of your company. Also, I don't think any moderation tools are currently gated behind Server Boosts/Levels, but it may also be worth budgeting for buying a Server Level or two [2]. Most of the reasons to budget for that are marketing and comfort. If you plan to do things like Live Q&A or screensharing events, having the better audio/video capabilities of higher levels can be useful. The custom header for Discord Invites is often a marketing tool to help assuage users seeing the invites that it is indeed the right official community. (Some of the moderation tools were previewed at higher Server Levels, and it does seem like something Discord takes into account when testing various new, desirable features.) (ETA: Also, automoderation only gets you so far in general, you may still want to budget for the labor of real moderators as well, no matter how good you think you can configure the automod tools.)

(One alleged place where it came from was communities migrating from TeamSpeak where \"server\" was the word there, which would make sense as a particular place it came from given the early focus on game players. Another alleged source was some huge non-technical communities that were also early adopters of Discord.) I sort of prefer \"guilds\" for technical reasons, too, and also from enough work on Discord bot development where that terminology is far more common because it is in all the API documentation. But I think a lot of that ship has sailed for non-technical reasons of \"it is just how everyone talks about Discord\". (Also, technically Discord does shard the heaviest \"guilds\" in its server clusters in such a way that the technical resemblance to \"server\" isn't far off if you want to feel better about the non-technical \"server\" terminology.) reply",

It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs.

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

They're a more or less faithful remake of the Commodore 64 but have an HDMI port, SD card instead of disk drive, etc. You could learn BASIC, should be able move to assembly as well—a quick search pulled up a YouTube course on 6502 assembly for the Commodore [2].

My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites.

You could really “see” what the program was doing.<p>At the same time, it’s clearly a product of a different era:<p>– single-process<p>– mostly synchronous code<p>– no real notion of concurrency or async<p>– dated UI and interaction model<p>Today we debug very different systems: multithreaded code, async runtimes, long-running services, distributed components.<p>Yet most debuggers still feel conceptually close to GDB + stepping, just wrapped in a nicer UI.<p>I’m curious how others think about this:<p>– what ideas from DDD (or similar old tools) are still valuable?<p>– what would a “modern DDD” need to handle today’s software?<p>– do you think interactive debugging is still the right abstraction at all?<p>I’m asking mostly from a design perspective — I’ve been experimenting with some debugger ideas myself, but I’m much more interested in hearing how experienced engineers see this problem today.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I always point to the Metal-API debugger in Xcode for what I'd want a CPU debugger to look like, visualizing dependencies and dataflows with an actual graphical UI, letting me view data as something else than just hex dumps (e.g. as image or 3D mesh), etc... etc... Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.)

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm wondering if a shift has occurred. When I started as a junior software engineer, over a decade ago, I learned about unit testing, integration testing, system testing. The whole codebase we worked on was thoroughly unit tested, and had layers of integration tests and system tests as well. I've worked for other employers since and in some cases any kind of automated testing was completely absent. Still, the message I got when reading and keeping up with best practices was: unit test ALL the things!<p>I've personally found that when the architecture of the system is not mature yet, unit tests can get in the way. Terribly so. Integration tests or system tests to assert behavior seem the starting point in this and other scenario's, including when there are no tests at all yet.<p>I've recently read a statement about letting go of a strict \"unit test everything\" mindset and go for integration tests instead. I'm thinking it probably depends, as with everything, on the type of system you're working on, the maturity of the system, the engineers' experience with automated testing, etc.<p>I'd be interested to learn when each type of testing helps you and when it gets in the way (and what it gets in the way of).</p></p></p></div>",

The software under test is always modeling something -- business logic, a communications protocol, a control algorithm, a standard, etc. Behind each of those things is a specification. If a specification doesn't exist then the software is called a prototype. For sustained long term incremental development a specification must exist. The purpose of unit tests is to assert specification-defined invariants at the module interface level. Unit tests are durable iff the specification they uphold is explicit and accessible to developers and the scope of the test is small. It's futile to write good tests for a module which has ambiguous utility. priors: I worked in embedded SW and am now a PhD student. reply",

          "text": "My rule of thumb: unit test logic, integration test plumbing. If a function does actual computation or has branching logic that could go wrong in subtle ways, unit test it. If it's mostly wiring things together (fetch data, transform, save), an integration test catches more real bugs. The \"unit test everything\" era came from a time when spinning up test databases was painful. Now with Docker and in-memory DBs, integration tests are often faster to write AND more useful. Where unit tests still win: algorithmic code, parsing, anything with lots of edge cases. Writing unit tests forces you to think about boundaries. Integration tests just tell you \"it worked this time.\" The worst outcome is having tests that make refactoring painful but don't catch real bugs. I've seen codebases where every internal method signature change breaks 50 unit tests that were essentially testing implementation details. reply",

          "text": "Something I've noticed: most of these techniques work partly because they force you to slow down and actually think about what you're asking. The \"ask for contrasting perspectives\" prompt is annoying specifically because it makes you process more information. The devil's advocate approach forces a second round of evaluation. Even just opening a fresh session adds friction that makes you reconsider the question. When I'm working in domains I know well, I catch the model drifting way faster than in areas where I'm learning. Which suggests the real problem isn't the model - it's that we're outsourcing judgment to it in areas where we shouldn't be. The uncomfortable answer might be: if you're worried the model is reinforcing your biases, you probably don't know the domain well enough to evaluate its answers anyway. reply",

Don't ask it to confirm something; ask it to outline the possibilities and the pros and cons or argument for or against each possibility. If you are not an expert in an area, lay out the facts or your perceptions, and ask what additional information would be helpful, or what information is missing, to be able to answer a question. Then answer those questions, ask if there's now more questions, etc. Once there are no additional questions, then you can ask for the answer. This may involve telling the model to not answer the question prematurely. Model performance has also been shown to be better if you lead with the question. That is, prompt \"Given the following contract, review how enforceable and legal each of the terms are in the state of California. <contract>\", not \"<contract> How enforceable...\". Ask the model for what the experts are saying about the topic. What does the data show? What data supports or refutes a claim? What are the current areas of controversy or gaps in research? Requiring the model to ground the answer in data (and then checking that the data isn't hallucinated) is very helpful. Have the model play the Devil's advocate. If you are a landlord, ask the question from the tenant's perspective. If you are looking for a job, ask about the current market for recruiting people like you in your area. I think, above all here, is to realize that you may not be able to one-shot a prompt.

If I need it to argue from another perspective, I just ask for that perspective in a new session, ideally arguing both sides in temporary sessions so that the context of any other session doesn't affect it. I am also quite good at playing the devil's advocate myself. If you have some expertise, you can just come up with what I consider to be a good counterargument, and ask for an attack or defense of that argument. You can try the prompt below in your favorite thinking model and see what it says. Obviously, this is more work than some other methods. --- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following line of argumentation? Some proponents of climate-change denialism have taken a new tact: pointing out that there is a lack of practical solutions that meaningfully address the change in climate, especially given the political and social systems available. To the extent that climate mitigations are expensive, they will tend to be politically unpopular in democracies, and economically destabilizing in dictatorships. Unilateral adoption of painful solutions weakens a country's relative position among nations; it wouldn't do for, say, China to harm itself economically while the rest of the world enjoys cheap energy. We also have a gerontocracy in most countries; the people in power have no personal stake in the problems 50 years from now, and even as the effects of climate change start to become a problem, those in power are best positioned to be personally insulated. And while there are solutions like solar power that are capital intensive but pay for themselves over time, the sum total of these net positive solutions doesn't amount to a meaningful dent in the problem, nor do we need policies or willpower to support \"no-brainer\" solutions that pay for themselves. The conclusion is that negative effects of climate change are \"baked in\" by the lack of a political system (\"benevolent\" dictatorship) that could force the necessary and painful changes required, hence the entire discussion of climate change, while interesting, is partly moot. Do these people have a point? Is there evidence that we can build an effective solution from non-painful measures? Why would it matter to those in power today, what the global average temperature in 2100 is? reply",

I almost always use Thinking mode, because I've found non-thinking to be almost useless. There are rare exceptions. 'Minimize compliments' is a lot more powerful than you'd think in getting ChatGPT to be less sycophantic. \nThe parts about calculation work okay. It's an improvement over defaults, but you should still verify. \nIt's better at working with text, but still fucks it up a lot.\nThe instructions about handling factual information work very well. It will push back on my or its own claims if they're unsupported. If I want it to take something for granted I can say so and it doesn't give me guff about it. \nI want to adjust the prompt so it pays more attention to the quality of the sources it uses.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Apple introduced App Clips in iOS 14 as a way to instantly use small parts of an app without installing the full application. The idea seemed compelling: low friction, fast launch, contextual entry points (QR, NFC, links).<p>Five years later, I almost never encounter App Clips in the wild and Google killed Instant Apps already.<p>- Are there notable apps or companies where App Clips are a meaningful acquisition or engagement channel?<p>- Did you already decide to remove your App Clip to reduce maintainability?</p></p></p></div>",

It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate. I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.) I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

          "text": "Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them. Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus. I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.  If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways). reply",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We're nowhere near full agentic coding.

As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want.

I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks.

Now I have a Go backend that crawls my NAS every night, indexes files to a FTS5 sqlite database with minimal metadata (size + mimetype + mtime/ctime) and a simple web frontend I can use to query the database ...actually I kinda want a cli search tool that uses the same schema. Brb. Done. AI might be a bubble etc. but I'll still have that search tool (and two dozen other utilities) in 5 years when Claude monthly subsciption is 2000€ and a right to harvest your organs on non-payment. reply",

If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it).

It’s too early to tell how it will work out but things are going better than I expected. It’s probably 20% built after a couple of days, in which I’ve mostly done other work, and it’s working for quite long periods without input from me. When I do have to provide input, the prompt is often just “Continue working according to the project standards and rules”. I have no idea if it’ll meet the requirements. I didn’t expect it to get this far, but a month or two ago I didn’t think the chances were high enough to even make it worth trying. [0] I asked it to create additional documentation for project standards and rules to refer to only when needed (referenced from AGENTS.md).

We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools. I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools. A few very concrete advantages I've found: * I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away. * It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not. Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well: 1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you. 2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea. 3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step. 4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...). 5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.) This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial. reply",

Enabling the feature worked the first time without a hiccup.

I'm not expert enough in JS to, e.g., know the cleanest method to inspect and modify the DOM, but I can look at code that does and tell if the approach it's using is sensible or not. Surely you've had the experience of a domain where you can evaluate the quality of the end product, even if you can't create a high quality product on your own? Concretely in this case, I'd implemented an approach that used jQuery listeners to listen for DOM updates. Antigravity rewrote it to an approach that avoided the jQuery dependency entirely, using native MutationObservers. The code is sensible. It's noticeably more performant than the approach I crafted by hand. Antigravity allowed me to easily add a number of new features to my extension that I would have found tricky to add by hand. The UI looks quite a bit nicer than before I used AI tools to update it. Would these enhancements have been hard for an expert in Chrome extensions to implement? Probably not. But I'm not that expert, and AI coding tools allowed me to do them. That was not actually the main thrust of my post, it's just a nice side benefit I've experienced. In the main domain where I use coding tools, at work, I work in languages where I'm quite a bit more proficient (Golang/Python). There, the quality of code that the AI tools generate is not better than I write by hand. The initial revisions are generally worse. But they're quite a bit faster than I write by hand, and if I iterate with the coding tools I can get to implementations that are as good as I would write by hand, and a lot faster. I understand the bias towards skepticism. I have no particular dog in this fight, it doesn't bother me if you don't use these tools.

If someone who were expert in JS looked at a relatively simple C++ program, I think they could reasonably well tell if the quality of code were good or not. They wouldn't be able to, e.g., detect bugs from default value initialization, memory leaks, etc. But so long as the code didn't do any crazy templating stuff they'd be able to analyze it at a rough \"this algorithm seems sensible\" level\". Analogously I'm quite proficient at C++, and I can easily look at a small JS program and tell if it's sensible. But if you give me even a simple React app I wouldn't be able to understand it without a lot of effort (I've had this experience...) I agree with your broad point: C/C++/Java are certainly much more complex than JS and I would expect someone expert in them to have a much easier time picking up JS than the reverse. But given very high overlap in syntax between the four I think anyone who's proficient in one can grok the basics of the others. reply",

          "text": "The only approach I've tried that seems to work reasonably well, and consistently, was the following: Make a commit. Give Claude a task that's not particularly open ended, the closer to pure \"monkey work\" boilerplate nonsense the task is, the better (which is also the sort of code I don't want do deal with myself). Preferably it should be something that only touches a file or two in the codebase unless it is a trivial refactor (like changing the same method call all over the place) Make sure it is set to planning mode and let it come up with a plan. Review the plan. Let it implement the plan. If it works, great, move on to review. I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another. If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue. If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself. Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works. I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder. This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker. I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source. It's pretty good for that. This idea of having an army of agents all working together on the codebase is hilarious to me. Replace \"agents\" with \"juniors I hired on fiverr with anterograde amnesia\" and it's about how well it goes. reply",

There's some corollary with \"programs are for humans to read and computers to incidentally execute\" here. Ultimately the program has to be a person addressing another person, or nature, and as such it has to evolve within the whole. reply",

I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version. Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files. Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it. It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version. The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well. reply",

Particularly interesting because I didn't expect this to work, let along not to write any code. Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (\"Heart Rate 76bpm\"), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use. Every file is claude generated. AMA. edit: this was particularly interesting as it had to test against the HRM sensor I was wearing during development, and to cope with bluetooth devices appearing and disappearing all the time. It took about a day for the whole thing and cost around $25. further edit: I am by no means an expert with Claude (haven't even got to making a claude.md file); the one real objective here was to get a working example of using dBus to talk to blueZ in C, something I've failed at (more than once) before. reply",

No, that's been established since Karpathy coined the term; you don't review the code, only use the agent and don't care about how it was done, just about the results. The actual interesting stuff is how to use LLMs together with a human, to build high quality code. More \"augmenting the human intellect\" rather than \"autonomous robots building for you\". Overall I'd say if someone handed you a specification that named SSE specifically, you created files with SSE in the name, and the implementation talks about doing SSE, yet it doesn't actually do SSE in the end, it's pretty much on par with code in commercial settings, yeah :) But maybe our bar should be slightly above the ground at least? :) reply",

Bear in mind this was a purely personal project, never intended to see the light of day and initially just done to create a small but operable chunk of dbus/blueZ glue code for another project. I have no doubt that a C developer with sufficient knowledge of dBus, bluetooth, the HRM profile and linux could have written the C code in a day. Adding the HTTP server again would be easy if the developer also had experience of that (n.b. there was a minor compiler error when I tried it on another system due to a slightly different version of libmicrohttpd). Adding the API would be straighforward (but tedious) and similiarly the web page (the web page was an one-shot after Claude wrote the API, vis. \"Create a web page to display a real time plot with history using the API\"). So overall I'd answer that that human developers would could have pulled that off in a day are few and far between (and likely to cost a lot more than $25 plus a day of my time). And do I think the code is good enough? Yes, more than good enough. I could take it and run with it, against that because it ended up 100% AI-generated I feel a bit like leaving it as a monument to \"pure AI\".

The other day I gave an estimate to my co-worker and he said \"but how long is it really going to take, because you always finish a lot quicker than you say, you say two weeks and then it takes two days\". The LLMs will just make me finish things a lot faster and my gut feel estimation for how long things will take still is not yet taking that into account. (And before people talk about typing speed: No that isn't it at all. I've always been the fastest typer and fastest human developer among my close co-workers.) Yes, I need to review the code and interact with the agent. But it's doing a lot better than a lot of developers I've worked with over the years, and if I don't like the style of the code it takes very few words and the LLM will \"get it\" and it will improve it.. Some commenters are comparing the LLM to a junior. In some sense that is right in that the work relationship may be the same as towards a (blazingly fast) junior; but the communication style and knowledge area and how few words I can use to describe something feels more like talking to a senior. (I think it may help that latest 10 years of my career a big part of my job was reviewing other people's code, delegating tasks, being the one who knew the code base best and helping others into it. So that means I'm used to delegating not just coding. Recently I switched jobs and am now coding alone with AI.) reply",

This week I have been making the drawing tools more powerful (not deployed publicly yet). * Gesture recognition to turn wobbly lines into straight lines in some conditions * Auto-fill closed shapes: Vector graphics graph algorithms to segment the graph and compute the right fill regions that feel natural in the UI (default SVG fill regions were not right, took some trial and error to find something that just feels natural enough) * Splines to make smoother curves .. fitting Catmull-Rom, converting those to other splines for SVG representation etc * Constraints when dragging graph nodes around that shapes don't intersect when I don't want them to etc I haven't been working all that much with polygon graphics before, so the LLM is very helpful in a) explaining me the concepts  and b) providing robust implementations for whatever I need. And I've had many dead ends that didn't feel natural in UI that I could discard after trying them out in full, without loosing huge investment. These are all things that are very algorithm and formula intensive and where I would have had do to a lot of reading and research to do things right myself. (I could deal with it, but it takes a lot of time to read up on it.) I review to see that it \"looks sensible\", not every single addition and division in the spline interpolations, or every step of the graph segmentation algorithms used to compute fill regions. I review function signatures and overall architecture, not the small details (in frontend -- obviously the backend authorization code is reviewed line by line..) reply",

          "text": "This is not strictly speech-to-speech, but I quite like it when working with Claude Code or other CLI Agents: STT: Handy [1] (open-source), with Parakeet V3 - stunningly fast, near-instant transcription. The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

I added Spanish support using canary models, as magpie models are English-only and it still works really well. The work is based on a repo by pipecat that I forked and modified to be more comfortable to run (docker compose for the server and client), added Spanish support via canary models, and added Nvidia Ampere support so it can run on my 3090. The use case is a conversation partner for my gf who is learning Spanish, and it works incredibly well.

          "text": "I have a great local assistant that works end-to-end with voice. It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

An API call to GPT4o works quite well (it basically handles both transcription and diarization), but I wanted a local model. Whisper is really good for 1 person speaking. With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content. I'm going to give canary-1b-v2 a try next weekend. But it looks like in spite of enormous development in other areas, speech recognition stalled since Whisper's release (more than 3 years already?). reply",

It spins for a while, then I need to verify in the browser that it actually works and iterate/debug from there. Or I have 3 different approaches I want to try, and I can have the AI just do 1 and see if it works well with the front end and quickly roll back if not.<p>I'd like to be able to work on another agent while it's spinning, otherwise I just sit there and wait.<p>The issue is our env doesn't really allow multiple instances of our app to run simultaneously - our front end is heavy and takes a ton of memory so even if we figure out how to run multiple backends, RAM would be an issue.<p>It seems a lot of multi agent workflows use CLI tools - which makes sense. Anyone find success with web? Maybe some browser automation too?</p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am using a throwaway account because my boss scared the hell out of me.<p>I work for a large AI team (think one of the big ones... Won't say which). And our CEO gave a short but quite clear talk: you HAVE to vibecode. He will check how much we vibe code, how many PRs etc, and will act accordingly.<p>Now. I work in the infra team. What this vibe code mandate means for me is that my work will become unsustainable. I will forecast hordes of PRs impossible to review in time, bloated to the roof. And I can't push them back for the fear of being reported to the CEO. On the other hand, I'll be measured based on the stability of the infra, which will of course collapse.<p>While I see more and more people, even smart people I admire(d), like Karpathy or Antirez, talk wonder about AI coding in a way that looks way, way too similar to how people endorsed Theranos, I face the daily reality that AI coding doesn't work for me. It's wonderful to kickstart a project I don't want to do. But taking home a big architecture refactor or an improvement in the infra... That's not what AI excels at, to say the least.<p>AI is great at throwaway code. AI is great at things you don't know how to do. But for infrastructure... In general, for things that OTHER PEOPLE RELY ON and that NEED TO BE MAINTAINED... it's going to end very badly.<p>But I am losing focus, sorry. What is crazy is that I can't publicly speak about this because I'd get fired. Can you believe it? I am easily the best engineer at the company. Literally EVERYONE thanked me for the contribution to the infrastructure. And still, I am afraid of losing my job because I can't say: AI can't do this.<p>And given the shitton of stocks I have and cannot sell, I must hope that this obvious hype will continue long enough to pay for my mortgage.<p>A new Theranos is in the making.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

This gets around the age restriction, and in fact, has a compounding effect: they are too young to have their OWN devices (so they just install and never use again), burn ad money, and most importantly, skew the target demographic towards users like them- so ad placements end up targeting more of them, because they're most likely to click!<p>This causes all my campaigns to immediately fail, no matter how much I play with the age restriction (again, parent's device). I've changed settings to stop showing in games and on tablets, which has helped a bit, but not fully.<p>Obviously, there is no chance I'm adding real age verification to the app itself.</p></p></div>",
