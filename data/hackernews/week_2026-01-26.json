It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate. I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.) I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

          "text": "Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them. Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

Gmail is (was?) overly aggressive flagging things as spam, so I have the client-side Bayesian filter check Gmail’s spam folder and rescue good email, so long as rspamd also says it’s not phishing. And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus. I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham. If Gmail has been lax at filtering spam lately, I haven’t noticed, but perhaps the Bayesian filter has been picking up the slack. reply",

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.  If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways). reply",

The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

Right now I'm mostly using parakeet v3 on my desktop, but it tends to do a bit more errors, although it is very fast. I cycle betwen it and Distil-Whisper Large V3.5, which is a bit slower. On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content. I'm going to give canary-1b-v2 a try next weekend.

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "It really depends by what you mean by \"it works\". A retrospective of the last 6months. I've had great success coding infra (terraform). It at least 10x the generation of easily verifiable and tedious to write code. Results were audited to death as the client was highly regulated. Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We're nowhere near full agentic coding. However, by reinvesting the speed gains from not writing boilerplate into devex and tests/security, I bring to life much better quality software, maintainable and a boy to work with. I suddenly have the homelab of my dreams, all the ideas previously in the \"too long to execute\" category now get vibe coded while watching TV or doing other stuff. As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want. Most importantly though, and I've heard this from a few other seniors: I've found joy in making cool fun things with tech again. I like that new way of creating stuff at the speed of thought, and I guess for me that counts as \"it works\" reply",

          "text": "Same experience here. On some tasks like build scripts, infra and CI stuff, I am getting a significant speedup. Maybe I am 2x faster on these tasks, when measured from start to PR. I am working on a HPC project[1] that requires more careful architectural thinking. Trying to let the LLM do the whole task most often fail, or produce low quality code (even with top models like Opus 4.5). What works well though is \"assisted\" coding. I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks. It seems to match what I see from the PRs I am reviewing: we are getting these slightly more often than before. --- [1] https://github.com/finos/opengris-scaler reply",

What I'm deeply skeptical of is the ability for agentic to integrate with a team maintaining+shipping a critical offering.

You have to tell it to use async where possible, to do proper error handling and logging, xml comments above complex methods and so on. It works really well once you got it figured out. It also helps to give it separate but focussed tasks, so I have a todo.txt file that it can read to keep track of tasks. Basically you have to be strict with it. I cannot imagine how people trust outputs for python/javascript as there are no strong typing or compilers involved, maybe some linting rules that can save you. Maybe Typescript with strict mode can work but then you have to be a purest about it and watch it like a hawk, which will drain you fast. C# + claude code works really well. reply",

          "text": "Upvote. That's my experience too. Agent coding works really well for existing codebases that are well-structured and organized. If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it). This is where I see clear efficiency gains. reply",

          "text": "I use Augment with Claud Opus 4.5 every day at my job. I barely ever write code by hand anymore. I don't blindly accept the code that it writes, I iterate with it. We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools. I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools. A few very concrete advantages I've found: * I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away. * It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not. Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well: 1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you. 2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea. 3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step. 4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...). 5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.) This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial. reply",

In my experience reading discussions like this, people seem to be saying that they don't believe that Claude Code and similar tools provide much of a productivity boost on relatively open ended domains (i.e. the AI is driving the writing of the code, not just assisting you in writing your own code faster).

I have recently added a step before that when beginning a project with Claude Code: invoke the AskUserQuestionTool and have it ask me questions about what I want to do and what approaches I prefer. It helps to clarify my thinking, and the specs it then produces are much better than if I had written them myself. I should note, though, that I am a pure vibe coder. I don't understand any programming language well enough to identify problems in code by looking at it. When I want to check whether working code produced by Claude might still contain bugs, I have Gemini and Codex check it as well. They always find problems, which I then ask Claude to fix.

I'm not expert enough in JS to, e.g., know the cleanest method to inspect and modify the DOM, but I can look at code that does and tell if the approach it's using is sensible or not. Surely you've had the experience of a domain where you can evaluate the quality of the end product, even if you can't create a high quality product on your own? Concretely in this case, I'd implemented an approach that used jQuery listeners to listen for DOM updates. Antigravity rewrote it to an approach that avoided the jQuery dependency entirely, using native MutationObservers. The code is sensible. It's noticeably more performant than the approach I crafted by hand. Antigravity allowed me to easily add a number of new features to my extension that I would have found tricky to add by hand. The UI looks quite a bit nicer than before I used AI tools to update it. Would these enhancements have been hard for an expert in Chrome extensions to implement? Probably not. But I'm not that expert, and AI coding tools allowed me to do them. That was not actually the main thrust of my post, it's just a nice side benefit I've experienced. In the main domain where I use coding tools, at work, I work in languages where I'm quite a bit more proficient (Golang/Python). There, the quality of code that the AI tools generate is not better than I write by hand. The initial revisions are generally worse. But they're quite a bit faster than I write by hand, and if I iterate with the coding tools I can get to implementations that are as good as I would write by hand, and a lot faster.

If someone who were expert in JS looked at a relatively simple C++ program, I think they could reasonably well tell if the quality of code were good or not. They wouldn't be able to, e.g., detect bugs from default value initialization, memory leaks, etc. But so long as the code didn't do any crazy templating stuff they'd be able to analyze it at a rough \"this algorithm seems sensible\" level\". Analogously I'm quite proficient at C++, and I can easily look at a small JS program and tell if it's sensible. But if you give me even a simple React app I wouldn't be able to understand it without a lot of effort (I've had this experience...) I agree with your broad point: C/C++/Java are certainly much more complex than JS and I would expect someone expert in them to have a much easier time picking up JS than the reverse. But given very high overlap in syntax between the four I think anyone who's proficient in one can grok the basics of the others. reply",

Give Claude a task that's not particularly open ended, the closer to pure \"monkey work\" boilerplate nonsense the task is, the better (which is also the sort of code I don't want do deal with myself). Preferably it should be something that only touches a file or two in the codebase unless it is a trivial refactor (like changing the same method call all over the place) Make sure it is set to planning mode and let it come up with a plan. Review the plan. Let it implement the plan. If it works, great, move on to review. I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another. If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue. If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself. Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works. I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder. This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker. I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source. It's pretty good for that. This idea of having an army of agents all working together on the codebase is hilarious to me.

I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version. Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files. Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it. It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version. The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well. reply",

Particularly interesting because I didn't expect this to work, let along not to write any code. Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (\"Heart Rate 76bpm\"), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use. Every file is claude generated.

It took about a day for the whole thing and cost around $25. further edit: I am by no means an expert with Claude (haven't even got to making a claude.md file); the one real objective here was to get a working example of using dBus to talk to blueZ in C, something I've failed at (more than once) before. reply",

You have to be really valiant and verify everything from top to bottom, if you want to control how things are implemented to that degree, otherwise the agent will still take shortcuts where they can. In https://github.com/lowrescoder/BlueHeart/blob/68ab2387a0c44e... for example, it doesn't actually do SSE at all, instead it queues up a complete HTTP response each time, returns once and then closes the stream, so basically a normal HTTP endpoint, \"labeled\" as a SSE one. SSE is mentioned a bunch of times in the docs, and the files/types/functions are labeled as such, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on internally, from what I could understand.

No, that's been established since Karpathy coined the term; you don't review the code, only use the agent and don't care about how it was done, just about the results. The actual interesting stuff is how to use LLMs together with a human, to build high quality code. More \"augmenting the human intellect\" rather than \"autonomous robots building for you\". Overall I'd say if someone handed you a specification that named SSE specifically, you created files with SSE in the name, and the implementation talks about doing SSE, yet it doesn't actually do SSE in the end, it's pretty much on par with code in commercial settings, yeah :) But maybe our bar should be slightly above the ground at least? :) reply",

Adding the HTTP server again would be easy if the developer also had experience of that (n.b. there was a minor compiler error when I tried it on another system due to a slightly different version of libmicrohttpd). Adding the API would be straighforward (but tedious) and similiarly the web page (the web page was an one-shot after Claude wrote the API, vis. \"Create a web page to display a real time plot with history using the API\").

The other day I gave an estimate to my co-worker and he said \"but how long is it really going to take, because you always finish a lot quicker than you say, you say two weeks and then it takes two days\". The LLMs will just make me finish things a lot faster and my gut feel estimation for how long things will take still is not yet taking that into account. (And before people talk about typing speed: No that isn't it at all. I've always been the fastest typer and fastest human developer among my close co-workers.) Yes, I need to review the code and interact with the agent. But it's doing a lot better than a lot of developers I've worked with over the years, and if I don't like the style of the code it takes very few words and the LLM will \"get it\" and it will improve it.. Some commenters are comparing the LLM to a junior. In some sense that is right in that the work relationship may be the same as towards a (blazingly fast) junior; but the communication style and knowledge area and how few words I can use to describe something feels more like talking to a senior. (I think it may help that latest 10 years of my career a big part of my job was reviewing other people's code, delegating tasks, being the one who knew the code base best and helping others into it. So that means I'm used to delegating not just coding. Recently I switched jobs and am now coding alone with AI.) reply",

Typescript, Svelte, Go, Postgres. This week I have been making the drawing tools more powerful (not deployed publicly yet). * Gesture recognition to turn wobbly lines into straight lines in some conditions * Auto-fill closed shapes: Vector graphics graph algorithms to segment the graph and compute the right fill regions that feel natural in the UI (default SVG fill regions were not right, took some trial and error to find something that just feels natural enough) * Splines to make smoother curves .. fitting Catmull-Rom, converting those to other splines for SVG representation etc * Constraints when dragging graph nodes around that shapes don't intersect when I don't want them to etc I haven't been working all that much with polygon graphics before, so the LLM is very helpful in a) explaining me the concepts  and b) providing robust implementations for whatever I need. And I've had many dead ends that didn't feel natural in UI that I could discard after trying them out in full, without loosing huge investment. These are all things that are very algorithm and formula intensive and where I would have had do to a lot of reading and research to do things right myself. (I could deal with it, but it takes a lot of time to read up on it.) I review to see that it \"looks sensible\", not every single addition and division in the spline interpolations, or every step of the graph segmentation algorithms used to compute fill regions. I review function signatures and overall architecture, not the small details (in frontend -- obviously the backend authorization code is reviewed line by line..) reply",

          "text": "That fear is good, it means you know that you're taking a risk - I'd worry if you had to touch production and didn't feel that fear. If you only have the one or two production systems/databases, and you're having to do this more than a couple of times each year, then you could certainly benefit for improving your tooling. But if you've inherited a large number of production systems, each with their own local database instance. Then implementing new tooling will be a long process that you might not be able to get Management to agree to. When I have to touch a production database, I usually use the following steps: 0. Follow your organisation's Change Processes (i.e. if you need to put in a change request and get approval then do that) 1. Snapshot the server itself (VMs are great for this) 2. Backup the database (just be careful not to leave that backup anywhere open, and remember to clear it up when you no longer need it) 3. Write the SELECT version of your SQL first (If you need to delete a record from the userSessions table with an ID of 123, then start by writing SELECT * FROM userSessions WHERE id=123; 4. If that shows you just the rows you'd expect then convert it to the delete from of the SQL (making sure that you don't change any part of the WHERE clause) DELETE FROM userSessions WHERE id=123; 5. Get someone else, who also understands the database, to check your SQL 6. Run your SQL 7. Do all your sanity checks to make sure that production is working as expected. 8. If it does go wrong then you have more ammunition to use when trying to convince Management to spend some resources on improving your tooling for these sort of changes. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "This doesn't sound like a particularly difficult problem for some scenarios. It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

Further, while you included products that run on the computer, you didn't include the computer itself and key figures like Turing, Von Neumann, This was dependent on the transistor and the folks around Claude Shannon.  And the whole digital life we know today derives from things like the Apollo Program in the 1960s, Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, MIT Instrumentation Lab, etc.  And none of these electronics breakthroughs would have been possible without Quantum Theory and Relativity bringing us Bohr and Einstein and all their successors.  Not to mention James Clerk Maxwell and his equations.  And this is just the technology side of the question.  Get into biology/medicine, etc. and the list explodes further. the double helix discovery (Crick & co), Harvey and blood circulation.  The list is endless.  Move into the government/political realm and the significance of things like the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, and the US Constitution cannot be overstated.

Looked at the code, and wouldn't you know they let the LLM decide... Once started down this path, I knew I was going to need something for isolated exec envs. I ended up building something I think is quite awesome on Dagger. Let's me run in containers without running containers, can get a diff or rewind history, can persist and share wvia any OCI registry. So on one hand, I needed something and chose a technology that would offer me interesting possibilities, and on the other I wanted to have features I don't expect the likes of Microsoft to deliver with Copilot, only one of which is my sandbox setup. I'm not sure I would call it rolling my own completely, I'm building on established technology (OCI, OCR) I don't expect a standard to arise, OCI is already widely adopted and makes sense, but there are other popular techs and there will be a ton of reimplementations by another name/claim. The other half of this is that AI providers are likely to want to run and charge money for this, I personally expect more attempts at vendor lock in in this space. In example, Anthropic bought Bun and I anticipate some product to come of this, isolation and/or canvas related reply",

Today, he argued, the goal of modern management is Utilization (removing every micro-second of downtime).<p>His quote: \"We deleted the 'waiting,' but we forgot that the waiting was the only time the human got to breathe.\"<p>I feel like I see this exact pattern in Software Engineering now.

It's also not new in software. I had a manager tell me I didn't spend enough time typing (he'd never written a line of code after college), even though I'd written quite a bit but not enough code apparently. He liked heroic coders, the sort I usually ended up cleaning up after because they spent too little time thinking and too much time typing, producing products that couldn't be maintained because they had multi-thousand line functions and grotesque for loops containing the bulk of the logic. reply",

          "text": "I’m constantly arguing for more slack in the system. Too many managers treat knowledge work like it’s a factory. I ran a team for about a year and was constantly pushing them to do less. The team were the ones trying to pile on more work, a force of habit I think. I noticed that when we planned less, people finished faster (probably due to greater focus and a quick finish in sight), then they pulled more into the sprint and ended up getting more done. We actually went faster when we tried to do less. I’m hoping that being told to slow down all the time meant it wasn’t actually stressful for them either. I always wanted to have slack in the system so we weren’t having to perform heroics and pull all-nighters to meet arbitrary deadlines. If something came up, we could fit it in, because we weren’t overloading ourselves. And when nothing came up, we flew. I stepped back into an IC role, as I didn’t really enjoy running things. The person who took over was skeptical of how I had done things, but was told to try going with it, since we had been so successful. Overtime there was some regression. After a couple more management changes, we are the polar opposite. Everyone is stressed and it seems like very little actually gets done, because everyone is stretched so thin on too many projects at once. Everyone looks really busy though, I guess that’s all that matters anymore. reply",

Having a whole 2nd engine on a passenger plane seems wasteful, until the first engine fails. When attempting to apply a process optimisation perspective from supply chains or manufacturing to software delivery, one way the software delivery problem space differs is that the software delivery process isn't a process that produces a stream of identical units that are independent of each other. Suppose we abstract the software situation, we can tell ourselves that it is a repeatable process that produces an endless stream of independent features or fixes (weighed in \"story points\" say) that get shipped to production. This mental model maybe works some of the time, until it doesn't. In reality, each software change is often making a bespoke, one-off modification or addition to an existing system. Work to deliver different features or fixes are not fungible and delivering the work items may not be independent -- if changes interfere with each other by touching overlapping components in the existing system and modifying them in incompatible ways.  A more realistic mental model needs to acknowledge that there's a system there, and its existing architecture and accumulated cruft may heavily constrain what can be done, and that the system is often a one-off thing that is getting changed in bespoke ways with each item of work that ships. reply",

          "text": "Yes, and it’s now up to us as managers to engineer that ebb and flow as part of the process. Don’t assign too much work all the time. Make sure that the employees feel excited and rewarded for their hard work (don’t just dump another pile on their desk). Make sure their work is diverse enough so they are not stuck doing the same slog all the time. \nMake sure the employee sees the big picture of the company - this is how your work is contributing to our mission (the janitor at nasa isn’t sweeping the floor, he’s helping put a man on the moon). When boring work must be done tell them you know it’s boring but all of us have to shovel gravel sometimes, it’s just part of life, but there’s a bit of fun on the other side of it. Be interested in the employees - what are their personal goals over the next 12 months? Learn their dogs name, learn their hobbies, be interested in them as a human and then TRY HELP THEM get to their personal goals. If they want to get fit then block out an hour gym time and send them off to it. Encourage them to bring you new ideas, support them to try out the new ideas - if it doesn’t work out then “hey no problem” but if it does work out tell everyone in the company very publicly and make a lot of noise about it. Don’t criticise them in public, take them aside and help them be better. And lastly, is someone isn’t working out, or is causing cultural problems - get rid of them, it’s harming more than you think. Don’t micromanage - assign the work, support them and then get the hell out of the way. Good managers will do all of this simultaneously. Bad managers just try to cram as much work in as possible. Because they are so poor at evaluating the quality of what their employees are doing, the only thing they understand is maximise throughput at the expense of all else.

Follow up in a few days, and send a short (20 seconds max) video attached in case they don’t have time to organise to see the demo.

To the extent you could get an LLM to state such a thing, it would be specious and still not binding. Someone calling the airline support line and assuming the airline agent is authorized to form general contracts doesn't change the legal situation where they are not, right? Fundamentally, running `sdkmanager --licenses` does not consummate a contract [0]. Rather running this command is an indication that the user has been made aware that there is a non-negotiated contract they will be entering into by using the software - it's the continued use of the software which indicates acceptance of the terms. If an LLM does this unbeknownst to a user, this just means there is one less indication that the user is aware of the license. Of course this butts up against the limits to litigation you pointed out, which is why contracts of adhesion mostly revolve around making users disclaim legal rights, and upholding copyright (which can be enforced out of band on the scale it starts to matter). [0] if it did then anyone could trivially work around this by skipping the check with a debugger, independently creating whatever file/contents this command creates, or using software that someone else already installed.

I'm not saying that at all. Agency law is very mature at this stage, and the test to determine that an actor is an agent and whether it acted within the scope of its authority is pretty clear. I'm not going to lay it all out here, so please go study it independently.

The closest analogy we have, I guess, is the power of attorney. If a principal signs off on power of attorney to, e.g. take out a loan/mortgage to buy a thing on principal's behalf, that does not extend to taking any extra liabilities. Any extra liabilities signed off by the agent would be either rendered null or transferred to the agent in any court of law. There is extent to which agency is assigned. The core questions here are agency and liability boundaries. Are there any agency boundaries on the agent? If so, what's the extent? There are many future edge cases where these questions will arise.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hello :-)<p>I have a Discord server I set up a long time ago. Around 2016 I think. Back then, it was lively and active and loads of fun. Over time it's developed close to 5,000 members (it actually had over 5,000 members at one point) and currently has 501 members online as I type this. It's more likely there's about 10-15 that are paying attention to anything happening.<p>It's a Discord that originally focused on DevOps. It complemented my YouTube channel on the same topic, but since then, as it's slowly died out, and my channel's focus as shifted and changed, it's become a bit of a waste land.<p>It's a shame really, because a really fun Discord server can be a great place to be, but I'm not sure where to take it now.<p>How would you handle this situation? What would be your approach to reviving the Discord and perhaps trying to get a community of like minded hackers going again in 2026?<p>I won't link the Discord here as I'm not trying to beg for users or spam. I just genuinely want to work on a solution to improve the life of the server. I will put it in my HN profile, though, so if you do want to check it out that extra step is required.<p>Are people even interested in Discord servers any more? I don't know.<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

You could potentially find ways to better complement the new focus of the channel and see if that brings new excitement to your Discord. (Are there enough channels for your shifted focus? Are you posting your videos to them? Do people have things to say about the new focus?) Most of what keeps a Discord active or not is content and having things to chat about. You list things in an order that suggests the chat started to slowly die and then your channel's focus shifted, but maybe it was the other way around and not as much as of the audience that had found their way through the Discord followed you through the channel refocus as you expected? reply",

          "text": "These days the out-of-the-box automod and autospam prevention tools in Discord are generally good enough you probably don't need third party bots to do it (unless the community gets particularly huge, and even then maybe not). Most bots are now for entertainment more than community management when the Discord is configured right. The biggest trick to getting access to most of those built-in features is that it needs to be marked as a \"Community Server\" [1], so expect to put in the effort to meeting those requirements and getting Discord certified on them. Most of them are good practices in general , especially for something you are trying to present as a public, professional face of your company. Also, I don't think any moderation tools are currently gated behind Server Boosts/Levels, but it may also be worth budgeting for buying a Server Level or two [2]. Most of the reasons to budget for that are marketing and comfort. If you plan to do things like Live Q&A or screensharing events, having the better audio/video capabilities of higher levels can be useful. The custom header for Discord Invites is often a marketing tool to help assuage users seeing the invites that it is indeed the right official community. (Some of the moderation tools were previewed at higher Server Levels, and it does seem like something Discord takes into account when testing various new, desirable features.) (ETA: Also, automoderation only gets you so far in general, you may still want to budget for the labor of real moderators as well, no matter how good you think you can configure the automod tools.)

(One alleged place where it came from was communities migrating from TeamSpeak where \"server\" was the word there, which would make sense as a particular place it came from given the early focus on game players. Another alleged source was some huge non-technical communities that were also early adopters of Discord.) I sort of prefer \"guilds\" for technical reasons, too, and also from enough work on Discord bot development where that terminology is far more common because it is in all the API documentation. But I think a lot of that ship has sailed for non-technical reasons of \"it is just how everyone talks about Discord\". (Also, technically Discord does shard the heaviest \"guilds\" in its server clusters in such a way that the technical resemblance to \"server\" isn't far off if you want to feel better about the non-technical \"server\" terminology.) reply",

It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs.

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

They're a more or less faithful remake of the Commodore 64 but have an HDMI port, SD card instead of disk drive, etc. You could learn BASIC, should be able move to assembly as well—a quick search pulled up a YouTube course on 6502 assembly for the Commodore [2].

My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites.

You could really “see” what the program was doing.<p>At the same time, it’s clearly a product of a different era:<p>– single-process<p>– mostly synchronous code<p>– no real notion of concurrency or async<p>– dated UI and interaction model<p>Today we debug very different systems: multithreaded code, async runtimes, long-running services, distributed components.<p>Yet most debuggers still feel conceptually close to GDB + stepping, just wrapped in a nicer UI.<p>I’m curious how others think about this:<p>– what ideas from DDD (or similar old tools) are still valuable?<p>– what would a “modern DDD” need to handle today’s software?<p>– do you think interactive debugging is still the right abstraction at all?<p>I’m asking mostly from a design perspective — I’ve been experimenting with some debugger ideas myself, but I’m much more interested in hearing how experienced engineers see this problem today.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I always point to the Metal-API debugger in Xcode for what I'd want a CPU debugger to look like, visualizing dependencies and dataflows with an actual graphical UI, letting me view data as something else than just hex dumps (e.g. as image or 3D mesh), etc... etc... Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.)

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm wondering if a shift has occurred. When I started as a junior software engineer, over a decade ago, I learned about unit testing, integration testing, system testing. The whole codebase we worked on was thoroughly unit tested, and had layers of integration tests and system tests as well. I've worked for other employers since and in some cases any kind of automated testing was completely absent. Still, the message I got when reading and keeping up with best practices was: unit test ALL the things!<p>I've personally found that when the architecture of the system is not mature yet, unit tests can get in the way. Terribly so. Integration tests or system tests to assert behavior seem the starting point in this and other scenario's, including when there are no tests at all yet.<p>I've recently read a statement about letting go of a strict \"unit test everything\" mindset and go for integration tests instead. I'm thinking it probably depends, as with everything, on the type of system you're working on, the maturity of the system, the engineers' experience with automated testing, etc.<p>I'd be interested to learn when each type of testing helps you and when it gets in the way (and what it gets in the way of).</p></p></p></div>",

The software under test is always modeling something -- business logic, a communications protocol, a control algorithm, a standard, etc. Behind each of those things is a specification. If a specification doesn't exist then the software is called a prototype. For sustained long term incremental development a specification must exist. The purpose of unit tests is to assert specification-defined invariants at the module interface level. Unit tests are durable iff the specification they uphold is explicit and accessible to developers and the scope of the test is small. It's futile to write good tests for a module which has ambiguous utility. priors: I worked in embedded SW and am now a PhD student. reply",

          "text": "My rule of thumb: unit test logic, integration test plumbing. If a function does actual computation or has branching logic that could go wrong in subtle ways, unit test it. If it's mostly wiring things together (fetch data, transform, save), an integration test catches more real bugs. The \"unit test everything\" era came from a time when spinning up test databases was painful. Now with Docker and in-memory DBs, integration tests are often faster to write AND more useful. Where unit tests still win: algorithmic code, parsing, anything with lots of edge cases. Writing unit tests forces you to think about boundaries. Integration tests just tell you \"it worked this time.\" The worst outcome is having tests that make refactoring painful but don't catch real bugs. I've seen codebases where every internal method signature change breaks 50 unit tests that were essentially testing implementation details. reply",

          "text": "Something I've noticed: most of these techniques work partly because they force you to slow down and actually think about what you're asking. The \"ask for contrasting perspectives\" prompt is annoying specifically because it makes you process more information. The devil's advocate approach forces a second round of evaluation. Even just opening a fresh session adds friction that makes you reconsider the question. When I'm working in domains I know well, I catch the model drifting way faster than in areas where I'm learning. Which suggests the real problem isn't the model - it's that we're outsourcing judgment to it in areas where we shouldn't be. The uncomfortable answer might be: if you're worried the model is reinforcing your biases, you probably don't know the domain well enough to evaluate its answers anyway. reply",

Don't ask it to confirm something; ask it to outline the possibilities and the pros and cons or argument for or against each possibility. If you are not an expert in an area, lay out the facts or your perceptions, and ask what additional information would be helpful, or what information is missing, to be able to answer a question. Then answer those questions, ask if there's now more questions, etc. Once there are no additional questions, then you can ask for the answer. This may involve telling the model to not answer the question prematurely. Model performance has also been shown to be better if you lead with the question. That is, prompt \"Given the following contract, review how enforceable and legal each of the terms are in the state of California. <contract>\", not \"<contract> How enforceable...\". Ask the model for what the experts are saying about the topic. What does the data show? What data supports or refutes a claim? What are the current areas of controversy or gaps in research? Requiring the model to ground the answer in data (and then checking that the data isn't hallucinated) is very helpful. Have the model play the Devil's advocate. If you are a landlord, ask the question from the tenant's perspective. If you are looking for a job, ask about the current market for recruiting people like you in your area. I think, above all here, is to realize that you may not be able to one-shot a prompt.

If I need it to argue from another perspective, I just ask for that perspective in a new session, ideally arguing both sides in temporary sessions so that the context of any other session doesn't affect it. I am also quite good at playing the devil's advocate myself. If you have some expertise, you can just come up with what I consider to be a good counterargument, and ask for an attack or defense of that argument. You can try the prompt below in your favorite thinking model and see what it says. Obviously, this is more work than some other methods. --- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following line of argumentation? Some proponents of climate-change denialism have taken a new tact: pointing out that there is a lack of practical solutions that meaningfully address the change in climate, especially given the political and social systems available. To the extent that climate mitigations are expensive, they will tend to be politically unpopular in democracies, and economically destabilizing in dictatorships. Unilateral adoption of painful solutions weakens a country's relative position among nations; it wouldn't do for, say, China to harm itself economically while the rest of the world enjoys cheap energy. We also have a gerontocracy in most countries; the people in power have no personal stake in the problems 50 years from now, and even as the effects of climate change start to become a problem, those in power are best positioned to be personally insulated. And while there are solutions like solar power that are capital intensive but pay for themselves over time, the sum total of these net positive solutions doesn't amount to a meaningful dent in the problem, nor do we need policies or willpower to support \"no-brainer\" solutions that pay for themselves. The conclusion is that negative effects of climate change are \"baked in\" by the lack of a political system (\"benevolent\" dictatorship) that could force the necessary and painful changes required, hence the entire discussion of climate change, while interesting, is partly moot. Do these people have a point? Is there evidence that we can build an effective solution from non-painful measures? Why would it matter to those in power today, what the global average temperature in 2100 is? reply",

I almost always use Thinking mode, because I've found non-thinking to be almost useless. There are rare exceptions. 'Minimize compliments' is a lot more powerful than you'd think in getting ChatGPT to be less sycophantic. \nThe parts about calculation work okay. It's an improvement over defaults, but you should still verify. \nIt's better at working with text, but still fucks it up a lot.\nThe instructions about handling factual information work very well. It will push back on my or its own claims if they're unsupported. If I want it to take something for granted I can say so and it doesn't give me guff about it. \nI want to adjust the prompt so it pays more attention to the quality of the sources it uses.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Apple introduced App Clips in iOS 14 as a way to instantly use small parts of an app without installing the full application. The idea seemed compelling: low friction, fast launch, contextual entry points (QR, NFC, links).<p>Five years later, I almost never encounter App Clips in the wild and Google killed Instant Apps already.<p>- Are there notable apps or companies where App Clips are a meaningful acquisition or engagement channel?<p>- Did you already decide to remove your App Clip to reduce maintainability?</p></p></p></div>",

It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate. I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.) I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

          "text": "Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them. Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus. I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.  If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways). reply",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We're nowhere near full agentic coding.

As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want.

I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks.

Now I have a Go backend that crawls my NAS every night, indexes files to a FTS5 sqlite database with minimal metadata (size + mimetype + mtime/ctime) and a simple web frontend I can use to query the database ...actually I kinda want a cli search tool that uses the same schema. Brb. Done. AI might be a bubble etc. but I'll still have that search tool (and two dozen other utilities) in 5 years when Claude monthly subsciption is 2000€ and a right to harvest your organs on non-payment. reply",

If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it).

It’s too early to tell how it will work out but things are going better than I expected. It’s probably 20% built after a couple of days, in which I’ve mostly done other work, and it’s working for quite long periods without input from me. When I do have to provide input, the prompt is often just “Continue working according to the project standards and rules”. I have no idea if it’ll meet the requirements. I didn’t expect it to get this far, but a month or two ago I didn’t think the chances were high enough to even make it worth trying. [0] I asked it to create additional documentation for project standards and rules to refer to only when needed (referenced from AGENTS.md).

We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools. I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools. A few very concrete advantages I've found: * I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away. * It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not. Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well: 1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you. 2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea. 3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step. 4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...). 5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.) This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial. reply",

Enabling the feature worked the first time without a hiccup.

I'm not expert enough in JS to, e.g., know the cleanest method to inspect and modify the DOM, but I can look at code that does and tell if the approach it's using is sensible or not. Surely you've had the experience of a domain where you can evaluate the quality of the end product, even if you can't create a high quality product on your own? Concretely in this case, I'd implemented an approach that used jQuery listeners to listen for DOM updates. Antigravity rewrote it to an approach that avoided the jQuery dependency entirely, using native MutationObservers. The code is sensible. It's noticeably more performant than the approach I crafted by hand. Antigravity allowed me to easily add a number of new features to my extension that I would have found tricky to add by hand. The UI looks quite a bit nicer than before I used AI tools to update it. Would these enhancements have been hard for an expert in Chrome extensions to implement? Probably not. But I'm not that expert, and AI coding tools allowed me to do them. That was not actually the main thrust of my post, it's just a nice side benefit I've experienced. In the main domain where I use coding tools, at work, I work in languages where I'm quite a bit more proficient (Golang/Python). There, the quality of code that the AI tools generate is not better than I write by hand. The initial revisions are generally worse. But they're quite a bit faster than I write by hand, and if I iterate with the coding tools I can get to implementations that are as good as I would write by hand, and a lot faster. I understand the bias towards skepticism. I have no particular dog in this fight, it doesn't bother me if you don't use these tools.

If someone who were expert in JS looked at a relatively simple C++ program, I think they could reasonably well tell if the quality of code were good or not. They wouldn't be able to, e.g., detect bugs from default value initialization, memory leaks, etc. But so long as the code didn't do any crazy templating stuff they'd be able to analyze it at a rough \"this algorithm seems sensible\" level\". Analogously I'm quite proficient at C++, and I can easily look at a small JS program and tell if it's sensible. But if you give me even a simple React app I wouldn't be able to understand it without a lot of effort (I've had this experience...) I agree with your broad point: C/C++/Java are certainly much more complex than JS and I would expect someone expert in them to have a much easier time picking up JS than the reverse. But given very high overlap in syntax between the four I think anyone who's proficient in one can grok the basics of the others. reply",

          "text": "The only approach I've tried that seems to work reasonably well, and consistently, was the following: Make a commit. Give Claude a task that's not particularly open ended, the closer to pure \"monkey work\" boilerplate nonsense the task is, the better (which is also the sort of code I don't want do deal with myself). Preferably it should be something that only touches a file or two in the codebase unless it is a trivial refactor (like changing the same method call all over the place) Make sure it is set to planning mode and let it come up with a plan. Review the plan. Let it implement the plan. If it works, great, move on to review. I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another. If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue. If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself. Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works. I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder. This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker. I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source. It's pretty good for that. This idea of having an army of agents all working together on the codebase is hilarious to me. Replace \"agents\" with \"juniors I hired on fiverr with anterograde amnesia\" and it's about how well it goes. reply",

There's some corollary with \"programs are for humans to read and computers to incidentally execute\" here. Ultimately the program has to be a person addressing another person, or nature, and as such it has to evolve within the whole. reply",

I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version. Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files. Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it. It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version. The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well. reply",

Particularly interesting because I didn't expect this to work, let along not to write any code. Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (\"Heart Rate 76bpm\"), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use. Every file is claude generated. AMA. edit: this was particularly interesting as it had to test against the HRM sensor I was wearing during development, and to cope with bluetooth devices appearing and disappearing all the time. It took about a day for the whole thing and cost around $25. further edit: I am by no means an expert with Claude (haven't even got to making a claude.md file); the one real objective here was to get a working example of using dBus to talk to blueZ in C, something I've failed at (more than once) before. reply",

No, that's been established since Karpathy coined the term; you don't review the code, only use the agent and don't care about how it was done, just about the results. The actual interesting stuff is how to use LLMs together with a human, to build high quality code. More \"augmenting the human intellect\" rather than \"autonomous robots building for you\". Overall I'd say if someone handed you a specification that named SSE specifically, you created files with SSE in the name, and the implementation talks about doing SSE, yet it doesn't actually do SSE in the end, it's pretty much on par with code in commercial settings, yeah :) But maybe our bar should be slightly above the ground at least? :) reply",

Bear in mind this was a purely personal project, never intended to see the light of day and initially just done to create a small but operable chunk of dbus/blueZ glue code for another project. I have no doubt that a C developer with sufficient knowledge of dBus, bluetooth, the HRM profile and linux could have written the C code in a day. Adding the HTTP server again would be easy if the developer also had experience of that (n.b. there was a minor compiler error when I tried it on another system due to a slightly different version of libmicrohttpd). Adding the API would be straighforward (but tedious) and similiarly the web page (the web page was an one-shot after Claude wrote the API, vis. \"Create a web page to display a real time plot with history using the API\"). So overall I'd answer that that human developers would could have pulled that off in a day are few and far between (and likely to cost a lot more than $25 plus a day of my time). And do I think the code is good enough? Yes, more than good enough. I could take it and run with it, against that because it ended up 100% AI-generated I feel a bit like leaving it as a monument to \"pure AI\".

The other day I gave an estimate to my co-worker and he said \"but how long is it really going to take, because you always finish a lot quicker than you say, you say two weeks and then it takes two days\". The LLMs will just make me finish things a lot faster and my gut feel estimation for how long things will take still is not yet taking that into account. (And before people talk about typing speed: No that isn't it at all. I've always been the fastest typer and fastest human developer among my close co-workers.) Yes, I need to review the code and interact with the agent. But it's doing a lot better than a lot of developers I've worked with over the years, and if I don't like the style of the code it takes very few words and the LLM will \"get it\" and it will improve it.. Some commenters are comparing the LLM to a junior. In some sense that is right in that the work relationship may be the same as towards a (blazingly fast) junior; but the communication style and knowledge area and how few words I can use to describe something feels more like talking to a senior. (I think it may help that latest 10 years of my career a big part of my job was reviewing other people's code, delegating tasks, being the one who knew the code base best and helping others into it. So that means I'm used to delegating not just coding. Recently I switched jobs and am now coding alone with AI.) reply",

This week I have been making the drawing tools more powerful (not deployed publicly yet). * Gesture recognition to turn wobbly lines into straight lines in some conditions * Auto-fill closed shapes: Vector graphics graph algorithms to segment the graph and compute the right fill regions that feel natural in the UI (default SVG fill regions were not right, took some trial and error to find something that just feels natural enough) * Splines to make smoother curves .. fitting Catmull-Rom, converting those to other splines for SVG representation etc * Constraints when dragging graph nodes around that shapes don't intersect when I don't want them to etc I haven't been working all that much with polygon graphics before, so the LLM is very helpful in a) explaining me the concepts  and b) providing robust implementations for whatever I need. And I've had many dead ends that didn't feel natural in UI that I could discard after trying them out in full, without loosing huge investment. These are all things that are very algorithm and formula intensive and where I would have had do to a lot of reading and research to do things right myself. (I could deal with it, but it takes a lot of time to read up on it.) I review to see that it \"looks sensible\", not every single addition and division in the spline interpolations, or every step of the graph segmentation algorithms used to compute fill regions. I review function signatures and overall architecture, not the small details (in frontend -- obviously the backend authorization code is reviewed line by line..) reply",

          "text": "This is not strictly speech-to-speech, but I quite like it when working with Claude Code or other CLI Agents: STT: Handy [1] (open-source), with Parakeet V3 - stunningly fast, near-instant transcription. The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

I added Spanish support using canary models, as magpie models are English-only and it still works really well. The work is based on a repo by pipecat that I forked and modified to be more comfortable to run (docker compose for the server and client), added Spanish support via canary models, and added Nvidia Ampere support so it can run on my 3090. The use case is a conversation partner for my gf who is learning Spanish, and it works incredibly well.

          "text": "I have a great local assistant that works end-to-end with voice. It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

An API call to GPT4o works quite well (it basically handles both transcription and diarization), but I wanted a local model. Whisper is really good for 1 person speaking. With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content. I'm going to give canary-1b-v2 a try next weekend. But it looks like in spite of enormous development in other areas, speech recognition stalled since Whisper's release (more than 3 years already?). reply",

It spins for a while, then I need to verify in the browser that it actually works and iterate/debug from there. Or I have 3 different approaches I want to try, and I can have the AI just do 1 and see if it works well with the front end and quickly roll back if not.<p>I'd like to be able to work on another agent while it's spinning, otherwise I just sit there and wait.<p>The issue is our env doesn't really allow multiple instances of our app to run simultaneously - our front end is heavy and takes a ton of memory so even if we figure out how to run multiple backends, RAM would be an issue.<p>It seems a lot of multi agent workflows use CLI tools - which makes sense. Anyone find success with web? Maybe some browser automation too?</p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am using a throwaway account because my boss scared the hell out of me.<p>I work for a large AI team (think one of the big ones... Won't say which). And our CEO gave a short but quite clear talk: you HAVE to vibecode. He will check how much we vibe code, how many PRs etc, and will act accordingly.<p>Now. I work in the infra team. What this vibe code mandate means for me is that my work will become unsustainable. I will forecast hordes of PRs impossible to review in time, bloated to the roof. And I can't push them back for the fear of being reported to the CEO. On the other hand, I'll be measured based on the stability of the infra, which will of course collapse.<p>While I see more and more people, even smart people I admire(d), like Karpathy or Antirez, talk wonder about AI coding in a way that looks way, way too similar to how people endorsed Theranos, I face the daily reality that AI coding doesn't work for me. It's wonderful to kickstart a project I don't want to do. But taking home a big architecture refactor or an improvement in the infra... That's not what AI excels at, to say the least.<p>AI is great at throwaway code. AI is great at things you don't know how to do. But for infrastructure... In general, for things that OTHER PEOPLE RELY ON and that NEED TO BE MAINTAINED... it's going to end very badly.<p>But I am losing focus, sorry. What is crazy is that I can't publicly speak about this because I'd get fired. Can you believe it? I am easily the best engineer at the company. Literally EVERYONE thanked me for the contribution to the infrastructure. And still, I am afraid of losing my job because I can't say: AI can't do this.<p>And given the shitton of stocks I have and cannot sell, I must hope that this obvious hype will continue long enough to pay for my mortgage.<p>A new Theranos is in the making.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

This gets around the age restriction, and in fact, has a compounding effect: they are too young to have their OWN devices (so they just install and never use again), burn ad money, and most importantly, skew the target demographic towards users like them- so ad placements end up targeting more of them, because they're most likely to click!<p>This causes all my campaigns to immediately fail, no matter how much I play with the age restriction (again, parent's device). I've changed settings to stop showing in games and on tablets, which has helped a bit, but not fully.<p>Obviously, there is no chance I'm adding real age verification to the app itself.</p></p></div>",

          "text": "My running joke after showing off some amazing LLM-driven work is... if you think this is impressive, I once opened a modal dialog on an Apple IIGS in 65C816 assembly I don't think you need to learn BASIC, if you know concepts like conditionals and looping and indexing.  It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs. As crowds moved along these lines together to a degree as they emerged, it might help to look at publication dates for the books of the time, and use what's found in the earlier texts to help you with later concepts. reply",

If you only have experience programming in modern languages (Javascript, etc.), learning the Applesoft BASIC will also be super helpful before you learn 6502, as you'll learn how to get by without ... A) the following language conveniences: - function names (it's all line numbers), - variables with more than 2 letters, and B) the following modern concepts: - function calls (no stack other than for GOSUB, use subroutines with dedicated variables for passing parameters instead), - scoped variables (everything is global), - dynamic allocation (you have to DIM arrays with the max size upfront), - anything object-like like structs or classes (hack it with multi-dimensional arrays) - other fancy stuff like callbacks, promises, hashtables and any other data structure beyond arrays. and that will nicely prepare you for 6502 assembly (or any kind of assembly really). The advantage in 6502 assembly is you can implement most of B) yourself if you do need it. reply",

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

Since it's included in the computer you can PEEK and POKE memory locations from BASIC and get a feel for how memory and machine code works without needing to understand the whole entire hardware, bootloading process, etc. first. In my opinion BASIC, with its line numbers and GOTO / GOSUB feels assembly-ish anyway - you'll be doing a lot of JMP / JSR to control program flow which is different to how modern high levels are normally written. reply",

My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

          "text": "Starting with Assembly is simply a bad idea because the tooling is terrible, and the learning curve of the tooling is steep. Filled with arcane codes and abbreviations and workflow right out the gate. Programming concepts are pretty much universal. Being distanced from computer architecture is not a limitation for novice programmers, Python et al succeeds for a reason. If you're determined to start with assembly, then I hope you can find someone to help you get started with all the machinations necessary to get from LDA #0 to A9 00 with as little drama as possible. Someone to show you how to use the assembler, what the directives mean, the linker, a symbolic debugger (if you're lucky). Someone to provide you with a .DUMPREG \"START OF SORT\" and .DUMPMEM BUFF $80 \"AFTER INPUT\" macros that you can liberally scatter throughout your code so you actually progress and get some insight into what the heck you code is doing. Perhaps some way to stop your programs that doesn't include hitting the reset button on the machine. I mention that because, again, the tooling is terrible. All of the is easier said than done. None of the assembly books address this, none of the assembly program reference guides do either. Assembly is VERY black box. It's a large step up to even get started. It's much easier to \"learn programming\" first at a higher level, where you can quickly progress and succeed, before turning into the dark hole that is assembly, particularly on older machines. At least on a KIM-1 you can hit the STOP button and cursor through memory (being conscious that the memory architecture of the KIM is quite funky), something that simple is quite difficult on an Apple ][. reply",

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites. The lack of immediacy helps keep the emotional reaction in check (it's not as addictive of course). reply",

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I love technology. But I'm no longer optimistic about the future. It seems like AI is not going to go away, and instead of building reliable software, managers seem to push people to use AI more, as long as they ship products. Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Why pay artists for music, when you can just generate endless amount of AI music?<p>And even things like \"doing day to day chores\" are being automated away with tools like AI assistants. The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh*t throughout the day. How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI.<p>So my question HN: What's the point anymore? Why keep going and where to?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "Maybe a rough analogy: why take a train when you can fly? Flying is faster and often cheaper. If efficiency were the only axis, trains should’ve died long ago. They didn’t. They became alternative infrastructure, used when people care about cost predictability, comfort, scenery, control, or just preference. AI will do the same thing. Summaries won’t replace books, generated music won’t replace artists, and assistants won’t replace doing things yourself. They’ll replace the lowest friction default. Everything else shifts from “mass” to “intentional” That doesn’t mean fewer humans have value, but instead it means value becomes less generic. The question isn’t “what’s the point anymore” , it’s “what survives when optimization stops being the only goal?\" reply",

It's the same with coding: I no longer see point to write OSS by hand, as every day, 10 projects appear on HN front page, that are 95.9% AI generated. Becoming a successful writer / musician, is already hard. With software, it was easier, but in my opinion, it will become hard as well. There will be individuals in the software development who are like Taylor Swift, because they know how LLMs work, and how to optimize them to squeeze one more KPI. The rest will just be nobodies. And sure, if you think you are an extraordinary person, or you were born in the right environment, then you probably don't have to worry. But I'm an average Joe, who wants to live an average Joe's life, but it's being taken away from me. And while the select few might have access to a live Taylor Swift performance, or a personal reading of the latest novel by a struggling author, the rest of us are going to be fed AI slop. reply",

And while sure, merit / good taste are important, but if you look at the mainstream it's filled with average. Now, from the consumer side you can claim \"what do you care about the mainstream, just look for good taste, and you will find it\", and I agree with you. But I do not speak about the consumer side, but rather the producer side. As a producer, I want to produce \"good taste\", but if there is very little demand for good taste things, I might struggle to sustain myself while producing based on merit. In the end, the reason enshittification exists, is because \"good taste\" stuff became too popular and the authors decided to capitalize on it (can't blame them when you have a mortgage to pay, and family to feed), and turn it into \"mainstream crap\". I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that creating good taste is not easy. And it will become even harder as the mainstream will expand and capture AI generated content, leaving people who believe in creation based on merit, fighting for the crumbs. reply",

Digital and electric technologies aren't healthy things to be around. Do you want to live in the range of a 10G antenna or near a massive solar array?

How do you know the robots won't come and just kill us all when they can because we have no power/influence/value? Where will people migrate to in order to avoid that? Antarctica? The moon? Underground to avoid weaponized satellites? Conscience and consciousness really needs to grow with technology, really that's the challenge of today. Always has been.

It was pleasant, and I could feel that every hit really meant something to shape the future of the stone, and thereby the building. Customers and contractors alike told me how great it was to see me work that stone. So I kept swinging that hammer. Then I was told about some electrical chisel that was supposed to make my life better. Sure, I made more money, but the work was gone. It just shakes; it doesn't vibrate. I get numb, not proud. I have to take breaks, because my hands can't handle it. It's awful. What's the point, I asked? But then I started talking to my colleagues during those breaks. I even discovered I had a relative in common with one. While chipping away at stone, no one ever wanted to stand close to me, and I had spent all this time proudly creating stone chips all day long! I still chip away at stone sometimes, but only when there's no one else around to talk to at breaktime. --- You are not going to be able to stop change. The world never stood still, it's just that changes happen step-wise, and it's unlikely any one step affects _you_ profoundly. This time, the step affects you (and me.)

I don't make effort to stop them being made though (using porn mode, adding “fuck”/“fucking” to search terms, etc.) - hopefully making them waste resources on generating things that are never used will et noticed and they'll ramp that down a bit at least for accounts like mine. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Before AI, did you just skip to the last few pages to see what happened? If not, then just keep reading like you did before. Avoiding the slop books that are flooding the market ATM might be more of a concern, but there was plenty written before the LLM bubble started to keep you in things to read for a lifetime. > The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh t throughout the day.* Other hobbies. I like trail running (or if in a slower mood, country walking), AI isn't going to stop me doing that. HEMA and other activities with friends too. > How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI. That is a completely different question to the rest where you are asking about things that you would do for enjoyment, and is a bigger societal and philosophical concern than I have time to chew on right now… > What's the point anymore? Same as it was before: do what you need to do to survive, then do what you need to do to enjoy any remaining time after that. Perhaps I'm helped here by being back on the up after a couple of years recovering from proper burnout: I know the way things are going won't make me feel worse than that, and I survived that. Current politics and other social issues away from tech on the other hand… > Why keep going? When all hope feels truly lost, at least keep going out of spite. > Why keep going and where to?

LLMs do not guarantee either of those, so unless they improve to the point where they do, this really doesn't change the overall market, it just changes the level of resources required to play.

It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate.

I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.

The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

Only supports Whisper and Parakeet V3 but nice app & those are amazing models. https://github.com/cjpais/Handy reply",

It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm wondering if a shift has occurred. When I started as a junior software engineer, over a decade ago, I learned about unit testing, integration testing, system testing. The whole codebase we worked on was thoroughly unit tested, and had layers of integration tests and system tests as well. I've worked for other employers since and in some cases any kind of automated testing was completely absent. Still, the message I got when reading and keeping up with best practices was: unit test ALL the things!<p>I've personally found that when the architecture of the system is not mature yet, unit tests can get in the way. Terribly so. Integration tests or system tests to assert behavior seem the starting point in this and other scenario's, including when there are no tests at all yet.<p>I've recently read a statement about letting go of a strict \"unit test everything\" mindset and go for integration tests instead. I'm thinking it probably depends, as with everything, on the type of system you're working on, the maturity of the system, the engineers' experience with automated testing, etc.<p>I'd be interested to learn when each type of testing helps you and when it gets in the way (and what it gets in the way of).</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "My rule of thumb: unit test logic, integration test plumbing. If a function does actual computation or has branching logic that could go wrong in subtle ways, unit test it. If it's mostly wiring things together (fetch data, transform, save), an integration test catches more real bugs. The \"unit test everything\" era came from a time when spinning up test databases was painful. Now with Docker and in-memory DBs, integration tests are often faster to write AND more useful. Where unit tests still win: algorithmic code, parsing, anything with lots of edge cases. Writing unit tests forces you to think about boundaries. Integration tests just tell you \"it worked this time.\" The worst outcome is having tests that make refactoring painful but don't catch real bugs. I've seen codebases where every internal method signature change breaks 50 unit tests that were essentially testing implementation details. reply",

Benefits: * Finds bugs * Can be a handy local dev loop and local debugging loop * Documents code and proves that documentation is correct * Helps with AI assistance * Integration tests should make refactoring easier or more confident.

The \"ask for contrasting perspectives\" prompt is annoying specifically because it makes you process more information. The devil's advocate approach forces a second round of evaluation. Even just opening a fresh session adds friction that makes you reconsider the question. When I'm working in domains I know well, I catch the model drifting way faster than in areas where I'm learning. Which suggests the real problem isn't the model - it's that we're outsourcing judgment to it in areas where we shouldn't be. The uncomfortable answer might be: if you're worried the model is reinforcing your biases, you probably don't know the domain well enough to evaluate its answers anyway. reply",

Then answer those questions, ask if there's now more questions, etc. Once there are no additional questions, then you can ask for the answer. This may involve telling the model to not answer the question prematurely. Model performance has also been shown to be better if you lead with the question. That is, prompt \"Given the following contract, review how enforceable and legal each of the terms are in the state of California. <contract>\", not \"<contract> How enforceable...\". Ask the model for what the experts are saying about the topic. What does the data show? What data supports or refutes a claim? What are the current areas of controversy or gaps in research? Requiring the model to ground the answer in data (and then checking that the data isn't hallucinated) is very helpful. Have the model play the Devil's advocate. If you are a landlord, ask the question from the tenant's perspective. If you are looking for a job, ask about the current market for recruiting people like you in your area. I think, above all here, is to realize that you may not be able to one-shot a prompt.

If I need it to argue from another perspective, I just ask for that perspective in a new session, ideally arguing both sides in temporary sessions so that the context of any other session doesn't affect it. I am also quite good at playing the devil's advocate myself. If you have some expertise, you can just come up with what I consider to be a good counterargument, and ask for an attack or defense of that argument. You can try the prompt below in your favorite thinking model and see what it says. Obviously, this is more work than some other methods. --- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following line of argumentation? Some proponents of climate-change denialism have taken a new tact: pointing out that there is a lack of practical solutions that meaningfully address the change in climate, especially given the political and social systems available. To the extent that climate mitigations are expensive, they will tend to be politically unpopular in democracies, and economically destabilizing in dictatorships. Unilateral adoption of painful solutions weakens a country's relative position among nations; it wouldn't do for, say, China to harm itself economically while the rest of the world enjoys cheap energy. We also have a gerontocracy in most countries; the people in power have no personal stake in the problems 50 years from now, and even as the effects of climate change start to become a problem, those in power are best positioned to be personally insulated. And while there are solutions like solar power that are capital intensive but pay for themselves over time, the sum total of these net positive solutions doesn't amount to a meaningful dent in the problem, nor do we need policies or willpower to support \"no-brainer\" solutions that pay for themselves. The conclusion is that negative effects of climate change are \"baked in\" by the lack of a political system (\"benevolent\" dictatorship) that could force the necessary and painful changes required, hence the entire discussion of climate change, while interesting, is partly moot. Do these people have a point? Is there evidence that we can build an effective solution from non-painful measures? Why would it matter to those in power today, what the global average temperature in 2100 is? reply",

'Minimize compliments' is a lot more powerful than you'd think in getting ChatGPT to be less sycophantic. \nThe parts about calculation work okay.

The problem with this is that I miss important things and they often get buried.<p>I've spent hours and hours unsubscribing, deleting, uninstalling, toggling settings, but then I find myself reinstalling, resubscribing. It's just a mess, and exhausting to just think about.<p>The reason I'm writing this is partially to vent. I just realized that my closest friend's birthday was a few weeks ago. I had it in my calendar, but never saw the notification. Yes, I should be more organized and Yes, it's not the end of the world. but damnit, i get so much crap from this bionic appendage, and still I cant use this tool to help me with remembering important things.<p>It just seems like its getting worse every year.<p>Hopefully this is helpful to others.<p>P.S. can we please stop with the \"would you like all or some cookies\" popup on every friggin website?<p>P.P.S. can websites stop asking for permission to invade my OS?<p>P.P.P.S. does anyone else ever want to run away and be an off-grid hermit?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'll suggest an approach that works for me. Ask yourself what it is you're actually doing / attending to / accomplishing, with regard to whatever notification you happen to see. Then identify similar ones; group them together; and work on that group at repeated intervals. It should feel like boring maintenance work — because the goal is to make work predictable in order to predictably achieve the outcomes you desire (and then to automate the work, if you want, to free up your time). This also helps to identify low-value types of activities and then deprioritize or eliminate them. By way of your example, I want to take certain actions regarding special days involving people who are important to me (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries …). So periodically I attend to that because it's important. (Maybe that means I plan things out every week, or every month — up to you. And then the planned tasks — calling my buddy, shopping for gifts, writing and mailing cards — go on the calendar as planned work.) It's during that work period that I see triggers / upcoming items related to that group of items. Why would I want notifications or other interruptions about them any other time? Answer: only for things that are true emergencies. Maybe you should have a yearly repeating 15-minute calendar entry to call your friend on their birthday. (You are working from your calendar, right?) The other tip I can offer is to do yesterday's incoming work today, and today's incoming work tomorrow. This lets you strategically plan how you will handle all of today's work instead of getting interrupted by it today and bouncing around trying to deal with it. Moreover, very few things need to be done immediately; many problems solve themselves with time; and sleeping on things can shift a large chunk of the time-consuming processing involved with it to your subconscious mind. (Furthermore, the habit of planning your work in advance and addressing it methodically is going to drastically reduce the number of true emergencies and even typical interruptions that you'll feel the need to deal with. It's a virtuous cycle.) I'll leave you with the notions that practically everything is unimportant when you consider its place in the incalculable vastness of the universe; you never get your time back; and your health is of paramount importance. P.S.: I somehow missed that you had the birthday on your calendar. This tells me that either you're not working from your calendar (big problem) or else you added the birthday as an all-day event instead of an appointment (\"I will call my friend on their birthday every year at 12 PM and catch up for 15 minutes\"). reply",

From what I’ve heard, at this scale only a few tools (like Claude’s desktop app) are genuinely helpful, so I haven’t experimented much with other AI coding services.<p>At the same time, I keep seeing posts about people building 20k lines of code and launching a SaaS in a single 40-hour weekend. That’s made me question whether I’m being overly cautious, or just operating under outdated assumptions.<p>I already rely on AI quite a bit, and one clear benefit is that I now understand parts of the codebase that I previously wrote without fully grasping. Still, at my current pace, it feels like I’ll need several more months of development, followed by several more months of testing, before this can become a real production service. And that testing doesn’t feel optional.<p>Meanwhile, products that are described as being “vibe coded” don’t seem to be getting particularly negative evaluations.<p>So I’m wondering how people here think about this now.\nIs “you don’t really understand the code, so it’ll hurt you later” still a meaningful criticism?\nOr are we reaching a point where the default approach to building software itself needs to change?<p>I’d especially appreciate perspectives from people working on larger or more complex systems.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "> Is “you don’t really understand the code, so it’ll hurt you later” still a meaningful criticism? That is one of the strongest valid criticisms. Even if we ignore the possibility that the code that is vibed will be buggy and insecure, the real long-term problem is not having someone who understands the system. Almost every well maintained app has one or more people who grok the whole thing, who can hear a problem described and know right where the fix will be. They'll have a mental model of the whole system and can advise on architecture changes and other refactors. They can help teach the codebase to new folks. And most importantly, when an outage happens, they are the ones who quickly get you back up and running. The lack of those people is why legacy systems are brittle and hard to maintain, so vibe coding a complex app puts you directly into that painful legacy maintenance mode. One thought people are starting to throw out there is, \"But the AI can just re-write the whole app every time we have a bug, so we never need to know things to that level.\" But those people have never worked with a customer base who gets ticked off when the same bugs re-appear on every release, or when a dozen small UI changes shows up on every release. Vibe coding might give you some working code. But working code is an astoundingly low bar to set for actually building a product that pleases a customer base. reply",

          "text": "I've been using AI assistance on a ~30k LOC production codebase. My take: the \"vibe coding\" framing is misleading because it implies two modes - understand everything or understand nothing. What actually happens is tiered understanding. I might vibe-code a utility function (don't care about implementation, just that it works), but I need to deeply understand data flow and business logic boundaries. The 20k LOC weekend SaaS stories are real but missing context. Either the person has deep domain knowledge (knows WHAT to build, AI helps with HOW), or it's mostly boilerplate with thin business logic. For complex systems, the testing point is key. AI generates code faster than you can verify behaviour. The bottleneck shifts from \"writing code\" to \"specifying behaviour precisely enough that you know when it's right\". That part isn't going away. The people I see struggling aren't the ones who don't understand their code - it's the ones who don't understand their requirements. reply",

How many people do you think are out there vibe coding things? Aren't companies built on execution? Or do we now build companies on tech stacks alone? Before LLMS, how could a solo dev get a moat? Any company could hire a team to replicate your product. They might not care how much it costs them. \"Hours spent coding\" isn't the moat. reply",

          "text": "My running joke after showing off some amazing LLM-driven work is... if you think this is impressive, I once opened a modal dialog on an Apple IIGS in 65C816 assembly I don't think you need to learn BASIC, if you know concepts like conditionals and looping and indexing.  It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs. As crowds moved along these lines together to a degree as they emerged, it might help to look at publication dates for the books of the time, and use what's found in the earlier texts to help you with later concepts. reply",

They're a more or less faithful remake of the Commodore 64 but have an HDMI port, SD card instead of disk drive, etc. You could learn BASIC, should be able move to assembly as well—a quick search pulled up a YouTube course on 6502 assembly for the Commodore [2].

          "text": "> And is it absolutely necessary to learn BASIC before Assembly If you don't have experience programming, learning BASIC before Assembly will be super helpful before you learn 6502. If you only have experience programming in modern languages (Javascript, etc.), learning the Applesoft BASIC will also be super helpful before you learn 6502, as you'll learn how to get by without ... A) the following language conveniences: - function names (it's all line numbers), - variables with more than 2 letters, and B) the following modern concepts: - function calls (no stack other than for GOSUB, use subroutines with dedicated variables for passing parameters instead), - scoped variables (everything is global), - dynamic allocation (you have to DIM arrays with the max size upfront), - anything object-like like structs or classes (hack it with multi-dimensional arrays) - other fancy stuff like callbacks, promises, hashtables and any other data structure beyond arrays. and that will nicely prepare you for 6502 assembly (or any kind of assembly really). The advantage in 6502 assembly is you can implement most of B) yourself if you do need it. reply",

From there, start writing 6502 in an emulator and seeing what happens. That's where you're going to learn, and the feedback will be a lot faster.

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

          "text": "Starting with Assembly is simply a bad idea because the tooling is terrible, and the learning curve of the tooling is steep. Filled with arcane codes and abbreviations and workflow right out the gate. Programming concepts are pretty much universal. Being distanced from computer architecture is not a limitation for novice programmers, Python et al succeeds for a reason. If you're determined to start with assembly, then I hope you can find someone to help you get started with all the machinations necessary to get from LDA #0 to A9 00 with as little drama as possible. Someone to show you how to use the assembler, what the directives mean, the linker, a symbolic debugger (if you're lucky). Someone to provide you with a .DUMPREG \"START OF SORT\" and .DUMPMEM BUFF $80 \"AFTER INPUT\" macros that you can liberally scatter throughout your code so you actually progress and get some insight into what the heck you code is doing. Perhaps some way to stop your programs that doesn't include hitting the reset button on the machine. I mention that because, again, the tooling is terrible. All of the is easier said than done. None of the assembly books address this, none of the assembly program reference guides do either. Assembly is VERY black box. It's a large step up to even get started. It's much easier to \"learn programming\" first at a higher level, where you can quickly progress and succeed, before turning into the dark hole that is assembly, particularly on older machines. At least on a KIM-1 you can hit the STOP button and cursor through memory (being conscious that the memory architecture of the KIM is quite funky), something that simple is quite difficult on an Apple ][. reply",

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites. The lack of immediacy helps keep the emotional reaction in check (it's not as addictive of course). reply",

You could really “see” what the program was doing.<p>At the same time, it’s clearly a product of a different era:<p>– single-process<p>– mostly synchronous code<p>– no real notion of concurrency or async<p>– dated UI and interaction model<p>Today we debug very different systems: multithreaded code, async runtimes, long-running services, distributed components.<p>Yet most debuggers still feel conceptually close to GDB + stepping, just wrapped in a nicer UI.<p>I’m curious how others think about this:<p>– what ideas from DDD (or similar old tools) are still valuable?<p>– what would a “modern DDD” need to handle today’s software?<p>– do you think interactive debugging is still the right abstraction at all?<p>I’m asking mostly from a design perspective — I’ve been experimenting with some debugger ideas myself, but I’m much more interested in hearing how experienced engineers see this problem today.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

Particularly in distributed systems, the hardest bugs aren't reproducible at all and there are multiple levels of difficulty below that before you get to ones that can be reliably reproduced under a live debugger, which are usually relatively easy. Not being able to use your most powerful tools on your hardest problems rather reduces their value. (Time travel debuggers do record/replay, which expands the set of problems you can use them on, but you still need to get the behaviour to happen while it's being recorded.) reply",

It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

It seems like AI is not going to go away, and instead of building reliable software, managers seem to push people to use AI more, as long as they ship products. Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Why pay artists for music, when you can just generate endless amount of AI music?<p>And even things like \"doing day to day chores\" are being automated away with tools like AI assistants. The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh*t throughout the day. How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI.<p>So my question HN: What's the point anymore? Why keep going and where to?</p></p></div>",

Becoming a successful writer / musician, is already hard. With software, it was easier, but in my opinion, it will become hard as well. There will be individuals in the software development who are like Taylor Swift, because they know how LLMs work, and how to optimize them to squeeze one more KPI. The rest will just be nobodies. And sure, if you think you are an extraordinary person, or you were born in the right environment, then you probably don't have to worry. But I'm an average Joe, who wants to live an average Joe's life, but it's being taken away from me.

And while sure, merit / good taste are important, but if you look at the mainstream it's filled with average. Now, from the consumer side you can claim \"what do you care about the mainstream, just look for good taste, and you will find it\", and I agree with you. But I do not speak about the consumer side, but rather the producer side. As a producer, I want to produce \"good taste\", but if there is very little demand for good taste things, I might struggle to sustain myself while producing based on merit. In the end, the reason enshittification exists, is because \"good taste\" stuff became too popular and the authors decided to capitalize on it (can't blame them when you have a mortgage to pay, and family to feed), and turn it into \"mainstream crap\". I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that creating good taste is not easy. And it will become even harder as the mainstream will expand and capture AI generated content, leaving people who believe in creation based on merit, fighting for the crumbs. reply",

So, either work to create that 1% of interesting content, or filter/curate to find it. I will note that there is a _lot_ of interesting old work which has dropped off the radar --- Hermann Hesse's _Magister Ludi_/_The Glass Bead Game_ was a book which greatly inspired me in my youth (arguably, it's why I use programming tools such as: https://github.com/derkork/openscad-graph-editor ) --- read it? reply",

Summaries won’t replace books, generated music won’t replace artists, and assistants won’t replace doing things yourself. They’ll replace the lowest friction default.

How do you know the robots won't come and just kill us all when they can because we have no power/influence/value? Where will people migrate to in order to avoid that? Antarctica? The moon? Underground to avoid weaponized satellites? Conscience and consciousness really needs to grow with technology, really that's the challenge of today. Always has been.

It was pleasant, and I could feel that every hit really meant something to shape the future of the stone, and thereby the building. Customers and contractors alike told me how great it was to see me work that stone. So I kept swinging that hammer. Then I was told about some electrical chisel that was supposed to make my life better. Sure, I made more money, but the work was gone. It just shakes; it doesn't vibrate. I get numb, not proud. I have to take breaks, because my hands can't handle it. It's awful. What's the point, I asked? But then I started talking to my colleagues during those breaks. I even discovered I had a relative in common with one. While chipping away at stone, no one ever wanted to stand close to me, and I had spent all this time proudly creating stone chips all day long! I still chip away at stone sometimes, but only when there's no one else around to talk to at breaktime. --- You are not going to be able to stop change.

I'm barely touching current \"AI\" other than certain bits of code completion that are on by default in VS and are the right mix of occasionally useful (saving a few tens of keystrokes) and easy to ignore when not. When it gets to the point where I can't compete without using LLMs heavily, I'll have to do something else. Perhaps wait tables somewhere with Spanish customers as I'm trying to learn the language, it won't be much or a pay cut because by the point where someone of my years can't compete at all, almost anyone will be able to do a shite job with LLMs so programming will be heading towards being a minimum-wage job anyway. > Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Yours doesn't have to be. I started writing bits to go online again after many years not bothering. It isn't intended for public consumption, I'm deliberately doing nothing that would be called SEO in fact I'm going anti-SE in some ways, though it isn't hidden should I chose to pass a link to someone or if they decide to pass it on further. It is intended for me and a select few, if someone else finds it somehow and likes it then good the them, and much of the point of making it is the joy of making something. Everyone else using LLMs isn't going to take that from me. > Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Because the summary may be wrong, or technically correct but with entirely the wrong tone or missing key details a summary should have. Or because you want to read the post - you don't have to use the summary. I don't read the summary generated as part of most searches these days, reading them is optional. I don't make effort to stop them being made though (using porn mode, adding “fuck”/“fucking” to search terms, etc.) - hopefully making them waste resources on generating things that are never used will et noticed and they'll ramp that down a bit at least for accounts like mine. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Before AI, did you just skip to the last few pages to see what happened? If not, then just keep reading like you did before. Avoiding the slop books that are flooding the market ATM might be more of a concern, but there was plenty written before the LLM bubble started to keep you in things to read for a lifetime. > The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh t throughout the day.* Other hobbies. I like trail running (or if in a slower mood, country walking), AI isn't going to stop me doing that. HEMA and other activities with friends too. > How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI. That is a completely different question to the rest where you are asking about things that you would do for enjoyment, and is a bigger societal and philosophical concern than I have time to chew on right now… > What's the point anymore? Same as it was before: do what you need to do to survive, then do what you need to do to enjoy any remaining time after that. Perhaps I'm helped here by being back on the up after a couple of years recovering from proper burnout: I know the way things are going won't make me feel worse than that, and I survived that. Current politics and other social issues away from tech on the other hand… > Why keep going? When all hope feels truly lost, at least keep going out of spite. > Why keep going and where to?

It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses. In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android \"user\". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook. You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID. Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information. Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an \"alt account\" for misbehavior is not safe. If my \"alt account\" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked. But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple \"profiles\" and \"pages\" that have unique settings and personalities. reply",

          "text": "Apparently my account \"violated TOS\" (though I don't see how). The other account was used to interact with a Google Workspace in 2016, and hasn't been used since. I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here. This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much. Anyway, here's how it went down: In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my \"personal\" Google account I make this one-off account. This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not \"@gmail.com\"). That may be a factor. Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active. On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old \"role\" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a \"Forgot password\" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they \"know\" I'm the same operator of both accounts. I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being \"wrong\", though. I completed the \"Forgot password\" workflow on the \"role\" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my \"real\" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine. On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows: > From: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com> > To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com > Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled > It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot. > If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible. > Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account. > If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you. reply",

I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example. This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate. I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.) I don't need to give out email addresses for the \"role accounts\" except where I \"Sign In With Google\" to various services.

          "text": "Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them. Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts. But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us. I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used \"MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com\" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address. Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that \"+Echovita\" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach. So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my \"alt accounts\" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam. reply",

Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important).  However I have a lot of non-spam \"promotion\" emails that I don't want to see.  If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways). reply",

          "text": "This is not strictly speech-to-speech, but I quite like it when working with Claude Code or other CLI Agents: STT: Handy [1] (open-source), with Parakeet V3 - stunningly fast, near-instant transcription. The slight accuracy drop relative to bigger models is immaterial when you're talking to an AI. I always ask it to restate back to me what it understood, and it gives back a nicely structured version -- this helps confirm understanding as well as likely helps the CLI agent stay on track. TTS: Pocket-TTS [2], just 100M params, and amazing speech quality (English only).\nI made a voice plugin [3] based on this, for Claude Code so it can speak out short updates whenever CC stops. It uses a non-blocking stop hook that calls a headless agent to create the 1/2-sentence summary. Turns out to be surprisingly useful. It's also fun as you can customize the speaking style and mirror your vibe etc. The voice plugin gives commands to control it: /voice:speak stop\n    /voice:speak azelma (change the voice)\n    /voice:speak <your arbitrary prompt to control the style or other aspects> [1] Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy [2] Pocket-TTS https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts [3] Voice plugin for Claude Code: https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... reply",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! I'm going to put this on my list to play around with. I'm not really an expert in this tech, I come from the audio background, but recently was playing around with streaming Speech-to-Text (using Whisper) / Text-to-Speech (using Kokoro at the time) on a local machine. The most challenging part in my build was tuning the inference batch sizing here.  I was able to get it working well for Speech-to-Text down to batch sizes of 200ms.  I even implement a basic local agreement algorithm and it was still very fast (inferencing time, I think, was around 10-20ms?).  You're basically limited by the minimum batch size, NOT inference time.  Maybe that's a missing \"secret sauce\" suggested in the original post? In the use case listed above, the TTS probably isn't a bottleneck as long as OP can generate tokens quickly. All this being said a wrapped model like this that is able to handle hand-offs between these parts of the process sounds really useful and I'll definitely be interested in seeing how it performs. Let me know if you guys play with this and find success. reply",

On iOS I'm also using the same app, with the Apple Speech model, which I found out to be better performing for me than the parakeet/whisper. One drawback for the apple model is that you need iOS/Mac 26+ - and I haven't bothered to update to Tahoe on my mac. Both of the models work instantly for me (Mac M1, iphone 17 Pro).

It's built on local, web-first technologies, it fits small LLMs in memory and manages inference and TTS/STT without stuttering. I've been shaping it up over a couple years and constantly switching out new models. If you want something simple that runs in browser, look at vosk-browser[0] and vits-web[1]. I'd also recommend checking out KittenTTS[2], I use it and it's great for the size/performance. However, you'd need to implement a custom JavaScript harness for the model since it's a python project. If you need help with that, shoot me an email and I can share some code. There are other great approaches too if you don't mind python, personally I chose the web as a platform in order to make my agent fully portable and remote once I release it. And of course, NVIDIA's new model just came out last week[3] but I haven't gotten to test it out just yet, and also there was the recent Sparrow-1[4] announcement which shows people are finally putting money into the problems plaguing voice agents that are rigged up from several models and glue infrastructure, vs a single end-to-end model or at least a conversational turn-taking model to keep things on rails.

With more people you get repetitions. Qwen and other open multimodal models gives subpar results. I tried multipass approach, with the first one identifying the language and chunking and the next one the actual transcription, but this tended to miss a lot of content. I'm going to give canary-1b-v2 a try next weekend.

The problem with this is that I miss important things and they often get buried.<p>I've spent hours and hours unsubscribing, deleting, uninstalling, toggling settings, but then I find myself reinstalling, resubscribing. It's just a mess, and exhausting to just think about.<p>The reason I'm writing this is partially to vent. I just realized that my closest friend's birthday was a few weeks ago. I had it in my calendar, but never saw the notification. Yes, I should be more organized and Yes, it's not the end of the world. but damnit, i get so much crap from this bionic appendage, and still I cant use this tool to help me with remembering important things.<p>It just seems like its getting worse every year.<p>Hopefully this is helpful to others.<p>P.S. can we please stop with the \"would you like all or some cookies\" popup on every friggin website?<p>P.P.S. can websites stop asking for permission to invade my OS?<p>P.P.P.S. does anyone else ever want to run away and be an off-grid hermit?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'll suggest an approach that works for me. Ask yourself what it is you're actually doing / attending to / accomplishing, with regard to whatever notification you happen to see. Then identify similar ones; group them together; and work on that group at repeated intervals. It should feel like boring maintenance work — because the goal is to make work predictable in order to predictably achieve the outcomes you desire (and then to automate the work, if you want, to free up your time). This also helps to identify low-value types of activities and then deprioritize or eliminate them. By way of your example, I want to take certain actions regarding special days involving people who are important to me (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries …). So periodically I attend to that because it's important. (Maybe that means I plan things out every week, or every month — up to you. And then the planned tasks — calling my buddy, shopping for gifts, writing and mailing cards — go on the calendar as planned work.) It's during that work period that I see triggers / upcoming items related to that group of items. Why would I want notifications or other interruptions about them any other time? Answer: only for things that are true emergencies. Maybe you should have a yearly repeating 15-minute calendar entry to call your friend on their birthday. (You are working from your calendar, right?) The other tip I can offer is to do yesterday's incoming work today, and today's incoming work tomorrow. This lets you strategically plan how you will handle all of today's work instead of getting interrupted by it today and bouncing around trying to deal with it. Moreover, very few things need to be done immediately; many problems solve themselves with time; and sleeping on things can shift a large chunk of the time-consuming processing involved with it to your subconscious mind. (Furthermore, the habit of planning your work in advance and addressing it methodically is going to drastically reduce the number of true emergencies and even typical interruptions that you'll feel the need to deal with. It's a virtuous cycle.) I'll leave you with the notions that practically everything is unimportant when you consider its place in the incalculable vastness of the universe; you never get your time back; and your health is of paramount importance. P.S.: I somehow missed that you had the birthday on your calendar. This tells me that either you're not working from your calendar (big problem) or else you added the birthday as an all-day event instead of an appointment (\"I will call my friend on their birthday every year at 12 PM and catch up for 15 minutes\"). reply",

Beyond just literature reviews, it could act as a brainstorming co-pilot.<p>Has anyone here seriously used AI (e.g., Claude for long-context paper analysis, custom GPTs on arXiv, or specialized agents) to aid in hypothesis generation, research gap identification, or drafting substantive parts of a paper?<p>What are the biggest pitfalls regarding accuracy, hallucination of citations, or superficial understanding of complex theory? How do you validate the AI's output?<p>Do you see it as a legitimate accelerator for early-stage research, or more of a productivity tool for mundane tasks? Any success stories linking it to a tangible research outcome?<p>Looking for honest experiences from academics, industry researchers, or solo discoverers.</p></p></p></p></div>",

Companies that organize community events tends to be easier to approach too, if you do it in person at small non-busy events, even better. Basically, if you see some product/company you'd like to work with, figure out what you could help them with, write them an email and point out exactly what you think could be better, and why you're perfect for them.

The \"ask for contrasting perspectives\" prompt is annoying specifically because it makes you process more information. The devil's advocate approach forces a second round of evaluation. Even just opening a fresh session adds friction that makes you reconsider the question. When I'm working in domains I know well, I catch the model drifting way faster than in areas where I'm learning. Which suggests the real problem isn't the model - it's that we're outsourcing judgment to it in areas where we shouldn't be. The uncomfortable answer might be: if you're worried the model is reinforcing your biases, you probably don't know the domain well enough to evaluate its answers anyway. reply",

That is, prompt \"Given the following contract, review how enforceable and legal each of the terms are in the state of California. <contract>\", not \"<contract> How enforceable...\". Ask the model for what the experts are saying about the topic. What does the data show? What data supports or refutes a claim? What are the current areas of controversy or gaps in research? Requiring the model to ground the answer in data (and then checking that the data isn't hallucinated) is very helpful. Have the model play the Devil's advocate. If you are a landlord, ask the question from the tenant's perspective. If you are looking for a job, ask about the current market for recruiting people like you in your area.

If I need it to argue from another perspective, I just ask for that perspective in a new session, ideally arguing both sides in temporary sessions so that the context of any other session doesn't affect it. I am also quite good at playing the devil's advocate myself. If you have some expertise, you can just come up with what I consider to be a good counterargument, and ask for an attack or defense of that argument. You can try the prompt below in your favorite thinking model and see what it says. Obviously, this is more work than some other methods. --- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following line of argumentation? Some proponents of climate-change denialism have taken a new tact: pointing out that there is a lack of practical solutions that meaningfully address the change in climate, especially given the political and social systems available. To the extent that climate mitigations are expensive, they will tend to be politically unpopular in democracies, and economically destabilizing in dictatorships. Unilateral adoption of painful solutions weakens a country's relative position among nations; it wouldn't do for, say, China to harm itself economically while the rest of the world enjoys cheap energy. We also have a gerontocracy in most countries; the people in power have no personal stake in the problems 50 years from now, and even as the effects of climate change start to become a problem, those in power are best positioned to be personally insulated. And while there are solutions like solar power that are capital intensive but pay for themselves over time, the sum total of these net positive solutions doesn't amount to a meaningful dent in the problem, nor do we need policies or willpower to support \"no-brainer\" solutions that pay for themselves. The conclusion is that negative effects of climate change are \"baked in\" by the lack of a political system (\"benevolent\" dictatorship) that could force the necessary and painful changes required, hence the entire discussion of climate change, while interesting, is partly moot. Do these people have a point? Is there evidence that we can build an effective solution from non-painful measures? Why would it matter to those in power today, what the global average temperature in 2100 is? reply",

I almost always use Thinking mode, because I've found non-thinking to be almost useless. There are rare exceptions. 'Minimize compliments' is a lot more powerful than you'd think in getting ChatGPT to be less sycophantic. \nThe parts about calculation work okay.

Where unit tests still win: algorithmic code, parsing, anything with lots of edge cases. Writing unit tests forces you to think about boundaries. Integration tests just tell you \"it worked this time.\" The worst outcome is having tests that make refactoring painful but don't catch real bugs. I've seen codebases where every internal method signature change breaks 50 unit tests that were essentially testing implementation details. reply",

The problem with this is that I miss important things and they often get buried.<p>I've spent hours and hours unsubscribing, deleting, uninstalling, toggling settings, but then I find myself reinstalling, resubscribing. It's just a mess, and exhausting to just think about.<p>The reason I'm writing this is partially to vent. I just realized that my closest friend's birthday was a few weeks ago. I had it in my calendar, but never saw the notification. Yes, I should be more organized and Yes, it's not the end of the world. but damnit, i get so much crap from this bionic appendage, and still I cant use this tool to help me with remembering important things.<p>It just seems like its getting worse every year.<p>Hopefully this is helpful to others.<p>P.S. can we please stop with the \"would you like all or some cookies\" popup on every friggin website?<p>P.P.S. can websites stop asking for permission to invade my OS?<p>P.P.P.S. does anyone else ever want to run away and be an off-grid hermit?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

My plan is to live out my favorite childhood book The Alchemist in New Zealand while retracing the LOTR filming sites with a herd of sheep and a shepherds crook. One of the sheep will be fitted with solar panels and Starlink though, cause I just gotta have my Love After Lockup. Edit: and to be clear it doesn’t have to be an all or nothing thing. You can reenable notifications on a per app basis (and on Android per notification type I believe). You can turn them on for an app for a few days to see how intrusive their notifications are. Just make it a habit to turn them off at the drop of a hat with extreme prejudice. If you need stuff for work make rules and automations to turn stuff on and off based on triggers. reply",

You won’t miss anything important and that realization is the most freeing This is pretty similar to my setup. Always on do not disturb. Typically my family and close friends communicate through a chat app, that doesn't make sound but if it's time sensitive an sms or call will make sound for starred contacts. Back on the day when phones had notification LEDs I'd setup apps to have specific colours. These days with always on OLED displays I use an app aodNotify to setup a a little spinning circle on the screen. Purple is family/friend chat app, blue is a call, green sms etc. Everything else I periodically poll for information. ie I go out of my way to check emails etc reply",

As soon as they raise an unwanted notification, the sledgehammer comes out and their privileges get permanently revoked. Developers: I don't care how important you think your news is, uninvited notifications are a red line for me. The software industry used to have a much more humane baseline in terms of the unwritten rules for how we treat our audience.  Phone-home telemetry, intrusive interruptions, addictive design... it really grinds my gears how user-hostile computing has become.  This will make me sound like a craggy old fart, but I liked it better when coding was harder and demanded more craftsmanship and skill... I feel like it attracted builders with better judgement and ethical standards more aligned to my own.  In other fields, engineers bear personal liability for their work (eg. bridge fails, the professional who signed off will bear scrutiny).  I sympathize not everyone is in a position to do so, but I would quit my job before agreeing to the kind of dirty tactics we're seeing from tech giants these days. reply",

I'm not a professional, there are probably professionals out there that can help but here's some random thoughts of what that might look like: * Take a week off work and turn off all notifications. Tell work you are unavailable. * Write anything important down on paper that happens in the next two weeks: birthdays, events, appointments, etc. so you don't miss them. A paper calendar planner works. * Turn off the phone if you can. If you need it for travel - uninstall everything unnecessary and keep all the notifications off. Phone, maps, airline, Uber, SMS, web browser are really all you need. You could ditch the airline app and just get paper boarding passes. * Do something, anything, that doesn't involve computers/phone and notifications. reply",

If such things are a distraction for you, turn them off. Unless they give you value or have an important meaning, they are not worth your attention. Depending on your hardware/software vendor, it might be capable of synchronisation between multiple devices so you don't end up getting notifications anyway, and it might have multiple profiles with time boxes, or location-aware or event-aware profiles.

The problem is that I often have multiple reminders triggering its own notification popup with sound on my phone. I don't think the Slack PMs actually use their products. Every morning is a race against time to either snooze the reminders before they trigger (which is counter-productive) or bury my phone inside my hand to limit the noise pollution if I am too late. The desktop version has its own issues, because the notifications is layered above the unmute button in my daily Teams meeting and once I manage to dismiss one of them, another pops up.

          "text": "In the early 2010s, especially as smartphones began to appear everywhere, I noticed that, along with the desktop, we now had another perpetual Disturber of Peace. One of the worst things turned out to be Notifications, something not under your control, that derails your chain of thoughts/works/routine. Ever since, I had kept every notification disabled by default. The world is becoming increasingly low-trust; hence, the default is no longer to “allow,” but to filter through a “whitelist.” Disable all Notifications by Default.[1] This is best done at the time of app installation. When asked to “Allow Notifications,” disable it right then and there. Of course, depending on your occupation and needs, a few critical notifications should be kept ON. This will be less than 10% of your app. More than 90% of the apps on your device have no reason to notify you of anything. And here is a weird but interesting thing - disable battery percentages everywhere. Personally, not on the phone and neither on the Laptop; if it dies, it dies. A simple passive notification that can keep you on your toes and stress you out the most - phone battery percentage indicator. We have become so obsessed with ‘juicing up’ our phones that our levels of happiness and relaxation decrease exponentially as the battery percentage drops. Even in 2026, I hear people’s phones make a sound when a message/email arrives. If I follow that, my phone will sing all day long. “Never be so dependent on technology that a notification is the only thing that brings you hope.” Personally, I have a different take on birthdays and have conflicting views. So, I’m sorry about that. 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2014/missing-step-productivity-activi... reply",

If also using apps like WhatsApp there may be a similar app-level setting. Get a couple of well reviewed ad blockers for your browser. I'm still astounded when I see people on their phones and dealing with ads. Especially YouTube. There are browser blockers that work for YouTube. Adding to the previous point, never install/use a company's native app. You have NO control over that. Use their web version. Addding to the previous point, iOS safari has an option to view any website in desktop mode. I imagine Android has something like that but I dunno. If a particular site has an annoying mobile web interface, try the desktop web version. If they don't allow that, use a different product. One case in point: I use Reddit heavily. I use old Reddit on web. Their app and mobile website are complete garbage. Some ad blockers may help with the \"accept cookies? Gdpr bullshit\". I don't personally bother. They're fairly innocuous and the sites are collecting all cookies anyway so it doesn't matter. The reason I'm not mentioning the specific web extensions I use is because despite being common and easy to find, I'm EXTREMELY hesitant to provide a curated list in a public forum that will get vacuumed up and probably lead to circumventions within a few weeks to months. This stuff is easy to find, is completely available in the platform-relevant app stores and only takes a little extra effort to customize after a couple of weeks of running into minor inconveniences.

If you send me a message or email I will eventually look it up and respond at appropriate time. If world is ending and someone needs urgent help they will call me. Call me too many times and I'll put you on mute. I'll still get the notification but you'll have to wait till I have time to call you back, or more probable, I'll wait until you send me a text message stating your need. One thing I hate the most is people calling on repeat. I'm old enough to remember times before mobiles and back then it had a purpose. Now it doesn't. If you call me once and I didn't picked it up that means I'm either busy or away. If you call again you're just annoying and I'll flag you as such. One thing that may set me apart is that I still consider my phone to be just that. I lived the whole mobile revolution and from time to time I've tried installing different apps, but eventually the phone for me is just that - the phone. Calling and messaging. Sure I can browse, use maps, etc. but it's a communication device. And when I don't want to communicate I just put it away. Problem solved. [EDIT] Yes, you can still send me an email or a message through a messenger application, but unless I intentionally check the app I won't even know you're there. reply",

          "text": "I'll suggest an approach that works for me. Ask yourself what it is you're actually doing / attending to / accomplishing, with regard to whatever notification you happen to see. Then identify similar ones; group them together; and work on that group at repeated intervals. It should feel like boring maintenance work — because the goal is to make work predictable in order to predictably achieve the outcomes you desire (and then to automate the work, if you want, to free up your time). This also helps to identify low-value types of activities and then deprioritize or eliminate them. By way of your example, I want to take certain actions regarding special days involving people who are important to me (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries …). So periodically I attend to that because it's important. (Maybe that means I plan things out every week, or every month — up to you. And then the planned tasks — calling my buddy, shopping for gifts, writing and mailing cards — go on the calendar as planned work.) It's during that work period that I see triggers / upcoming items related to that group of items. Why would I want notifications or other interruptions about them any other time? Answer: only for things that are true emergencies. Maybe you should have a yearly repeating 15-minute calendar entry to call your friend on their birthday. (You are working from your calendar, right?) The other tip I can offer is to do yesterday's incoming work today, and today's incoming work tomorrow. This lets you strategically plan how you will handle all of today's work instead of getting interrupted by it today and bouncing around trying to deal with it. Moreover, very few things need to be done immediately; many problems solve themselves with time; and sleeping on things can shift a large chunk of the time-consuming processing involved with it to your subconscious mind. (Furthermore, the habit of planning your work in advance and addressing it methodically is going to drastically reduce the number of true emergencies and even typical interruptions that you'll feel the need to deal with. It's a virtuous cycle.) I'll leave you with the notions that practically everything is unimportant when you consider its place in the incalculable vastness of the universe; you never get your time back; and your health is of paramount importance. P.S.: I somehow missed that you had the birthday on your calendar. This tells me that either you're not working from your calendar (big problem) or else you added the birthday as an all-day event instead of an appointment (\"I will call my friend on their birthday every year at 12 PM and catch up for 15 minutes\"). reply",

Domain should  never depend on infrastructure or application layer and so on. But the projects I got have domain that depend on infrastructure and another one where application has a reference directly to infrastructure and been told that this is correct implementation... doh..<p>I think I was kind of a good at listening for the lectures, but I now am doubting about, whether it was worth learning stuff at all lol since it's so controversial out there. I am, of course, in no position to question senior dev, but what do you guys think - is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go straight to the trash bin or am I just misunderstanding the real-work-like context?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "1. also helps you after the first 3-6 months. As in, you can't change the entire code base (if reasonably large). Not even with AI helping you with the tedious bits. Consistency is something that does have value, even if it's not global and even if the consistent thing is not how you would've done/called it. The more consistency you can get, the better, because it helps tremendously. Both you and also an AI. If things are named consistently it doesn't matter whether you call a potato a potato or a potahto. It just matters that you don't call it an orange half the time. We have a relatively good code base in this regard for example. To find things, I literally just hit the shortcut to open file/class by name, start typing the camel case for what I need and I'm usually there. Like, if I need to know what exactly we do for writing the potahto to the database, I type PoRep and I'll probably see the PotatoRepositoryImpl and I'm where I need to be. Of course not everything is roses. I might want to know what the service layer for the potahto does and start typing PotSer and I find nothing, because half the domain objects call the service layer a service and the other half calls it manager . That's OK. That's called \"local consistency\" and it happens as a code base grows and ages and different people with different opinions build in it and don't know enough about the magic of consistency and think they know better but can't or don't want to change the existing code base. As long as it doesn't get out of hand, it's not a big deal and you can slowly converge. 2. This is such a big one, thank you! Too many people don't believe in Chesterton's fence. They know so much better! Rewrite everything! And it is OK and good to question why the fence is there! Nothing is worse than \"we do it this way because we've always done it that way!\". But also, if you never question the fence's existence, you're stuck forever. This is an anecdote I found very good in this regard. A group of scientists places five monkeys in a room with a ladder and a banana on top. When one monkey tries to reach the banana, all are sprayed with cold water. Eventually, all of them stop attempting to climb. The scientists then place a new monkey who knows nothing of the water incident. When the new monkey sees the banana and tries to climb, the others prevent them from reaching it. Nobody gets sprayed any longer. The scientists slowly replace any of the original monkeys that were actually sprayed with water with new ones. Eventually there are no monkeys left that experienced the spraying. Yet no monkey ever even tries to get the banana any more. So, do challenge Chesterston's fence's existence! Try to find one of the monkeys that actually got sprayed with water, so that you may understand why the fence was there. Or in other words ask the other monkeys why the eff you can't go for the banana. And if nobody can tell you other than \"coz we've never done it like that\", then try it. For all you know, the pesky scientist with the hose is long gone! reply",

Some minor points: - What you learned in college was not a waste. - When it comes to software development, everything is controversial to someone .

It's pretty common in life to attain a level and discover you \"know nothing\" and have it feel like you're starting over from scratch. It's just an illusion, but it's also kind of true. Eg. You get your blue belt in Brazilian Jui Jujitsu, and realize there's a whole other Jedi level you weren't aware of. - Regardless, trust in your abilities, master the fundamentals, listen to mentors, and ride the wave. - The progress graph is not a flat line upwards.

This can be a healthy relationship as the real world has constraints on your time. You learn to make trade offs as you go, even if they are wrong. I like to think of learning to write software as learning to cook. You start by learning some basic skills (e.g. chopping, frying, seasoning) and you practice them through recipes. But as you really learn and become more of a chef, these are just skill sets and experiences you pull on to make the right thing in the right moment.

It's good to have confidence in those patterns, especially if you understand them and you must take ownership of your opinion of them. But now other people are going to have their own opinions and you're going to need to parse why they came to those conclusions and a lot of it will boil down to \"this was how it was done before and it worked.\" At this point you might not have the power to override their decisions without making things difficult for you, so just try to follow suit. For now you need to build and ship whatever lets you keep your job and income going, but keep studying to understand how things should be despite what work will have you do.

I think there was one course titled \"software engineering\" (as part of a 4-year degree) that may have mentioned something similar at one point. But that's about it. Which country did you study in? It's quite fascinating to me as it's such a surprise that there are places where these kind of \"design patterns\" are a core part of the degree. > is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go Most of them yes, because for most of them the answer is \"it depends\". And if we're going to be technical (and come on, this is computing so we should be) - then really the answer is \"it depends\" for every single one of them. There is not a single design pattern that applies to all coding domains. Not even \"always give your variables descriptive names\", and that's probably the one with the highest % of coverage. reply",

I have been in corporate software for nearly 20 years.  During my time there have been three completely unrelated paths: career elevation, technical brilliance, and finally seeking employment.  I cannot say if this will hold true into the future, but it has been true for a long time. First, know what you want and that will tell you who to follow.  So, let's talk about this. If you want to ascend in your career you need to focus on mastery of only two things: soft skills and conscientiousness (awareness).  Career elevation ultimately means some combination of management people and/or projects.  You actually have to care about the people you are managing or you can be a complete dick if you are an outsider who knows the right people at the proper levels.  You also need to be masterful at management of multiple work streams, calendars, and event timelines impacting multiple teams.  Imagine being in three unrelated conversations simultaneously all day long and still knowing the technical details about what is happening better than the people on each of those multiple chats/calls without exhaustion. Technical brilliance comes from building ambitious things.  If you aren't constantly building new and ever more challenging things at work then you need to be doing it outside of work.  This typically has a negative impact on career progression unless you are willing to get a PhD and make a career out of research like Roy Fielding.  It has a negative impact on career progression because demands a tremendous amount of time practicing on things that are not directly tied to the key goals of your employer's business goals. Then finally there are people whose only goal is seeking employment or raises from jumping between employers.  This is counter productive to both career elevation and technical skill growth, but can be good if you are a future founder and are trying to build out personal relationships.  I have always thought of these people as trend followers and bottom feeders from a technical skill perspective. reply",

Many times you might think something is stupid, and the person telling you about it probably thinks it's stupid too, but it's what needs to happen to keep things working without upending the whole company. The person you can both yell at about it is probably retired or dead, and likely made the right decision at the time, given what they were working with at the time. Even with projects I've had that are relatively greenfield, eventually they have to meet the existing infrastructure.

          "text": "So different colleges have different courses, and focus on different things. So what I say next is very much YMMV. Back when I did college there was a disconnect between what students thought college was for, and what colleges thought college was for. This was ultimately addressed in 2nd year, but it took me decades to really understand it. As students we went to college thinking we were being taught skills to prepare us for getting jobs. Which given the endless \"you need to go to college to get a decent job\" mantra seems reasonable. My college however believed that job skills are basically easily assimilated and can be quickly learned after you get the job. What makes it possible to learn fast are solid foundational skills and understandings. For example a chef is better off learning the science of food, and honing knife skills. Once hired they can learn French recipes or Italian recipes or whatever. In our case the complaint was about language; we learned in C and C++, with forays into assembler and Scheme. Job postings were for Cobol and Java (this was the 90s). To show us language was irrelevant we did 10 assignments in 10 days. The same problem 10 times over, but in a different language every day. And this is pre www, so harder than it would be now. But still, turns out, really easy. Now sure, good theory doesn't always make it into the real world in a perfect state. But I continue to be amazed at how much the fundamentals matter. 35 years later and I still ground my work in solid theory. And I notice a lot those around MD who are lacking that theory. So, I'd say yes, lean into the theory. Yes the real world is messy, but knowing best practices, and encouraging their use always pays off in the long term. I'll counterpoint that though that juniors always want huge sweeping changes to make it conform to their newly minted theory. Don't be that guy. It's OK to spend some time first getting to know your work system. Then you can enquire about past decisions made, and choices made. Then suggest small (and later larger) improvements. Good luck, and have fun. reply",

          "text": "The college knowledge isn't wasted - you just need to reframe how you use it. Best practices like clean architecture exist to solve specific problems: making code easier to test, change, and reason about at scale. The key insight is understanding which problems they solve and when those problems actually matter. A domain layer that depends on infrastructure might be \"wrong\" by the textbook, but if it's a small internal tool with 3 users and a 2-year expected lifespan, the coupling probably doesn't matter. The cost of the \"correct\" abstraction exceeds the benefit. What I'd suggest: when you see code that violates a pattern you learned, ask yourself \"what problem would the 'correct' approach solve here, and does that problem actually exist in this context?\" Sometimes the answer is \"yes, and this code will bite us later.\" Often it's \"no, the simpler approach is fine for this use case.\" The ability to make that judgment - knowing when to apply rigor and when simplicity wins - is what separates effective senior devs from people who cargo-cult patterns regardless of context. reply",

          "text": "Quick answer: the code tends to mirror the way the project is run. Read on if you want my elaboration and advice. The good thing about being a junior dev is that your decisions don't have much impact yet and nobody trusts you anyway. The bad thing is that people trust experience way too much and will eventually start to dump more work on you and not question you. That's when the real struggle begins. This struggle doesn't stop until you retire. It's the precious nature of limited time and attention. Other people's struggles have produced the strange code you're looking at right now. Your gut is right. Don't trust that code, but also know that your time is limited and you need to stay focused on your assigned tasks. Stay curious and take mental note, but never make a move until you know you can without consequence. You have other stuff to do. Eventually bugs will be found or new features will be assigned to you. Only then do you have sufficient information to act. The description of the bug or feature tells you more than the code ever did. Code just tells you how. Bugs and requirements will tell you what it does and why. So now here's my advice. Teamwork is hard work and people can develop antisocial behavior that causes dysfunction and ultimately bad code. Nobody ever truly has the full picture or full authority. Don't trust anyone who claims to regardless of titles or years of experience. On the opposite end, some people seek solitary refuge in their work but doing the same will hold you back too. Avoid staying siloed amongst the devs, and run from the places that force you to. Don't buy into hype and always do the minimum that works. Good code is less code, but expect to write more. Your education is valuable, and your eyes don't deceive you. Don't let people get to you and it will be fine. reply",

The first thing you should do is to absolutely question your team if you think  their ideas aren't good and have better suggestions. Also stop looking at titles. They are entirely made up and meaningless in this industry. You can leave the company, found a startup as 'Founder/CEO', sell it and make yourself CEO of Product/VP or President of new company and framing that as 'career growth'. Lastly, in a world where we have 'vibe-coders', 'AI builders' openly admitting that they have not written a single line of code before and are shipping products like sandcastles into production instead of a production-grade secure fortress, the latter being robust against security threats, made out of 'best practices' and stands the test of time and the former crumbles the moment you touch it or leave it. I think you would want to know how to build secure software with best practices so that almost no-one can attack your software and is even also willing to pay for it. reply",

Ultimately, the customer really doesn’t care about the internals as long as whatever they’re using solves their immediate problem. They hold the ultimate card because they will just switch to another service provider if they’re cheaper, even if their product is worse. So don’t become jaded. Become an expert in systems engineering and work on making things better.

Optimize for the best solution given the $ and time constraints. For example, adding better test coverage might help reduce issues that result in headaches and lost productivity, or worse down times. Or adding a better interface to a poorly written implementation so you’re not tossing out everything just reducing the surface area for problems. Good luck!

It also seems unreasonable for a company to force me to buy an $1000 device just for the privilege of submitting my resume.<p>[edit: Forgot to mention, I own precisely zero iProducts.]</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Well... I went through the iforgot.apple.com flow.  If the past is any indication, I'll likely have to wait 30 or 90 days to get a response.  This just seems... sub-optimal.  It's a very strange set of hoops to have candidates jump through. And sad, too.  I think my cover letter was one of the best I've ever written.  Now no one will be able to appreciate it but me. This is not how things were in the old days.  Back then we would just show up at a job site and after working for a few weeks go to HR and say \"hey.  I didn't get a check.\"  And then when HR couldn't find your records, they just assumed they were lost somewhere and helpfully set you up as an employee with information you gave them. How you have changed, outlaw sili valley. [Edit]\nSo when I say I have zero iProducts, that's not entirely true.  I do have an old 2015 era iMac.  But the first thing I did with it was put a new hard drive in it and boot up FreeBSD.  And then I installed Linux and installed FreeBSD as a VM under Linux because I have nothing better to do with my time.  And somewhere along the way L4 got wedged in there, because you're not a TRUE power user unless you have L4 running under bhyve under FreeBSD under KVM under linux on hardware the manufacturer would really prefer you just run Mach on.  I am wild.  I am the wind. So I found the old macOS hard drive and installed it.  It really did not want to boot.  It told me so many horrible things when I tried to boot, mostly that I really should visit an apple support web site.  The AppleID I'm trying to recover is the same one I used to create a macOS account with.  I wonder if apple knows I've installed Linux, FreeBSD and L4/Linux on their hardware and have marked my AppleId as \"unholy spawn of Satan\" ?  I guess if the roles were reversed I might think anyone who installed L4 on Apple Hardware is \"not to be trusted.\" Or more seriously...  I wonder if you don't boot macOS or log into macOS with your AppleId every now and again, you go on the \"naughty\" or \"potentially naughty\" list.  This whole affair really makes me miss my Atari 520ST.\n[/Edit] reply",

          "text": "Update... After a bit of work, I was able to boot the old hard drive with macOS and tried to log into apple services.  Of course it rejected my existing AppleId password, but this time with a working iMac, I asked it to send a reset code to my iMac. It seemed to think it sent one to my iMac, but nothing ever showed up.  The internet says it should have showed up on my iMac's screen or in the upper right corner of the screen.  No dice. This is similar to what happened at the Apple Store when we tried the \"use someone else's iProduct\" to reset the password.  The login page seemed to think it had sent a PIN, but it never showed up at the end device. I suspect that because I'm in the iForgot 24 hour cool down period, nothing is going to work.  They claim they will send instructions to my phone (I hope they realize my phone doesn't have iMessage) in 15 hours for what to do while waiting 30 or 90 days to try the reset again. This sort of reminds me when we got bought out and we had problems with our dev certificate.  We had released a couple versions of \"iFoo\" using our domain \"foo.com\".  Then we got bought out by bar.com and wanted to release future versions of iFoo under bar.com branding.  When we eventually got ahold of a human, they said we would have to re-release iFoo as iBar and re-submit it as a new app.  We eventually did this, but they responded that iBar was confusingly similar to an existing app called iFoo and they wouldn't allow it to be released in the app store.  Then they revoked the foo.com dev cert because of shinanigans.  When we tried to explain to them that we were following the instructions they had given us (and sending them emails and screenshots where they told us what to do,) they closed the support ticket and revoked bar.com's dev cert as well. I think Apple processes work very well for the usual case, but they don't think through some of the corner cases. The irony is the role I was attempting to apply for was one that would (partially) oversee working out these corner cases and what Apple should be doing in those situations.  I was invited to apply for this position explicitly because I had encountered similar problems in the past. My suspicion is I'll have a 30 day wait at the end of the initial iForgot 24 hour cool down.  If I'm still looking for a job in 30 days, I'll probably still submit my resume.  It seems that Apple really needs some help in this area. But I applied for a job in '93 and didn't get it and I've been told you're only allowed to apply to Apple once (despite having worked on the Qualcomm baseband processor in the original iPhone and as a contractor in the very early days of macontosh.)  And I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about me talking publicly about identity management corner cases.  I suspect the chance they would really care to hire me is fairly low. But if anyone from Apple ever reads this, feel free to contact me if you need more details on what inputs I provided to your system and what the responses were. reply",

          "text": "My running joke after showing off some amazing LLM-driven work is... if you think this is impressive, I once opened a modal dialog on an Apple IIGS in 65C816 assembly I don't think you need to learn BASIC, if you know concepts like conditionals and looping and indexing.  It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

Also, don't forget the HUGE number of resources for 6502 assembly programming that are available in the https://archive.org/ magazine and book sections: https://archive.org/search?query=6502 Rodney Zaks' books are great - I like especially \"6502 Games\", which taught me a lot back in the day: https://archive.org/download/6502g/6502Games.pdf I'm also especially fond of the easy6502 emulator - its a very handy tool to have while studying 6502 techniques: https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/ Its not absolutely necessary to learn BASIC before Assembly, but it will definitely help you understand the resources of the machine better if you can debug BASIC ROM code.  My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

          "text": "Nothing wrong with internet searches (though I find Google is most useful for results from Google sites). But HN is full of 6502 enthusiasts, so I approve of tapping their collective wisdom to discover personal favorites and recommendations. Unlike modern computers, 8-bit systems were expected to be programmed by their owners! As a result there are many books from the 8-bit, pre-internet era explaining exactly how to do so, and many of those books are conveniently available on the modern internet (perhaps via a google or other search, or on archive.org, etc.) Many systems also came with user instruction manuals explaining how to program them. Here is the Apple II BASIC manual from 1978: https://archive.org/details/Apple_II_Basic_Programming_Manua... Note how it explains everything from scratch, including how to hook the Apple II up to a TV, how to use the keyboard, and how to start up BASIC. BASIC was designed as a simple but effective programming language that could be learned by computing novices (first year college students) in an afternoon. Here is the original Dartmouth BASIC manual (23 pages long!) from 1964: https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basicmanual_1964.pdf reply",

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs. As crowds moved along these lines together to a degree as they emerged, it might help to look at publication dates for the books of the time, and use what's found in the earlier texts to help you with later concepts. reply",

If you only have experience programming in modern languages (Javascript, etc.), learning the Applesoft BASIC will also be super helpful before you learn 6502, as you'll learn how to get by without ... A) the following language conveniences: - function names (it's all line numbers), - variables with more than 2 letters, and B) the following modern concepts: - function calls (no stack other than for GOSUB, use subroutines with dedicated variables for passing parameters instead), - scoped variables (everything is global), - dynamic allocation (you have to DIM arrays with the max size upfront), - anything object-like like structs or classes (hack it with multi-dimensional arrays) - other fancy stuff like callbacks, promises, hashtables and any other data structure beyond arrays. and that will nicely prepare you for 6502 assembly (or any kind of assembly really). The advantage in 6502 assembly is you can implement most of B) yourself if you do need it. reply",

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

          "text": "Starting with Assembly is simply a bad idea because the tooling is terrible, and the learning curve of the tooling is steep. Filled with arcane codes and abbreviations and workflow right out the gate. Programming concepts are pretty much universal. Being distanced from computer architecture is not a limitation for novice programmers, Python et al succeeds for a reason. If you're determined to start with assembly, then I hope you can find someone to help you get started with all the machinations necessary to get from LDA #0 to A9 00 with as little drama as possible. Someone to show you how to use the assembler, what the directives mean, the linker, a symbolic debugger (if you're lucky). Someone to provide you with a .DUMPREG \"START OF SORT\" and .DUMPMEM BUFF $80 \"AFTER INPUT\" macros that you can liberally scatter throughout your code so you actually progress and get some insight into what the heck you code is doing. Perhaps some way to stop your programs that doesn't include hitting the reset button on the machine. I mention that because, again, the tooling is terrible. All of the is easier said than done. None of the assembly books address this, none of the assembly program reference guides do either. Assembly is VERY black box. It's a large step up to even get started. It's much easier to \"learn programming\" first at a higher level, where you can quickly progress and succeed, before turning into the dark hole that is assembly, particularly on older machines. At least on a KIM-1 you can hit the STOP button and cursor through memory (being conscious that the memory architecture of the KIM is quite funky), something that simple is quite difficult on an Apple ][. reply",

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites. The lack of immediacy helps keep the emotional reaction in check (it's not as addictive of course). reply",

          "text": "The stall you're describing is the difference between users who think your tool is clever and users who have a problem painful enough to pay for solving it. The most consistent pattern I've seen work: solve a problem developers already know they have, in a workflow they already use daily. Not \"you should care about X\" but \"you already care about X and it's annoying - here's a faster way.\" The dead ends are usually targeting problems developers don't feel yet. You can have a technically superior testing framework, but if the team's current setup \"works fine\" (even if it's objectively worse), there's no urgency to switch. The narrow ICP approach works when it's narrow enough that you can actually list the companies. Not \"Series A SaaS companies\" but \"these specific 30 companies using this exact tech stack with this known pain point.\" At that scale you can do real research on each one and outbound becomes viable. The integrations play is interesting - it works when you're solving a gap in an ecosystem people are already bought into. Building a better Slack bot is hard. Building a tool that makes Datadog + PagerDuty work better together has a clearer value prop to people already paying for both. One thing that seems underrated: finding where your ICP already hangs out and being genuinely helpful there without selling anything. Not \"build in public\" as content strategy, but actually solving problems in public. The conversion comes from \"oh, the person who helped me with that gnarly bug has a product\" not from announcement posts. reply",

The goal is to make a performant debugger, from what I understand its target audience is mostly game developers, but you can use it for other programs obviously.

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

I've worked in a company that, for all intents and purposes, had the same thing - single thread & multi process everything (i.e. process per core), asserts in prod (like why tf would you not), absurdly detailed in-memory ring buffer binary logs & good tooling to access them plus normal logs (journalctl), telemetry, graphing, etc. So basically - it's about making your software debuggable and resilient in the first place. These two kind of go hand-in-hand, and absolutely don't have to cost you performance. They might even add performance, actually :P reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

From what I’ve heard, at this scale only a few tools (like Claude’s desktop app) are genuinely helpful, so I haven’t experimented much with other AI coding services.<p>At the same time, I keep seeing posts about people building 20k lines of code and launching a SaaS in a single 40-hour weekend. That’s made me question whether I’m being overly cautious, or just operating under outdated assumptions.<p>I already rely on AI quite a bit, and one clear benefit is that I now understand parts of the codebase that I previously wrote without fully grasping. Still, at my current pace, it feels like I’ll need several more months of development, followed by several more months of testing, before this can become a real production service. And that testing doesn’t feel optional.<p>Meanwhile, products that are described as being “vibe coded” don’t seem to be getting particularly negative evaluations.<p>So I’m wondering how people here think about this now.\nIs “you don’t really understand the code, so it’ll hurt you later” still a meaningful criticism?\nOr are we reaching a point where the default approach to building software itself needs to change?<p>I’d especially appreciate perspectives from people working on larger or more complex systems.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "> Is “you don’t really understand the code, so it’ll hurt you later” still a meaningful criticism? That is one of the strongest valid criticisms. Even if we ignore the possibility that the code that is vibed will be buggy and insecure, the real long-term problem is not having someone who understands the system. Almost every well maintained app has one or more people who grok the whole thing, who can hear a problem described and know right where the fix will be. They'll have a mental model of the whole system and can advise on architecture changes and other refactors. They can help teach the codebase to new folks. And most importantly, when an outage happens, they are the ones who quickly get you back up and running. The lack of those people is why legacy systems are brittle and hard to maintain, so vibe coding a complex app puts you directly into that painful legacy maintenance mode. One thought people are starting to throw out there is, \"But the AI can just re-write the whole app every time we have a bug, so we never need to know things to that level.\" But those people have never worked with a customer base who gets ticked off when the same bugs re-appear on every release, or when a dozen small UI changes shows up on every release. Vibe coding might give you some working code. But working code is an astoundingly low bar to set for actually building a product that pleases a customer base. reply",

I really only ever saw snippets claude code shows here and there. I asked a lot of questions, much more than asking it to make changes. I only gave it high-level architectural guidance like \"use MVVC\", etc. I did a lot of manual testing and reading logs.

You hear about the ones that worked, not the hundreds that hit walls at hour 15 when the AI-generated architecture couldn't accommodate a requirement the person hadn't anticipated. What vibe coding genuinely accelerates: the iteration cycle between \"I think I want X\" and \"seeing X running.\" That's valuable for discovery - you learn what you actually need faster by building and discarding. What it doesn't change: the hard part of software was never typing. It's figuring out what the system should actually do when edge case Y meets constraint Z. That work is invisible in LOC metrics but determines whether your product works in production. The people succeeding with vibe-coded SaaS likely have deep domain knowledge (they know WHAT to build) or are building in well-trodden territory (auth + CRUD + payments - patterns the models have seen millions of times). For your 60k LOC complex business logic case: the question isn't \"should I vibe code more?\" but \"what's my verification strategy?\" If you can specify behavior clearly enough to write tests, you can probably let AI write the implementation. If you can't specify behavior precisely, that's the bottleneck - and no amount of faster code generation helps. reply",

The 20k LOC weekend SaaS stories are real but missing context. Either the person has deep domain knowledge (knows WHAT to build, AI helps with HOW), or it's mostly boilerplate with thin business logic. For complex systems, the testing point is key. AI generates code faster than you can verify behaviour. The bottleneck shifts from \"writing code\" to \"specifying behaviour precisely enough that you know when it's right\".

For a larger, more complex system, the real barrier is understanding what needs done well enough that you can build something that can do it.  (In my opinion, that has always been the real barrier.) reply",

The moat is most people aren't using LLMS, most people aren't building products, most people who might built it will never hear of your product, people will have other ideas competing for their attention, people are incompetent, and all the work that happens after the coding. How many people do you think are out there vibe coding things? Aren't companies built on execution? Or do we now build companies on tech stacks alone? Before LLMS, how could a solo dev get a moat? Any company could hire a team to replicate your product. They might not care how much it costs them. \"Hours spent coding\" isn't the moat. reply",

It seems like AI is not going to go away, and instead of building reliable software, managers seem to push people to use AI more, as long as they ship products. Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Why pay artists for music, when you can just generate endless amount of AI music?<p>And even things like \"doing day to day chores\" are being automated away with tools like AI assistants. The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh*t throughout the day. How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI.<p>So my question HN: What's the point anymore? Why keep going and where to?</p></p></div>",

Becoming a successful writer / musician, is already hard. With software, it was easier, but in my opinion, it will become hard as well. There will be individuals in the software development who are like Taylor Swift, because they know how LLMs work, and how to optimize them to squeeze one more KPI. The rest will just be nobodies. And sure, if you think you are an extraordinary person, or you were born in the right environment, then you probably don't have to worry. But I'm an average Joe, who wants to live an average Joe's life, but it's being taken away from me.

Now, from the consumer side you can claim \"what do you care about the mainstream, just look for good taste, and you will find it\", and I agree with you. But I do not speak about the consumer side, but rather the producer side. As a producer, I want to produce \"good taste\", but if there is very little demand for good taste things, I might struggle to sustain myself while producing based on merit. In the end, the reason enshittification exists, is because \"good taste\" stuff became too popular and the authors decided to capitalize on it (can't blame them when you have a mortgage to pay, and family to feed), and turn it into \"mainstream crap\". I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that creating good taste is not easy. And it will become even harder as the mainstream will expand and capture AI generated content, leaving people who believe in creation based on merit, fighting for the crumbs. reply",

Reminds me when there were massive booms on outsourcing software to low cost labor markets. Most of the software born out of those markets was slop and not much different than what we see today. Good taste still matters in most work. I am pretty big proponent of AI but I don’t think AI can write a book that I enjoy. Similarly I don’t believe AI can write software end to end without a humans input of good taste. Sure you can brute force it but like those early years of outsourcing I bet it won’t be maintainable or well running. reply",

Summaries won’t replace books, generated music won’t replace artists, and assistants won’t replace doing things yourself. They’ll replace the lowest friction default.

There's more than you can ever listen to. You'll get tired of music as a whole before that. Here's some things AI can't do for you: Relationships and interacting with good people, every kind of sports and physical endeavour including any adventure you can think of, enjoying the perfection of nature. Psychedelic experiences and spiritual experiences. All of these require very little or no money.

          "text": "\"The golden rule of clean architecture is to strive for high cohesion and low coupling.\" Perhaps communities will sprout up following that rule? Regarding money, one needs to ask themselves what will be the impact of tokenized assets? Perhaps being able to take ownership of kibbutz-like places will give them a sense of belonging and purpose. Doesn't matter how much technology there is, people need to live somewhere and will adapt by finding a place they can optimize for happiness. It'll be like starting a game of Civilization from scratch but with all the advanced technologies intact. People may also go back to the early-human modes of survival of the first-nations groups. Digital and electric technologies aren't healthy things to be around. Do you want to live in the range of a 10G antenna or near a massive solar array? The naturalists may end up happier and healthier than the tech-heads. It's about taking/using what works for you and leaving the rest. Worth noting that if someone really had an answer to your questions, would they state the truth here? How do you know the robots won't come and just kill us all when they can because we have no power/influence/value? Where will people migrate to in order to avoid that? Antarctica? The moon? Underground to avoid weaponized satellites? Conscience and consciousness really needs to grow with technology, really that's the challenge of today. Always has been. How will people support the sick, old, disabled and retarded? Start there and work backwards, or how does one avoid those things altogether somehow and go beyond Homo Sapiens? reply",

          "text": "I remember back in the day, the days of chisel and hammer. I could feel the stone, and the impact of the hammer vibrating into my hand. It was pleasant, and I could feel that every hit really meant something to shape the future of the stone, and thereby the building. Customers and contractors alike told me how great it was to see me work that stone. So I kept swinging that hammer. Then I was told about some electrical chisel that was supposed to make my life better. Sure, I made more money, but the work was gone. It just shakes; it doesn't vibrate. I get numb, not proud. I have to take breaks, because my hands can't handle it. It's awful. What's the point, I asked? But then I started talking to my colleagues during those breaks. I even discovered I had a relative in common with one. While chipping away at stone, no one ever wanted to stand close to me, and I had spent all this time proudly creating stone chips all day long! I still chip away at stone sometimes, but only when there's no one else around to talk to at breaktime. --- You are not going to be able to stop change. The world never stood still, it's just that changes happen step-wise, and it's unlikely any one step affects _you_ profoundly. This time, the step affects you (and me.) You are standing in front of a steamroller and shouting \"stop!\" We'll find a new way to be humans. It won't look like the Instagram times. It won't look like the Myspace times. It won't look like the Rolodex times. It'll be new. What can you do with it that makes you happy? reply",

I'm barely touching current \"AI\" other than certain bits of code completion that are on by default in VS and are the right mix of occasionally useful (saving a few tens of keystrokes) and easy to ignore when not. When it gets to the point where I can't compete without using LLMs heavily, I'll have to do something else. Perhaps wait tables somewhere with Spanish customers as I'm trying to learn the language, it won't be much or a pay cut because by the point where someone of my years can't compete at all, almost anyone will be able to do a shite job with LLMs so programming will be heading towards being a minimum-wage job anyway. > Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Yours doesn't have to be. I started writing bits to go online again after many years not bothering. It isn't intended for public consumption, I'm deliberately doing nothing that would be called SEO in fact I'm going anti-SE in some ways, though it isn't hidden should I chose to pass a link to someone or if they decide to pass it on further. It is intended for me and a select few, if someone else finds it somehow and likes it then good the them, and much of the point of making it is the joy of making something. Everyone else using LLMs isn't going to take that from me. > Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Because the summary may be wrong, or technically correct but with entirely the wrong tone or missing key details a summary should have. Or because you want to read the post - you don't have to use the summary. I don't read the summary generated as part of most searches these days, reading them is optional. I don't make effort to stop them being made though (using porn mode, adding “fuck”/“fucking” to search terms, etc.) - hopefully making them waste resources on generating things that are never used will et noticed and they'll ramp that down a bit at least for accounts like mine. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Before AI, did you just skip to the last few pages to see what happened? If not, then just keep reading like you did before. Avoiding the slop books that are flooding the market ATM might be more of a concern, but there was plenty written before the LLM bubble started to keep you in things to read for a lifetime. > The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh t throughout the day.* Other hobbies. I like trail running (or if in a slower mood, country walking), AI isn't going to stop me doing that. HEMA and other activities with friends too. > How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI. That is a completely different question to the rest where you are asking about things that you would do for enjoyment, and is a bigger societal and philosophical concern than I have time to chew on right now… > What's the point anymore? Same as it was before: do what you need to do to survive, then do what you need to do to enjoy any remaining time after that. Perhaps I'm helped here by being back on the up after a couple of years recovering from proper burnout: I know the way things are going won't make me feel worse than that, and I survived that. Current politics and other social issues away from tech on the other hand… > Why keep going? When all hope feels truly lost, at least keep going out of spite. > Why keep going and where to?

It's all a bunch of proof-of-concept research papers tied together into a house of cards that only works if multiple layers of virtual environments are all precisely the same version it was developed on, there's far more memory free than the models and their output occupy, and the lunar tide is within range. A few more layers of GUI and IDE would probably make the whole thing collapse. reply",

On top of that, everyone will eventually adjust to it, so to stay notable and memorable, it has to constantly change, so it can always get in the way.

The \"ask for contrasting perspectives\" prompt is annoying specifically because it makes you process more information. The devil's advocate approach forces a second round of evaluation. Even just opening a fresh session adds friction that makes you reconsider the question. When I'm working in domains I know well, I catch the model drifting way faster than in areas where I'm learning. Which suggests the real problem isn't the model - it's that we're outsourcing judgment to it in areas where we shouldn't be. The uncomfortable answer might be: if you're worried the model is reinforcing your biases, you probably don't know the domain well enough to evaluate its answers anyway. reply",

Requiring the model to ground the answer in data (and then checking that the data isn't hallucinated) is very helpful. Have the model play the Devil's advocate.

          "text": "I don't have copy-paste prompts. If I need it to argue from another perspective, I just ask for that perspective in a new session, ideally arguing both sides in temporary sessions so that the context of any other session doesn't affect it. I am also quite good at playing the devil's advocate myself. If you have some expertise, you can just come up with what I consider to be a good counterargument, and ask for an attack or defense of that argument. You can try the prompt below in your favorite thinking model and see what it says. Obviously, this is more work than some other methods. --- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following line of argumentation? Some proponents of climate-change denialism have taken a new tact: pointing out that there is a lack of practical solutions that meaningfully address the change in climate, especially given the political and social systems available. To the extent that climate mitigations are expensive, they will tend to be politically unpopular in democracies, and economically destabilizing in dictatorships. Unilateral adoption of painful solutions weakens a country's relative position among nations; it wouldn't do for, say, China to harm itself economically while the rest of the world enjoys cheap energy. We also have a gerontocracy in most countries; the people in power have no personal stake in the problems 50 years from now, and even as the effects of climate change start to become a problem, those in power are best positioned to be personally insulated. And while there are solutions like solar power that are capital intensive but pay for themselves over time, the sum total of these net positive solutions doesn't amount to a meaningful dent in the problem, nor do we need policies or willpower to support \"no-brainer\" solutions that pay for themselves. The conclusion is that negative effects of climate change are \"baked in\" by the lack of a political system (\"benevolent\" dictatorship) that could force the necessary and painful changes required, hence the entire discussion of climate change, while interesting, is partly moot. Do these people have a point? Is there evidence that we can build an effective solution from non-painful measures? Why would it matter to those in power today, what the global average temperature in 2100 is? reply",

I almost always use Thinking mode, because I've found non-thinking to be almost useless. There are rare exceptions. 'Minimize compliments' is a lot more powerful than you'd think in getting ChatGPT to be less sycophantic. \nThe parts about calculation work okay. It's an improvement over defaults, but you should still verify. \nIt's better at working with text, but still fucks it up a lot.\nThe instructions about handling factual information work very well. It will push back on my or its own claims if they're unsupported. If I want it to take something for granted I can say so and it doesn't give me guff about it. \nI want to adjust the prompt so it pays more attention to the quality of the sources it uses.

Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.<p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):<p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.<p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:<p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)\n\n  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment\n\n  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)\n</code></pre>\nMy own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I’m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?<p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution\n(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)\n\n  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)\n\n  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)\n\n  calendar\n\n  \"in my head\"\n</code></pre>\nWhich one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention\n\n  noisy suggestions / interruption\n\n  hallucinations / wrong suggestions\n\n  workflow change / migration cost\n\n  pricing\n\n  others</code></pre></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It commits to memory, not to action. I really don't care about having a whole searchable, tagged database; I hardly ever look at those notes again. At work I have topic-based Markdown notes. Sometimes I collect information about a topic for a few weeks or months, and eventually turn it into a proper guide (making guides is my job). I also LOVE paper notebooks, because they become a beautiful timeline of sketches, to-do lists, thoughts and plans. When I finish a notebook, I scan it then throw it in a drawer. I also use Obsidian daily notes to journal, mostly because it's easier to open an app than to write in a notebook. I don't do anything special with those notes, unless I'm trying to \"debug\" something happening in my life. [0] https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-... reply",

It seems you're more accustomed to treating stored information as memories rather than a knowledge base. That's perfectly fine.

For a lot of us, what we store is really a snapshot of attention, curiosity, anxiety, and identity at a moment in time — more like a personal log than a database. One framing that helps me is: the archive isn’t “truth”, it’s “evidence of what I cared about”, and it’s only useful when it reduces friction for a real moment (re-entry, reflection, or a concrete next step). Otherwise it’s just noise. Do you find it more useful as a mirror (patterns about yourself), or as a tool (helping you make decisions / take action)? reply",

In other cases it forces me to actually understand what I'm feeling in order to put it into words. In a sense those notes could be write-only and still be useful. In other cases these notes are a complement to my photos. They show a different aspect of my life at a given moment. My photos don't show that on September 4, 2015, I had a massive crush on someone. I have built a timeline that combines my journals, photos, sketches, geolocation, Google searches and other things. It reveals a far more nuanced picture of me at a given time. I also have more technical notes. Those are a bit of a \"collection of facts\". It's a bit like putting all the parts on the table, and slowly organising them into a coherent structure. This is how I approach bigger topics before I understand them fully. Then my notes act as a sort of medium-term memory. When I finish a project, I usually have a bunch of leftover notes and todos that I don't intend to ever finish. That's why I say that notes are not an obligation. reply",

Either you use Bases (first-party plugin) or Dataview (third-party plugin). The second one is a little more ironed out as of now, so I keep using that (but will probably migrate in the future). For the first two lists you create queries that simply look at file's creation/modification time. For the third one, Obsidian gives you an option to \"star\" a note, so you query for that. reply",

          "text": "That makes total sense. Latency kills the workflow, and “advertised as AI” carries baggage even if the underlying technique is harmless. One nuance: the way I’m thinking about this isn’t “you type a query and wait for an LLM”. It’s more like local indexing/pre-computation so retrieval is instant, and any heavier processing happens ahead of time (or during a scheduled review) so it never blocks you. Then you can consume it as a pull-based view or a tiny daily digest—no interruptions, no spinning cursor. If you could pick one: would you prefer a deterministic synonyms/alias layer (instant, fully controllable), or a local semantic index that improves recall but still feels “tool-like” rather than “AI”? I’m exploring a similar local-first, low-noise approach (more context in my HN profile/bio if you’re curious). reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a project in this realm. Basically I am building a \"personal\" spyware/data collection software suite. Kind of in the same realm as ms recall but more focused on security/privacy with sensible cryptographic defaults where needed. It is basically a server/data store and client agents, currently the agent is only for linux end user devices. The agent records evdev events (keystrokes/mouse movement), currently active window, clipboard history, shell commands issued and browsing behaviour. It runs as its own user and different functionality is compartmentalized into their own processes. Data is encrypted at rest. I'm still looking into how to best handle sensitive data in-memory at runtime. It stores these events in a persistent queue on the clients and one-way syncs it to the server. If a client is offline for a bit it syncs it when it comes back online. As such, I am also trying to minimize storage used. The idea is that rather than overwhelmingly linking stuff manually, e.g. with obsidian, locality of reference seems more useful as a baseline. In this data set, links by time are valued the most. In the future I'd like to add also the screenshot/video feature using hashes and perceptual hashes or an RDP like way to store as little data as possible. For now I'm mostly in the architecting phase but I do have an early working version. Really looking for suggestions architecture wise too. So far I came up with my own binary format to save events on the clients but I'm unsure if it's the right way to go. There are many challenges to be thought about, such as changing hardware configuration (display plugged in), protecting against statistical analysis (e.g. keystroke bursts), deletion of data across sources if required, how to make sure the system can run smoothly for a decade, etc. reply",

          "text": "While I do hoard notes I've realized over the years that the main reason I write notes is as a memory aid.  If I write it down I remember it better, and I'm more likely to do it.  Notes also act as a filter because I write stuff down, sometimes review the notes later, and decide what I wrote down isn't worth doing, so making a note of an idea essentially gives me a delay to review the idea and decide if it is worth doing.  I do also record links, keeping them in wiki pages (along with wiki pages for notes about various projects); I started doing that because browser histories today seem to autodelete old links.  Putting them into a wiki makes them searchable.  I keep journals as well, which are also searchable.  I don't necessarily want to be reminded of my notes and wiki/journal entries, I know they are there, I mainly want to call them up when I decide I need them.  That's the main drawback of paper notes, I can't search them.  I've tried scanning them, but it's tedious and they don't translate to ASCII text well, and drawings are not searchable.  I've considered using one of the e-paper notepads instead of paper notes, but I'd need a notepad handy in every room of the house and that would cost too much, and the procedures to automatically sync them to a central location don't seem very reliable (and I don't want to sync personal notes to some public cloud). So for me, an AI that suggests stuff would be annoying.  An AI that could take some vague search terms and my history and could pull old information out of notes that don't necessarily have the keywords I enter, using the context provided by my history might be useful.  So for example, I may remember I happened across a design for the DSP algorithms in guitar pedals, but the URL or note may not even mention DSP, so something that could turn a search for \"guitar pedal DSP\" into finding a link for an audio processing web page I visited would be useful.  The AI would probably have to scan all the web pages I visit to be able to store enough context to be useful for a search like that.  Doing this for 20 years or more might run into some scalability/cost issues. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your feedback.\nThat makes sense — for many people notes are primarily a memory/idea-filter, not a task generator. Context, long-term memory, and storage issues are indeed challenges currently facing AI and large language models (LLMs), and they're not unique to the scenarios we're discussing. However, with technological advancements, I believe these issues will eventually be resolved. Based on your requirements, it seems you need to grant the AI sufficiently broad access and privacy permissions. That said, leveraging what you've already stored, achieving the fuzzy retrieval functionality you mentioned should be feasible. It's impressive that you can recall exactly where to find your notes! That said, active retrieval still requires you to remember what you're looking for. I think your fuzzy retrieval concept shares some similarities with what I'm aiming for—where the AI offers suggestions based on your intended actions, even when you haven't consciously decided what to search for. Wouldn't you welcome that kind of assistance? reply",

The envisioned product, Concerns, acts as a bridge, linking your current concerns and target tasks to your knowledge base/resource repository and action list (which could be to-do lists, calendars, etc.), forming an organic closed-loop system. Using target/active projects within Concerns as triggers, it retrieves relevant information from your resource repository. It proactively pushes solutions, plans, and suggestions for users to filter. Selected items then enter the user's action list. The goal is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in a lightweight manner, without altering existing habits for using resource repositories or action lists. This idea stems from my own pain points, and I genuinely hope that while solving my own issues, it might also address broader needs. Regarding your response: It's interesting that AI tagging primarily aids by adding extra searchable keywords. However, I'd prefer broader content and semantic search/matching capabilities without relying solely on tags—though tagging remains a viable implementation approach.\nThanks for the mymind reference—I'll explore it.

The problem is that I almost never come back to what I have saved. A simple example is YouTube. I save videos to watch later because I am not in the right headspace at the time. Then I avoid them completely. I think part of the resistance is that I know watching them properly will demand attention and probably lead to follow-up work, and I am rarely in a mode where I want that interruption. I have thought about the whole “second brain” idea, but I worry it would just become a dumping ground. Nothing would really resurface when it actually matters. I would mostly be relying on myself to remember that I once made a note about something when I happen to be working on a related problem. Lately I have been thinking about the idea of a passive, radio style feed that summarises the information I have collected and plays it back to me, so I can at least consume each item once. You see those TV shows about people who hoard. They cannot throw things away because they might be important one day. This feels uncomfortably similar. Maybe the real problem is not how we store information. Maybe it is that we aren't filtering hard enough on what is actually worth keeping in the first place. reply",

          "text": "This resonates a lot. “Save now so I don’t derail myself” is rational in the moment, but it creates a pile that later feels like a commitment (attention + follow-up work), so you avoid it. I think you’re pointing at two separate problems that get tangled: 1. Re-entry: how to resurface the right item when you’re actually in the right mode 2. Filtering: deciding what’s worth keeping so the backlog doesn’t become guilt The “radio-style passive feed” is interesting because it changes the contract: you’re not promising yourself you’ll do deep work, you’re just letting the system replay what you captured at a low cognitive cost. If it worked, it could also become a filter: only the stuff that still feels valuable on playback deserves a second pass. One question: if you had a “listen/read later” mode, would you prefer it to be time-based (10 minutes a day) or context-based (only when you mark yourself as in a “curious/exploration” headspace)?

A tool could surface notes as *options* only when a thread is active, then write back only via diffs to `Next steps` / `Log` (human-approved), keeping it deterministic.

One direction I’m exploring is to stop treating context as a single ground-truth stream and instead use cheap, probabilistic hints: a small “active projects” list (explicit but constrained), plus weak signals (recent files, open tabs, issue activity), and then ask for confirmation only when confidence is low. Calendars are a great example of why “seems firm” isn’t actually firm. If you were designing this, which would you rather tolerate: (a) fewer suggestions but higher precision, or (b) more coverage with lightweight confirmation prompts?

Is there a timeline that requires things to be done before it becomes invalid or increases liability? Secondly, remembering to do actions instead of sitting down and doing something that gives some dopamine. I decide I want to work on a project on my computer. So I go sit down in front of the computer and... I've already forgotten the project, now it's time to play a game or read Hacker News instead. Lastly -- it's the things that I \"don't know\". Let's say I want to build a robotic lawnmower. There are plenty of robotic lawnmowers already but I want to build my own. I know where to find the source code (or I can make my own). I don't know where to find the tools, where to source components, or who to ask for help assembling heavy things; I don't know how to assess risks (what happens if this thing catches fire on my lawn while I'm in the kitchen? what happens if it drives into the street and hits a car? or worse, what happens if it drives into the neighbor's kids?). > 2.What best represents “active project context” for you today? In my head, mostly. Documents in random places like ~/Documents/<project-name>, or a todo.md in the project root. Hard to remember what <project-name> is for or when I last did anything of value for it though. > 3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that If the AI does not run 100% on my machine, then it's not getting anything important. That means no notes, no personal projects that have business value. Business value includes comments or ideas to improve other peoples' products! I've seen too many times my comments end up turning into someone else's pay-me project and I see none of the rewards. Speaking of which, here I am giving you valuable information for free. After that, it's pricing. If I spend $20 on a weekend project, that's fine. If I have to spend $20 for every task, then it'll be yet another project that is only ever half-finished. reply",

I ran the numbers and it was going to take 24 hours of crunching on my 7900xtx. I just gave up instead. Zero setup should include not needing to do that. 3 would be the hardest but most useful thing. The problem is that it's scattered around different computers and networks that don't talk to eachother. We could have a file in SharePoint on one system referencing a file on an SMB share on a completely different network. It's a big pain and very difficult to work with but it's not something I expect software running on my computer with access to a subset of the information to be able to solve. reply",

And I hear you on cross-network fragmentation — in a lot of real environments the hardest part isn’t search quality, it’s that data lives on different machines, different networks, and you only have partial visibility at any given time. If you had to pick, would you rather have: 1.instant local indexing over whatever is reachable right now (even if incomplete), or 2.a lightweight distributed approach that can index in-place on each machine/network and only share metadata/results across boundaries?

Do you think the right answer is always “accept the constraint and curate harder”, or is there a middle ground where you can keep sources where they are but still get reliable re-entry (even if it’s incomplete/partial)?

The problem with this is that I miss important things and they often get buried.<p>I've spent hours and hours unsubscribing, deleting, uninstalling, toggling settings, but then I find myself reinstalling, resubscribing. It's just a mess, and exhausting to just think about.<p>The reason I'm writing this is partially to vent. I just realized that my closest friend's birthday was a few weeks ago. I had it in my calendar, but never saw the notification. Yes, I should be more organized and Yes, it's not the end of the world. but damnit, i get so much crap from this bionic appendage, and still I cant use this tool to help me with remembering important things.<p>It just seems like its getting worse every year.<p>Hopefully this is helpful to others.<p>P.S. can we please stop with the \"would you like all or some cookies\" popup on every friggin website?<p>P.P.S. can websites stop asking for permission to invade my OS?<p>P.P.P.S. does anyone else ever want to run away and be an off-grid hermit?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

My plan is to live out my favorite childhood book The Alchemist in New Zealand while retracing the LOTR filming sites with a herd of sheep and a shepherds crook. One of the sheep will be fitted with solar panels and Starlink though, cause I just gotta have my Love After Lockup. Edit: and to be clear it doesn’t have to be an all or nothing thing. You can reenable notifications on a per app basis (and on Android per notification type I believe). You can turn them on for an app for a few days to see how intrusive their notifications are. Just make it a habit to turn them off at the drop of a hat with extreme prejudice. If you need stuff for work make rules and automations to turn stuff on and off based on triggers. reply",

Typically my family and close friends communicate through a chat app, that doesn't make sound but if it's time sensitive an sms or call will make sound for starred contacts. Back on the day when phones had notification LEDs I'd setup apps to have specific colours. These days with always on OLED displays I use an app aodNotify to setup a a little spinning circle on the screen.

If such things are a distraction for you, turn them off. Unless they give you value or have an important meaning, they are not worth your attention. Depending on your hardware/software vendor, it might be capable of synchronisation between multiple devices so you don't end up getting notifications anyway, and it might have multiple profiles with time boxes, or location-aware or event-aware profiles. Some of them are self-learning (to various degrees of usefulness), but either way, reduce the device to what you need it for. reply",

          "text": "In the early 2010s, especially as smartphones began to appear everywhere, I noticed that, along with the desktop, we now had another perpetual Disturber of Peace. One of the worst things turned out to be Notifications, something not under your control, that derails your chain of thoughts/works/routine. Ever since, I had kept every notification disabled by default. The world is becoming increasingly low-trust; hence, the default is no longer to “allow,” but to filter through a “whitelist.” Disable all Notifications by Default.[1] This is best done at the time of app installation. When asked to “Allow Notifications,” disable it right then and there. Of course, depending on your occupation and needs, a few critical notifications should be kept ON. This will be less than 10% of your app. More than 90% of the apps on your device have no reason to notify you of anything. And here is a weird but interesting thing - disable battery percentages everywhere. Personally, not on the phone and neither on the Laptop; if it dies, it dies. A simple passive notification that can keep you on your toes and stress you out the most - phone battery percentage indicator. We have become so obsessed with ‘juicing up’ our phones that our levels of happiness and relaxation decrease exponentially as the battery percentage drops. Even in 2026, I hear people’s phones make a sound when a message/email arrives. If I follow that, my phone will sing all day long. “Never be so dependent on technology that a notification is the only thing that brings you hope.” Personally, I have a different take on birthdays and have conflicting views. So, I’m sorry about that. 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2014/missing-step-productivity-activi... reply",

They work fine as reminders, but I am starting to hate the way notifications are implemented. I often use \"remind me tomorrow\" that will notify me at 9am. The problem is that I often have multiple reminders triggering its own notification popup with sound on my phone. I don't think the Slack PMs actually use their products. Every morning is a race against time to either snooze the reminders before they trigger (which is counter-productive) or bury my phone inside my hand to limit the noise pollution if I am too late. The desktop version has its own issues, because the notifications is layered above the unmute button in my daily Teams meeting and once I manage to dismiss one of them, another pops up. I swear I could have made an entire stand-up bit about this if I had any comedic talent.

This is more of a psychology issue rather than technology. You need some sort of dopamine detox. I'm not a professional, there are probably professionals out there that can help but here's some random thoughts of what that might look like: * Take a week off work and turn off all notifications. Tell work you are unavailable. * Write anything important down on paper that happens in the next two weeks: birthdays, events, appointments, etc. so you don't miss them. A paper calendar planner works. * Turn off the phone if you can. If you need it for travel - uninstall everything unnecessary and keep all the notifications off. Phone, maps, airline, Uber, SMS, web browser are really all you need. You could ditch the airline app and just get paper boarding passes. * Do something, anything, that doesn't involve computers/phone and notifications. reply",

If you send me a message or email I will eventually look it up and respond at appropriate time. If world is ending and someone needs urgent help they will call me. Call me too many times and I'll put you on mute. I'll still get the notification but you'll have to wait till I have time to call you back, or more probable, I'll wait until you send me a text message stating your need. One thing I hate the most is people calling on repeat. I'm old enough to remember times before mobiles and back then it had a purpose. Now it doesn't. If you call me once and I didn't picked it up that means I'm either busy or away. If you call again you're just annoying and I'll flag you as such. One thing that may set me apart is that I still consider my phone to be just that. I lived the whole mobile revolution and from time to time I've tried installing different apps, but eventually the phone for me is just that - the phone. Calling and messaging. Sure I can browse, use maps, etc. but it's a communication device. And when I don't want to communicate I just put it away. Problem solved. [EDIT] Yes, you can still send me an email or a message through a messenger application, but unless I intentionally check the app I won't even know you're there. reply",

If also using apps like WhatsApp there may be a similar app-level setting. Get a couple of well reviewed ad blockers for your browser. I'm still astounded when I see people on their phones and dealing with ads. Especially YouTube. There are browser blockers that work for YouTube. Adding to the previous point, never install/use a company's native app. You have NO control over that. Use their web version. Addding to the previous point, iOS safari has an option to view any website in desktop mode. I imagine Android has something like that but I dunno. If a particular site has an annoying mobile web interface, try the desktop web version. If they don't allow that, use a different product. One case in point: I use Reddit heavily. I use old Reddit on web. Their app and mobile website are complete garbage. Some ad blockers may help with the \"accept cookies? Gdpr bullshit\". I don't personally bother. They're fairly innocuous and the sites are collecting all cookies anyway so it doesn't matter. The reason I'm not mentioning the specific web extensions I use is because despite being common and easy to find, I'm EXTREMELY hesitant to provide a curated list in a public forum that will get vacuumed up and probably lead to circumventions within a few weeks to months. This stuff is easy to find, is completely available in the platform-relevant app stores and only takes a little extra effort to customize after a couple of weeks of running into minor inconveniences. This isn't a \"compile Linux from scratch\" kind of problem. reply",

          "text": "I'll suggest an approach that works for me. Ask yourself what it is you're actually doing / attending to / accomplishing, with regard to whatever notification you happen to see. Then identify similar ones; group them together; and work on that group at repeated intervals. It should feel like boring maintenance work — because the goal is to make work predictable in order to predictably achieve the outcomes you desire (and then to automate the work, if you want, to free up your time). This also helps to identify low-value types of activities and then deprioritize or eliminate them. By way of your example, I want to take certain actions regarding special days involving people who are important to me (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries …). So periodically I attend to that because it's important. (Maybe that means I plan things out every week, or every month — up to you. And then the planned tasks — calling my buddy, shopping for gifts, writing and mailing cards — go on the calendar as planned work.) It's during that work period that I see triggers / upcoming items related to that group of items. Why would I want notifications or other interruptions about them any other time? Answer: only for things that are true emergencies. Maybe you should have a yearly repeating 15-minute calendar entry to call your friend on their birthday. (You are working from your calendar, right?) The other tip I can offer is to do yesterday's incoming work today, and today's incoming work tomorrow. This lets you strategically plan how you will handle all of today's work instead of getting interrupted by it today and bouncing around trying to deal with it. Moreover, very few things need to be done immediately; many problems solve themselves with time; and sleeping on things can shift a large chunk of the time-consuming processing involved with it to your subconscious mind. (Furthermore, the habit of planning your work in advance and addressing it methodically is going to drastically reduce the number of true emergencies and even typical interruptions that you'll feel the need to deal with. It's a virtuous cycle.) I'll leave you with the notions that practically everything is unimportant when you consider its place in the incalculable vastness of the universe; you never get your time back; and your health is of paramount importance. P.S.: I somehow missed that you had the birthday on your calendar. This tells me that either you're not working from your calendar (big problem) or else you added the birthday as an all-day event instead of an appointment (\"I will call my friend on their birthday every year at 12 PM and catch up for 15 minutes\"). reply",

Domain should  never depend on infrastructure or application layer and so on. But the projects I got have domain that depend on infrastructure and another one where application has a reference directly to infrastructure and been told that this is correct implementation... doh..<p>I think I was kind of a good at listening for the lectures, but I now am doubting about, whether it was worth learning stuff at all lol since it's so controversial out there. I am, of course, in no position to question senior dev, but what do you guys think - is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go straight to the trash bin or am I just misunderstanding the real-work-like context?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "1. also helps you after the first 3-6 months. As in, you can't change the entire code base (if reasonably large). Not even with AI helping you with the tedious bits. Consistency is something that does have value, even if it's not global and even if the consistent thing is not how you would've done/called it. The more consistency you can get, the better, because it helps tremendously. Both you and also an AI. If things are named consistently it doesn't matter whether you call a potato a potato or a potahto. It just matters that you don't call it an orange half the time. We have a relatively good code base in this regard for example. To find things, I literally just hit the shortcut to open file/class by name, start typing the camel case for what I need and I'm usually there. Like, if I need to know what exactly we do for writing the potahto to the database, I type PoRep and I'll probably see the PotatoRepositoryImpl and I'm where I need to be. Of course not everything is roses. I might want to know what the service layer for the potahto does and start typing PotSer and I find nothing, because half the domain objects call the service layer a service and the other half calls it manager . That's OK. That's called \"local consistency\" and it happens as a code base grows and ages and different people with different opinions build in it and don't know enough about the magic of consistency and think they know better but can't or don't want to change the existing code base. As long as it doesn't get out of hand, it's not a big deal and you can slowly converge. 2. This is such a big one, thank you! Too many people don't believe in Chesterton's fence. They know so much better! Rewrite everything! And it is OK and good to question why the fence is there! Nothing is worse than \"we do it this way because we've always done it that way!\". But also, if you never question the fence's existence, you're stuck forever. This is an anecdote I found very good in this regard. A group of scientists places five monkeys in a room with a ladder and a banana on top. When one monkey tries to reach the banana, all are sprayed with cold water. Eventually, all of them stop attempting to climb. The scientists then place a new monkey who knows nothing of the water incident. When the new monkey sees the banana and tries to climb, the others prevent them from reaching it. Nobody gets sprayed any longer. The scientists slowly replace any of the original monkeys that were actually sprayed with water with new ones. Eventually there are no monkeys left that experienced the spraying. Yet no monkey ever even tries to get the banana any more. So, do challenge Chesterston's fence's existence! Try to find one of the monkeys that actually got sprayed with water, so that you may understand why the fence was there. Or in other words ask the other monkeys why the eff you can't go for the banana. And if nobody can tell you other than \"coz we've never done it like that\", then try it. For all you know, the pesky scientist with the hose is long gone! reply",

Some minor points: - What you learned in college was not a waste. - When it comes to software development, everything is controversial to someone . And ever-changing. - You need to spend a good 12-18 months acquiring situational awareness. It's pretty common in life to attain a level and discover you \"know nothing\" and have it feel like you're starting over from scratch. It's just an illusion, but it's also kind of true. Eg. You get your blue belt in Brazilian Jui Jujitsu, and realize there's a whole other Jedi level you weren't aware of. - Regardless, trust in your abilities, master the fundamentals, listen to mentors, and ride the wave. - The progress graph is not a flat line upwards. There's peaks and valleys, but as long as it trends up, you're doing good. reply",

          "text": "Be very careful who you learn from.  There are a lot of pretenders out there and doing what they do will steer you very wrong. I have been in corporate software for nearly 20 years.  During my time there have been three completely unrelated paths: career elevation, technical brilliance, and finally seeking employment.  I cannot say if this will hold true into the future, but it has been true for a long time. First, know what you want and that will tell you who to follow.  So, let's talk about this. If you want to ascend in your career you need to focus on mastery of only two things: soft skills and conscientiousness (awareness).  Career elevation ultimately means some combination of management people and/or projects.  You actually have to care about the people you are managing or you can be a complete dick if you are an outsider who knows the right people at the proper levels.  You also need to be masterful at management of multiple work streams, calendars, and event timelines impacting multiple teams.  Imagine being in three unrelated conversations simultaneously all day long and still knowing the technical details about what is happening better than the people on each of those multiple chats/calls without exhaustion. Technical brilliance comes from building ambitious things.  If you aren't constantly building new and ever more challenging things at work then you need to be doing it outside of work.  This typically has a negative impact on career progression unless you are willing to get a PhD and make a career out of research like Roy Fielding.  It has a negative impact on career progression because demands a tremendous amount of time practicing on things that are not directly tied to the key goals of your employer's business goals. Then finally there are people whose only goal is seeking employment or raises from jumping between employers.  This is counter productive to both career elevation and technical skill growth, but can be good if you are a future founder and are trying to build out personal relationships.  I have always thought of these people as trend followers and bottom feeders from a technical skill perspective. reply",

In a job, you'll almost always be in a brownfield (you have to work within the existing systems and legacy to make things work). There could have been decisions made 30 years ago when the compute landscape looked very different that are still impacting decisions today. Many times you might think something is stupid, and the person telling you about it probably thinks it's stupid too, but it's what needs to happen to keep things working without upending the whole company. The person you can both yell at about it is probably retired or dead, and likely made the right decision at the time, given what they were working with at the time. Even with projects I've had that are relatively greenfield, eventually they have to meet the existing infrastructure. When that happens, my perfect little applications has to get hacked to bits to cover various edge cases due to a company acquisition or some section of the environment that is non-standard for whatever reason. I find this part of the job quite painful, but it's necessary for the tools to actually work. We've brought in some vendors from time to time who are supposed to write some code for us. They follow best practices and do everything by the book. There stuff doesn't work. We end up having to throw all of it out and re-write it the second they leave.

          "text": "So different colleges have different courses, and focus on different things. So what I say next is very much YMMV. Back when I did college there was a disconnect between what students thought college was for, and what colleges thought college was for. This was ultimately addressed in 2nd year, but it took me decades to really understand it. As students we went to college thinking we were being taught skills to prepare us for getting jobs. Which given the endless \"you need to go to college to get a decent job\" mantra seems reasonable. My college however believed that job skills are basically easily assimilated and can be quickly learned after you get the job. What makes it possible to learn fast are solid foundational skills and understandings. For example a chef is better off learning the science of food, and honing knife skills. Once hired they can learn French recipes or Italian recipes or whatever. In our case the complaint was about language; we learned in C and C++, with forays into assembler and Scheme. Job postings were for Cobol and Java (this was the 90s). To show us language was irrelevant we did 10 assignments in 10 days. The same problem 10 times over, but in a different language every day. And this is pre www, so harder than it would be now. But still, turns out, really easy. Now sure, good theory doesn't always make it into the real world in a perfect state. But I continue to be amazed at how much the fundamentals matter. 35 years later and I still ground my work in solid theory. And I notice a lot those around MD who are lacking that theory. So, I'd say yes, lean into the theory. Yes the real world is messy, but knowing best practices, and encouraging their use always pays off in the long term. I'll counterpoint that though that juniors always want huge sweeping changes to make it conform to their newly minted theory. Don't be that guy. It's OK to spend some time first getting to know your work system. Then you can enquire about past decisions made, and choices made. Then suggest small (and later larger) improvements. Good luck, and have fun. reply",

          "text": "Yep, just like learning anything the intro level summaries don't reflect reality they just help you get your head around new things. In the real work experience every project, team, and company are a little bit unique in how they respond to the requirements and politics of the moment. Everyone is trying to get something done and how purely it follows some pattern or rule is only relevant as far as it helps get the work done. What you learned wasnt useless - it was probably very helpful for understanding or at least getting exposed to lots of concepts that you'll need. However, just like the joke about physicists and their spherical cows, the perfect algorithms and architecture rules from school aren't even close to the whole story in the trenches. A non-engineering anecdote - had a math professor tasked with determining a fit line for and integration of a bunch of sensor data (needed the total area under the curve, classic math test problem). College me imagined trying to craft bespoke integratable functions and maybe some multi part fitting optimization but I knew my little list of memorized formulas couldn't touch this real life data so I was looking forward to the veteran approach. Math guy printed it, eyeballed to fill in the gaps with a pen, cut it out, and weighed it against a sample of \"1x1\" unit squares of the paper. I was flabbergasted but the dude was so obviously right -- one off task, collected data with no clear pattern, didn't need crazy precision. The \"obvious\" answer took far less time than anything I had in mind and was plenty good enough for the problem at hand. tl;dr - what you learned so far wasn't wasted it was simply the very beginning of filling up your mental toolbox reply",

Best practices like clean architecture exist to solve specific problems: making code easier to test, change, and reason about at scale. The key insight is understanding which problems they solve and when those problems actually matter. A domain layer that depends on infrastructure might be \"wrong\" by the textbook, but if it's a small internal tool with 3 users and a 2-year expected lifespan, the coupling probably doesn't matter. The cost of the \"correct\" abstraction exceeds the benefit. What I'd suggest: when you see code that violates a pattern you learned, ask yourself \"what problem would the 'correct' approach solve here, and does that problem actually exist in this context?\" Sometimes the answer is \"yes, and this code will bite us later.\" Often it's \"no, the simpler approach is fine for this use case.\" The ability to make that judgment - knowing when to apply rigor and when simplicity wins - is what separates effective senior devs from people who cargo-cult patterns regardless of context. reply",

And if we're going to be technical (and come on, this is computing so we should be) - then really the answer is \"it depends\" for every single one of them.

Lastly, in a world where we have 'vibe-coders', 'AI builders' openly admitting that they have not written a single line of code before and are shipping products like sandcastles into production instead of a production-grade secure fortress, the latter being robust against security threats, made out of 'best practices' and stands the test of time and the former crumbles the moment you touch it or leave it.

          "text": "Quick answer: the code tends to mirror the way the project is run. Read on if you want my elaboration and advice. The good thing about being a junior dev is that your decisions don't have much impact yet and nobody trusts you anyway. The bad thing is that people trust experience way too much and will eventually start to dump more work on you and not question you. That's when the real struggle begins. This struggle doesn't stop until you retire. It's the precious nature of limited time and attention. Other people's struggles have produced the strange code you're looking at right now. Your gut is right. Don't trust that code, but also know that your time is limited and you need to stay focused on your assigned tasks. Stay curious and take mental note, but never make a move until you know you can without consequence. You have other stuff to do. Eventually bugs will be found or new features will be assigned to you. Only then do you have sufficient information to act. The description of the bug or feature tells you more than the code ever did. Code just tells you how. Bugs and requirements will tell you what it does and why. So now here's my advice. Teamwork is hard work and people can develop antisocial behavior that causes dysfunction and ultimately bad code. Nobody ever truly has the full picture or full authority. Don't trust anyone who claims to regardless of titles or years of experience. On the opposite end, some people seek solitary refuge in their work but doing the same will hold you back too. Avoid staying siloed amongst the devs, and run from the places that force you to. Don't buy into hype and always do the minimum that works. Good code is less code, but expect to write more. Your education is valuable, and your eyes don't deceive you. Don't let people get to you and it will be fine. reply",

Optimize for the best solution given the $ and time constraints. For example, adding better test coverage might help reduce issues that result in headaches and lost productivity, or worse down times.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">On Twitter, Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code) recently said that nearly 100% of the code in Claude Code is written by Claude Code, and that he personally hasn’t written code in months. Another tweet, from an OpenAI employee, went: \"programming always sucked [...] and I’m glad it’s over.\"<p>This \"good riddance\" attitude really annoys me. It frames programming as a necessary evil we can finally be rid of.<p>The ironic thing is that I’m aiming for something similar, just for different reasons. I also want to write less code.<p>Less code because code equals responsibility. Less code because \"more code, more problems.\" Because bad code is technical debt. Because bugs are inevitable. Less code because fewer moving parts means fewer things can go wrong.<p>I honestly think I enjoy deleting code more than writing it. So maybe it’s not surprising that I’m skeptical of unleashing an AI agent to generate piles of code I don’t have a realistic chance of fully understanding.<p>For me, programming is fundamentally about building knowledge. Software development is knowledge work: discovering what we don’t know we don’t know, identifying what we do know we don’t know, figuring out what the real problem is, and solving it.<p>And that knowledge has to live somewhere.<p>When someone says \"I don’t write code anymore,\" what I hear is: \"I’ve shoved the knowledge work into a black box.\"<p>To me there’s a real difference between:<p>- knowledge expressed in language (which AI can produce ad nauseam), and<p>- knowledge that solidifies as connections in a human mind.<p>The latter isn’t a text file. It isn’t your \"skills\" or \"beads.\" It isn’t hundreds of lines of Markdown slop. No. It’s a mental model: what the system is, why it’s that way, what’s safe to change, what leverage the abstractions provide, and where the fragile assumptions lie.<p>I’ve always carried a mental model of the codebase I’m working in. In my head it’s not \"code\" in the sense of language and syntax. It’s more like a \"mind palace\" I can step into, open doors, close doors, renovate, knock down a wall, add a new wing. It happens at a level where intuition and intellect blend together.<p>I'm not opposed to progress. Lately, with everything going on, I’ve started dividing code into two categories:<p>- code I don’t need to model in my head (low risk, follows established conventions, predictable, easy to verify), and<p>- code I can't help modelling in my head (business-critical, novel, experimental, or introduces new patterns).<p>I’m fine delegating the former to an AI agent. The latter is where domain knowledge and system understanding actually forms. That’s where it gets interesting. That’s the fun part. And my \"mind palace\" craves to stay in sync with it.<p>Is the emerging notion that understanding code is somehow optional something you are worried about?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The metaphor I'd use is, can you understand the a story if you don't read it in the original language? Code is a language that describes the function. I want to say, I've lived through the time (briefly) where folks felt if you didn't understand the memory management or, even assembly, level ops of code, you're not going to be able to make it great. High level languages, obviously, are a counter-argument that demonstrate that you don't necessarily need to understand all the details to deliver an differentiable experience. Personally, I can get pretty far with a high-level mental model and deeper model of key high-throughput areas in the system. Most individuals aren't optimizing a system, they're building on top of a core innovation. At the core you need to understand the system. Code is A language that describes it but there's others and arguably, in a lot of cases, a nice visual language goes much further for our minds to operate on. reply",

In particular, none of them have developed strong unit testing skills, and they let the LLM mock everything because they don't know any better, when they should generally only mock API dependencies. Sometimes LLM will even mock integration tests, which to me isn't generally a super good idea. So the tests that are supposed to validate the code are completely worthless.

On one hand, it can be unpleasant to sort through obscure syntactical gobbledegook, like tracing around multiple levels of pointer indirection, but then again, I have found a certain enjoyable satisfaction in such things. It can be tough, but a good tough. It does seem to me that the people who consistently get the best results from AI coding aren't that far away from the code. Maybe they aren't literally writing code any more, but still communicating with the LLM in terms that come from software development experience. I think there will still be value in learning how to code, not unlike learning arithmetic and trigonometry, even if you ultimately use a calculator in real life. But I think there will also still be value in being able to code even in real life. If you have to fix a bug in a software product, you might be able to fix it with more precise focus than an LLM would, if you know where to look and what to do, resulting in potentially less re-testing. Personally, I balk at the idea of taking responsibility for shipping real software product that I (or, in a team environment, other humans on my team) don't understand. Perhaps that is my aerospace software background speaking -- and I realize most software is not safety-critical -- but I would be so much more confident shipping something that I understood how it worked. I don't know. Maybe in time that notion will fade. As some are quick to point out, well, do you understand the compiled/assembled machine code? I do not. But I also trust the compilation process more than I trust LLMs. In aerospace, we even formally qualify tools like compilers to establish that they function as expected. LLM output, especially well-guided by good prompts and well-tested, may well be high quality, but I still lack trust in it. reply",

Apple's public docs say it's impossible.<p>Maybe there's an email alias I can use to submit my resume instead of buying an iProduct?<p>I guess I could get a dirt cheap sim for my (non-apple) phone and use it for a day, just to sign up for a new AppleId.

It's a very strange set of hoops to have candidates jump through. And sad, too.  I think my cover letter was one of the best I've ever written.  Now no one will be able to appreciate it but me. This is not how things were in the old days.  Back then we would just show up at a job site and after working for a few weeks go to HR and say \"hey.  I didn't get a check.\"  And then when HR couldn't find your records, they just assumed they were lost somewhere and helpfully set you up as an employee with information you gave them. How you have changed, outlaw sili valley. [Edit]\nSo when I say I have zero iProducts, that's not entirely true.  I do have an old 2015 era iMac.  But the first thing I did with it was put a new hard drive in it and boot up FreeBSD.  And then I installed Linux and installed FreeBSD as a VM under Linux because I have nothing better to do with my time.  And somewhere along the way L4 got wedged in there, because you're not a TRUE power user unless you have L4 running under bhyve under FreeBSD under KVM under linux on hardware the manufacturer would really prefer you just run Mach on.  I am wild.  I am the wind. So I found the old macOS hard drive and installed it.  It really did not want to boot.  It told me so many horrible things when I tried to boot, mostly that I really should visit an apple support web site.  The AppleID I'm trying to recover is the same one I used to create a macOS account with.  I wonder if apple knows I've installed Linux, FreeBSD and L4/Linux on their hardware and have marked my AppleId as \"unholy spawn of Satan\" ?  I guess if the roles were reversed I might think anyone who installed L4 on Apple Hardware is \"not to be trusted.\" Or more seriously...  I wonder if you don't boot macOS or log into macOS with your AppleId every now and again, you go on the \"naughty\" or \"potentially naughty\" list.  This whole affair really makes me miss my Atari 520ST.\n[/Edit] reply",

          "text": "Another Update... at the end of the iforgot process, Apple is supposed to send you an update within 24 hours as to what the disposition of your password reset request will be.  In the past, if you opt not to receive a PIN via a registered iProduct, I've seen them say \"we're going to wait 30 days and then allow you to reset your password.\"  I imagine this is to discourage \"bad actors\" from launching massive efforts of password resetting.  If a bad guy was able to convince Apple that they were the TRUE owner of an account, maybe that would give them an advantage in stealing services or user data.  So sure, introducing a waiting time is not the worst idea in the world. About 15 hours ago, I went through the process again and the response was (and I paraphrase) \"tsk. tsk. do not annoy us with your password reset attempts.  we're going to tell you more about how to recover in 15 hours.\"  Again... annoying, but not horrible.  If we're trying to make things difficult for bad actors, this isn't that big of an annoyance. But at the end of the 24 hour waiting period, I still hadn't received an email from Apple at either of the email accounts I had used while trying to reset my AppleId.  (The first is the one the AppleId was explicitly tied to and the second was an alt I use mostly for newsletters and subscribing to web site updates I'm halfway interested in.  I used that because I couldn't remember if I had ever told Apple about that address.)  And that seemed frustrating.  You told me you were going to send me info about resetting my password, but you've welched on the deal. And then I had a disturbing thought... Several years ago I created an AppleId with my work phone and a completely different throw-away gmail address.  After digging up the password for that account, I logged in and sure enough... there's the email from Apple. The only thing I can think is Apple tied my IP Address or location to all three email addresses involved and somehow conflated them together.  I send a reset request from me@not-a-gmail-domain.com and get a response on havent_used_this_address_in_a_year@gmail.com.  That is very, very weird. But the good news is Apple says I only have to wait 7 days to reset the password on this account. I've been thinking about getting back into writing code for the PinePhone I bought a few years ago.  Maybe I will get a pre-paid t-mob or mint sim and try to create a new AppleId at a coffee shop on the far side of town. I can't say this has filled me with a great deal of optimism.  Obviously this isn't happening very often and I'm a corner case.  Otherwise we would surely have heard from thousands of people saying \"I can't log into my Apple account!\"  I'm also sure that when the Apple people were thinking through the process flows, they didn't assume I might try to reset my password while in the 24 hour iForgot wait state. I had been a registered Apple Developer since the late 80s, though the email address in question was only attached to my dev account since around 2006.  AppleIds as we know them have gone through changes... 2FA... removing questions... adding the ability to reset from an iProduct.  My guess is my id was generated shortly after AppleIds became a thing.  Then I stopped using it for a while and they changed the schema of the database holding AppleID details and maybe I didn't log in during some critical time frame.  Then I tried to log in and got marked as a bad guy trying to attack the security of Apple's user credential integrity.  I'm not... but of course, if I was I wouldn't admit it. In any event, I'm sure my original AppleId is hopelessly horked.  And that id was tied to the mobile number I've had since 1998.  I suspect if I try to use that number again, apple will take a look at my IP geolocation, match it to previous attempts to recover the password and assume I'm again a bad guy trying to do bad things.  If this hypothesis is correct, maybe my neighbors will have problems registering iProducts. Apple can, of course, do whatever the heck it wants.  I suspect they don't care enough to modify their processes because the number of people wedged in this state are vanishingly small.  Millions (billions?) of AppleIds have been registered.  Who cares if some dude from Seattle can't ever access Apple services with email or phone identifiers they want to use. I suspect the answer to this is going to be: a) spin up an entirely new email address.  I don't think apple will have a problem with me using gmail as I'm sure they have millions of customers that already use it. b) get a new phone number.  Like I said, I was thinking about doing some coding on my PinePhonePro, so that's not a completely bad idea. c) go across town to a coffee shop (or maybe the Apple store, do they have free wifi there?) and register a new AppleId. d) NEVER FORGET THE PASSWORD I USED. e) NEVER USE THAT AppleId AT MY HOME. This is probably overkill, but Apple has successfully hidden the details of their user credential processes and I have to imply state and state transitions from their public behaviour.  I really don't want to spent too much more time on this.  (Now that I think about it... the problems we had with our dev certificate a few years back absolutely had the same \"actual state is hidden behind an opaque wall of process\" characteristic.) All these problems are, I'm sure, Apple's way of limiting the effectiveness of social engineering attacks.  And that's something I can respect.  But if you're the by-catch of Apple's dragnet, it's absolutely annoying. reply",

Or use OpenCore Patcher to boot off of a usb stick and install a more recent version of macOS on your real mac. In this case. iMessage and iCloud should just work because it’ll pick up your genuine serial number. [0] https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/i... The likely issue you’re having on an older Mac and an older macOS is that it has an Apple root certificate that’s now expired and unable to register with either of those things. You’re SOL on anything prior to 10.10 Yosemite…. The apple root certs in 10.10 through 10.15 expired in 2019 and the installers for 10.10 through 10.15 were re-distributed by Apple with root certs expiring in 2029 [1] - (internet recovery should download and reinstall the new updated version with updated root certs if yours shipped with at least 10.10 Yosemite. You have to use the hotkey for internet recovery - not the recovery partition on your HDD) However….. OpenCore patcher will even let you install Tahoe, which doesn’t have this problem and will even get updates for another …(?) it’s the last Intel version , so whenever Apple says to hell with Intel I guess.

          "text": "Update... After a bit of work, I was able to boot the old hard drive with macOS and tried to log into apple services.  Of course it rejected my existing AppleId password, but this time with a working iMac, I asked it to send a reset code to my iMac. It seemed to think it sent one to my iMac, but nothing ever showed up.  The internet says it should have showed up on my iMac's screen or in the upper right corner of the screen.  No dice. This is similar to what happened at the Apple Store when we tried the \"use someone else's iProduct\" to reset the password.  The login page seemed to think it had sent a PIN, but it never showed up at the end device. I suspect that because I'm in the iForgot 24 hour cool down period, nothing is going to work.  They claim they will send instructions to my phone (I hope they realize my phone doesn't have iMessage) in 15 hours for what to do while waiting 30 or 90 days to try the reset again. This sort of reminds me when we got bought out and we had problems with our dev certificate.  We had released a couple versions of \"iFoo\" using our domain \"foo.com\".  Then we got bought out by bar.com and wanted to release future versions of iFoo under bar.com branding.  When we eventually got ahold of a human, they said we would have to re-release iFoo as iBar and re-submit it as a new app.  We eventually did this, but they responded that iBar was confusingly similar to an existing app called iFoo and they wouldn't allow it to be released in the app store.  Then they revoked the foo.com dev cert because of shinanigans.  When we tried to explain to them that we were following the instructions they had given us (and sending them emails and screenshots where they told us what to do,) they closed the support ticket and revoked bar.com's dev cert as well. I think Apple processes work very well for the usual case, but they don't think through some of the corner cases. The irony is the role I was attempting to apply for was one that would (partially) oversee working out these corner cases and what Apple should be doing in those situations.  I was invited to apply for this position explicitly because I had encountered similar problems in the past. My suspicion is I'll have a 30 day wait at the end of the initial iForgot 24 hour cool down.  If I'm still looking for a job in 30 days, I'll probably still submit my resume.  It seems that Apple really needs some help in this area. But I applied for a job in '93 and didn't get it and I've been told you're only allowed to apply to Apple once (despite having worked on the Qualcomm baseband processor in the original iPhone and as a contractor in the very early days of macontosh.)  And I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about me talking publicly about identity management corner cases.  I suspect the chance they would really care to hire me is fairly low. But if anyone from Apple ever reads this, feel free to contact me if you need more details on what inputs I provided to your system and what the responses were. reply",

You'll find a smattering of political posts in them, but that's an inevitable side effect of living in abnormal political times. https://scrollprize.org/ - The Vesuvius Challenge: Using high intensity X-ray scans and computation to attempt to retrieve lost scrolls from Pompei; real uplifting Sci-Fi stuff! Possibly the most heartwarming thing I know of on the internet; snatching ancient knowledge from the flames of history! What could be more poetic? https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline - In the Pipeline: The blog of Derek Lowe (pharmaceutical chemist), (in)famous for articles like \"Sand Won't Save You This Time\" Always interesting, though a lot of the chemistry goes way way over my head. Some political stuff lately, unavoidably given the current secretary of health. https://blog.dshr.org/ - David Rostenthal: Digital preservationist. https://www.jeffgeerling.com - Jeff Geerling: Raspberry Pi, Arm, digital radio, and other nerdery. I enjoy his videos, but I love that he does a plaintext version (first?) that's not just a transcript. https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/ - Rob Pike: Programming luminary (Go, UTF-8, Unix, etc.) https://fasterthanli.me - Faster than Lime: Amos's blog leaning heavily towards Rust. I'm a beginner in Rust, but I love this guy's style of writing even when the stuff he's writing about is beyond my current skill level. Anyway, those are my go-tos at the moment. I look forward to trying a bunch of the others recommended here. Oh and I currently use Feeder under Android as my RSS reader; it's unexciting, which is what I look for in an app these days :D A last recommendation - as part of trying to avoid doom-scrolling, I have a paper subscription to The Economist and I'm trying to train myself to read that instead of going to news sites. The lack of immediacy helps keep the emotional reaction in check (it's not as addictive of course). reply",

          "text": "My running joke after showing off some amazing LLM-driven work is... if you think this is impressive, I once opened a modal dialog on an Apple IIGS in 65C816 assembly I don't think you need to learn BASIC, if you know concepts like conditionals and looping and indexing.  It is interesting to compare the higher-level language of the time with its companion assembly.  And you might find yourself writing BASIC programs to complement your assembly, if you stick to that platform. <lore>\nA friend dropped me a BASIC program that ran and wrote text to the Apple IIGS border.  He asked me to figure it out, because it wasn't obvious what was going on.  OG hacker puzzle... it was a BASIC program that jumped to hidden assembly after the apparent end of the text file (hidden chars maybe, I forget) and the assembly was changing the border at appropriate rate to \"draw\" on it.   Those were the days... trying to find some reference to this and am failing.\n</lore> I certainly credit my stack-frame debugging capability to dealing with that stuff so long ago.  Oddly enough, I didn't really find it helpful for computer architecture class.  Just because you know registers exists and how to manipulate them, doesn't exactly map architecting modern hardware system.  But being fluent in logic operations and bit-twiddling and indexing does help a lot. reply",

Also, don't forget the HUGE number of resources for 6502 assembly programming that are available in the https://archive.org/ magazine and book sections: https://archive.org/search?query=6502 Rodney Zaks' books are great - I like especially \"6502 Games\", which taught me a lot back in the day: https://archive.org/download/6502g/6502Games.pdf I'm also especially fond of the easy6502 emulator - its a very handy tool to have while studying 6502 techniques: https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/ Its not absolutely necessary to learn BASIC before Assembly, but it will definitely help you understand the resources of the machine better if you can debug BASIC ROM code.  My personal 6502 platform of choice, the Oric-1/Atmos machines, has a pretty great ROM disassembly available, from which a lot of great knowledge can be obtained - but it does of course first require an undersanding of BASIC. In case you're curious, the Oric-1 ROM Disassembly: https://library.defence-force.org/books/content/oric_advance...

But HN is full of 6502 enthusiasts, so I approve of tapping their collective wisdom to discover personal favorites and recommendations. Unlike modern computers, 8-bit systems were expected to be programmed by their owners! As a result there are many books from the 8-bit, pre-internet era explaining exactly how to do so, and many of those books are conveniently available on the modern internet (perhaps via a google or other search, or on archive.org, etc.) Many systems also came with user instruction manuals explaining how to program them. Here is the Apple II BASIC manual from 1978: https://archive.org/details/Apple_II_Basic_Programming_Manua... Note how it explains everything from scratch, including how to hook the Apple II up to a TV, how to use the keyboard, and how to start up BASIC. BASIC was designed as a simple but effective programming language that could be learned by computing novices (first year college students) in an afternoon. Here is the original Dartmouth BASIC manual (23 pages long!) from 1964: https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basicmanual_1964.pdf reply",

          "text": "Definitely develop some capabilities to accomplish an elementary satisfying project in BASIC. It's the language that was designed for you to learn about programming and a computer language at the same time. Whether or not you actually \"master\" the language or just barely learn a few commands, before using a few commands to make a simple finished program.  One approach would surely be a lot faster than the other ;) After that then decide how much you learned about programming itself from the little project, then you can see how far that BASIC alone may be able to advance your programming abilities even after you may be very familiar with the language in detail, or not. In that '80's generation of home computers with a 6502, most had built-in BASIC so a common progression for so many was to learn BASIC at the same time as learn programming, since nobody had ever had home computers before.  This could be just fine for business applications.  Assembly is not nearly as easy as BASIC to learn, but in some sense programming is programming. Then for gaming BASIC was not nearly as fast as assembly but often BASIC performed just fine anyway for developing the logical game flow and making it a \"fun\" game at its core to begin with.  The problem with BASIC was all the other little details like video, I/O, UI, HID, were all so dramatically slower because each BASIC command needed to be interpreted before it could be run on the hardware and that took a little extra time in between each command but it really added up when you have challenging hardware interfaces and not simply fundamental game logic (many times game logic can be so simple that it's never slow in any language). For a plain BASIC game that is \"complete\" but is supposed to have quick action and low latency, the next step in the learning curve would then be to find out which part of the BASIC code is the main resource bottleneck when it comes to processing time, then replace that one function with an equivalent written in assembly.  It was accepted that it was a lot more work then to introduce assembly to make the game do the same thing it was before, only quicker. It may not be very clear looking back, but there were a number of good reference books and instructional approaches and so much of it was intertwined with \"learn BASIC + programming at the same time\" followed by \"useful assembly language techniques\" to speed up your programs. As crowds moved along these lines together to a degree as they emerged, it might help to look at publication dates for the books of the time, and use what's found in the earlier texts to help you with later concepts. reply",

They're a more or less faithful remake of the Commodore 64 but have an HDMI port, SD card instead of disk drive, etc. You could learn BASIC, should be able move to assembly as well—a quick search pulled up a YouTube course on 6502 assembly for the Commodore [2].

If you only have experience programming in modern languages (Javascript, etc.), learning the Applesoft BASIC will also be super helpful before you learn 6502, as you'll learn how to get by without ... A) the following language conveniences: - function names (it's all line numbers), - variables with more than 2 letters, and B) the following modern concepts: - function calls (no stack other than for GOSUB, use subroutines with dedicated variables for passing parameters instead), - scoped variables (everything is global), - dynamic allocation (you have to DIM arrays with the max size upfront), - anything object-like like structs or classes (hack it with multi-dimensional arrays) - other fancy stuff like callbacks, promises, hashtables and any other data structure beyond arrays. and that will nicely prepare you for 6502 assembly (or any kind of assembly really). The advantage in 6502 assembly is you can implement most of B) yourself if you do need it. reply",

You can just call the ROM routines which has the nice side effect of working with 40- or 80-columns automatically. If you are doing hires graphics you are going to use a lookup table regardless as doing the multiplication to get the base address of a particular scanline is far too slow. You can, one time, either make a table manually, which you can use forever, or you can write a short routine that counts from 0 to 191, stick 0 in X and the scanline number in A and JSR $F411. It'll leave the base address of the scanline in $36 and $37. Which you can stick in your table. As in other comments, if you are specifically interested in the Apple II line, the Assembly Lines books by Roger Wagner is fantastic. Also, if you can find it Sandy Mossberg's Disassembly Lines articles in Nibble magazine were great too. Start with Assembly Lines, then read the Disassembly Lines and you'll be quite expert. reply",

          "text": "Starting with Assembly is simply a bad idea because the tooling is terrible, and the learning curve of the tooling is steep. Filled with arcane codes and abbreviations and workflow right out the gate. Programming concepts are pretty much universal. Being distanced from computer architecture is not a limitation for novice programmers, Python et al succeeds for a reason. If you're determined to start with assembly, then I hope you can find someone to help you get started with all the machinations necessary to get from LDA #0 to A9 00 with as little drama as possible. Someone to show you how to use the assembler, what the directives mean, the linker, a symbolic debugger (if you're lucky). Someone to provide you with a .DUMPREG \"START OF SORT\" and .DUMPMEM BUFF $80 \"AFTER INPUT\" macros that you can liberally scatter throughout your code so you actually progress and get some insight into what the heck you code is doing. Perhaps some way to stop your programs that doesn't include hitting the reset button on the machine. I mention that because, again, the tooling is terrible. All of the is easier said than done. None of the assembly books address this, none of the assembly program reference guides do either. Assembly is VERY black box. It's a large step up to even get started. It's much easier to \"learn programming\" first at a higher level, where you can quickly progress and succeed, before turning into the dark hole that is assembly, particularly on older machines. At least on a KIM-1 you can hit the STOP button and cursor through memory (being conscious that the memory architecture of the KIM is quite funky), something that simple is quite difficult on an Apple ][. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am asking this question for my personal circumstances --- not a general statement about software engineering.<p>I am a CompSci senior focusing on ML. My university does not have applied research in ML, so doing ML in school (classes/research) is pretty much a one-way ticket to the theory/algorithms side of academia.<p>Last year, I had the epiphany that I am good at (and enjoy) solving problems by connecting components in a system instead of finagling a problem into a form where we can apply some mathematical law. Specifically, I have greatly enjoyed working with artists/UI/UX/frontend/non-tech people as their back-end counterpart. I have built data pipelines for MLEs, back-end for UI/UX/frontend designers, machine learning pipeline for BME researchers and projection/imagery software for artists.<p>I am pretty generalist and tool-agnostic, with more breadth than depth. That feels like software engineering.<p>That said, I do like to have an understanding of how things work and I have a decent tolerance for reading math. This is a really nerdy thing to say but I enjoyed deriving stuff like the convergence of gradient descent and I enjoyed real analysis. I also really enjoyed Nand2Tetris (open source course teaching you to build a minimal computer from NAND gates + compiler from OOP language to binary). It's extremely elegant to me, seeing the great design choices people made in the past. I feel like these are underappreciated in software engineering.<p>Right now, I have an opportunity to work with my RL professor, who has an amazing track record publishing at top conferences. I am really on the fence because his research is in RL algorithms and I had a very bad experience in my last algorithm research project somewhere else (I had a vague idea of what we were doing but nowhere near enough to make contributions). I am concurrently applying to jobs and Master's and I am pretty sure I will never touch this topic again if I go into industry after graduation.<p>I have these two questions:\n1) Do I sound like the software engineers you know? What other roles do you think I am a good fit for?\n2) Should I take this opportunity simply for research exposure? Do you think this is necessary in helping me keep up with trends as an applied practitioner in ML?<p>P.S. This is my first time posting on HN and this seems a lot longer than the average Ask HN post. I don't know if that's appropriate. Please lmk if I should go to a subreddit instead.<p>Thanks in advance if you read all that!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Of course the CPU side usually lacks semantics to automatically create data visualizations (while modern 3D APIs have enough context to figure out data dependencies and data formats), and that would be the \"interesting\" part to solve - e.g. how to tunnel richer debug information from the programming language to the debugger. Also there's a middle ground of directly adding a realtime runtime debugging UI to applications via something like Dear Imgui ( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/ ) which is at least extremely popular in game development - and in this case it's trivial to provide the additional context since you basically develop the debugging system alongside the application. PS: I'd also like a timeslider that \"just works\", e.g. travelling back to a previous state, taking snapshots and exploring different \"state forks\". And of course while at it, live editing / hot code reloading, so that there is no difference between development and debugging session, both merge into the same workflow. reply",

          "text": "I'm not too offended by this answer. We all reach for it before we seriously think about the debugger. But debugging should be treated as a specialist skill that's almost as complex as programming, and just as empowering. There are two ways I can think of right away, in which the mastery of debuggers can enrich us. The first is that it gives you an unparalleled insight into the real stuff behind the scenes. You'll never stop learning new things about the machine with a debugger. But at the minimum, it will make you a much better programmer. With the newly found context, those convoluted pesky programming guidelines will finally start to make sense. The second is that print is an option only for a program you have the source code for. A debugger gives you observability and even control over practically any program, even one already in flight or one that's on a different machine altogether. Granted, it's hard to debug a binary program. But in most cases on Linux or BSD, that's only because the source code and the debugging symbols are too large to ship with the software. Most distros and BSDs actually make them available on demand using the debuginfod software. It's a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wishes to tinker with it. But even without it, Linux gamers are known to ship coredumps to the developers when games crash. Debugging is the doorway to an entirely different world. reply",

          "text": "I've recently been thinking how AI agents could affect this. If you're lucky enough to be able to code significant amounts with a modern agent (someone's paying, your task is amenable to it, etc) then you may experience development shifting (further) from \"type in the code\" to \"express the concepts\".  Maybe you still write some code - but not as much. What does this look like for debugging / understanding?  There's a potential outcome of \"AI just solves all the bugs\" but I think it's reasonable to imagine that AI will be a (preferably helpful!) partner to a human developer who needs to debug. My best guess is: * The entities you manage are \"investigations\" (mapping onto agents)\n * You interact primarily through some kind of rich chat (includes sensibly formatted code, data, etc)\n * The primary artefact(s) of this workflow are not code but something more like \"clues\" / \"evidence\". Managing all the theories and snippets of evidence is already core to debugging the old fashioned way.  I think having agents in the loop gives us an opportunity to make that explicit part of the process (and then be able to assign agents to follow up gaps in the evidence, or investigate them yourself or get someone else to...). reply",

It's definitely convoluted as it comes to memory obtained from the stack, but for heap allocations, a debugger could trace the returns of the allocator APIs, use that as a beginning point of some data's lifetime, and then trace any access to that address, and then gather the high-level info on the address of the reader/writer. Global variables should also be trivial (fairly so) as you'll just need to track memory accesses to their address. (Of course, further work is required to actually apply this.) For variables on the stack, or registers, though, you'll possibly need heuristics which account for reusage of memory/variables, and maybe maintain a strong association with the thread this is happening in (for both the thread's allocated stack and the thread context), etc. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm at 160wpm with my apple keyboard [0]. It's easily my favourite keyboard of all time but I'd love an ergo keyboard with chiclet keys and a built in mouse. I was looking at the cybord imprint [1] and the kinese advantage 360 [2] but the kinesis despite its infinite good reviews doesn't have a mouse and is too expensive for me although it is wireless, same with the imprint. My goal is to ziptie it to my herman miller aeron armrests so I don't have to ever move my arms, and I can swing around to look at my other monitors without craning my neck. Any out of the box solutions I can order that don't need soldering and assembly? There seem to be few.<p>[0] https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/mxk83ll/a/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-and-numeric-keypad-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb%E2%80%91c-us-english-black-keys  \n[1] https://cyboard.digital/products/imprint\n[2] https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/</p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Secrets management with Agents feels absent today. The agent needs API keys to call external services, but the usual patterns feel broken in this context. You see this clearly when writing Agent Skills.<p>Environment variables: The agent has shell access. It can run `env` or `echo $API_KEY` and access the secret, either through prompt injection or just by exploring or debugging.<p>.env files: Same problem. The agent can `cat .env`. The file is right there on the filesystem waiting for curious `print()` statements.<p>Proxy process / wrapper: You can stand up a separate process that holds the secret and proxies requests. The agent calls localhost, never sees the key. This works, but it's a lot of operational overhead. Now you're running infrastructure just to hide a string from your own tools. It also feels close to reinventing MCP.<p>What I've been experimenting with:<p>1. OS keychain with credential helper: The bundled or generated script calls out to the system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, etc.) at runtime. The agent can invoke the script, but can't directly query the keychain. Libraries like Python's `keyring` abstract over OS keychains and make it somewhat portable, but this all assumes certain runtime environments and requires user interaction via the OS.<p>2. Credential command escape hatch: Scripts accept a `--credential-cmd` flag that runs an arbitrary shell command to fetch the secret (`pass show`, `op read`, `vault kv get`, etc.). Flexible, but the agent could potentially inspect what command is being run and iterate to try to access it anyway.<p>Neither of these feel like a real solution. An agent could probe for credentials.<p>How are others handling secrets in agent workflows? Is anyone building agent runtimes with proper secrets isolation? Seems like something the official agent harnesses need to figure out and ship with.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi HN,<p>I’m working on AI agents used for software development. These agents automatically spin up short-lived app instances – for example per pull request, per task, or per experiment – each with its own temporary URL.<p>Auth is handled in the standard way:<p>- OAuth2 / OIDC<p>- external identity provider<p>- redirect URLs must be registered in advance and be static<p>This clashes badly with short-lived apps:<p>- URLs are dynamic and unpredictable<p>- redirect URLs can’t realistically be pre-registered<p>- auth becomes the only non-ephemeral part of an otherwise fully automated workflow<p>What I see teams doing instead:<p>- disabling real auth in preview environments<p>- routing all callbacks through a single stable environment<p>- using wildcard redirects or proxy setups that feel like hacks<p>This gets especially awkward for AI dev agents, because they assume infrastructure is disposable and fully automated – no manual IdP config in the loop.<p>So I’m curious:<p>1. If you use short-lived preview apps, how do you handle real auth?<p>2. Are there clean OAuth/OIDC patterns that work with dynamic URLs?<p>3. Is the static redirect URL assumption still the right model here?<p>4. What actually works in production?<p>Looking for real setups and failure stories, not theory.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I still haven't found an Android app or website that can do everything that I need (basic functionality), but in general: - I need physical buttons. I often find that on touchscreens I mistype something and I don't notice. - The history feature. Maybe I want to do a serial task or calculation, and I can just replace/correct one of the formulas in the history and it automatically recalculates all of the expressions that came after it. - I have written some micropython code / utilities for the calculator and I use it all the time. - I don't want to context switch to do a quick calculation. On my PC I have to open up a new terminal or a website (I might be offline, so I have to hotspot and then connect the wifi and ...) and interrupt my existing work or I have to frequently switch between a PDF or latex or whatever that I'm working on. - Typing out `sin` or `np.sin` or `sin^-1` on PC is both longer and more error prone. It gets very frustrating very quickly. - The numerical solver is a godsend. Try solving for the roots of an expression like `xe^x = 10` on your PC without internet. Or with an android application. On my calculator it's just a few dedicated button presses. On the PC, I have to use isympy and typeout `nsolve(Eq(x * exp(x), 10), 1)`, and you wouldn't even get a proper graphical display of the expression while you are typing it. reply",

If I'm solving a problem of any complexity I'll move to a more appropriate tool like python or a spreadsheet, but for the simple math that needs to be done around the edges personally and professionally, I like a calculator.

It has no graphing capability and it's barely programmable, but that's ok, I keep an actual computer nearby for those sorts of things. The calculator keeps earning new batteries bc tinkering with analog circuits I frequently want to evaluate little things like AB/(A+B) or 1/2piF or (1+S)/(1-S), or need the log 10 or square root or the cosine of something. In those circumstances, the calculator's compact form factor is quite convenient, compared to needing two hands at the computer keyboard, or one handedly hunt-pecking said keyboard. As for the mouse, that has to be the slowest, most focus stealing option of them all. The calculator doesn't take much room, so it can be kept within arm's reach without getting in the way, quickly gives me the numbers I need, without demanding I become fully engaged with it. Also, those old HP buttons are just so nice to press, a refreshing break from the dead flat glass you get everywhere else these days. reply",

          "text": "For over a decade I've been using emulators of the calculators I grew up using on all my android phones. I see no point in changing my \"weird\" ways. I use RealCalc for most things (RPN style). Has many functions like a scientific, but I mostly stick to the basic four and it also converts units. I switch to Graph89 when I need a graph/table involving trig or polynomial approximations. Sometimes I'll even write a basic program. If I'm using this app I probably also have measuring tools out for a DIY project. I go to spreadsheets for anything beyond that using \"Office: Planmaker\". It handles the xlsx format perfectly! That's how I do my monthly budget, health tracking, etc. For reasons beyond my understanding, some people are still impressed seeing proper full-featured spreadsheets done quickly on a phone. reply",

I remember being able to hear** either the processor clock or data line(s) of each of the 32 and 48 because one or more components acted as inadvertent audio oscillators that would make noises during computation (and during idle on the 48 because it had to keep redrawing the clock). I've used R, MATLAB, pspice, and Mathematica in the past. I'm a fan of Xcas and Wolfram Alpha now. * I also have a collection of HP 48[GS]X cards, the printer, and the overhead projector adapter. In lieu of the overpriced official HP 48G to computer RS-232 interface cable, one can be easily made from a Sony CD-ROM audio cable. ** With my much younger ear pressed up to it. reply",

          "text": "Same here. I like tinkering with my Home Assistant setup and small web server running miscellaneous projects on my Raspberry Pi, but I hate having to debug it from my phone when it all falls over while I'm not near my computer. Being able to chat with somebody that has a working understanding of a Unix environment and can execute tasks like \"figure out why Caddy is crash looping and propose solutions\" for a few dollars per month is a dream come true. I'm not actually using OpenClaw for that just yet, though; something about exposing my full Unix environment to OpenAI or Anthropic just seems wrong, both in terms of privacy and dependency. The former could probably be solved with some redacting and permission-enforcing filter between the agent and the OS, but the latter needs powerful local models. (I'll only allow my Unix devops skills to start getting rusty once I can run an Opus 4.5 equivalent agent on sub-$5000 hardware :) reply",

Before the spike in prices you could just about build such a system for $2500, but the ram along probably adds another $2k onto that now. Nvidia dgx boxes and similar setups with 256gb unified ram can probably manage it more slowly ~1-2 tokens per second. Unsloth has the quantized models. I’ve test Kimi though don’t have quite the headroom at home for it, and I don’t yet see a significant enough difference between it and the Qwen 3 models that can run in more modest setups: I get a highly usable 50 tokens per second out of the A3B instruct that fits into 16gb VRAM with enough left over not to choke Netflix and other browser tasks, it performs on par with what I ask out of Haiku in Claude Code, and better as my own tweaking improves with the also ever better tooling that comes out near weekly. reply",

Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing? Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents. Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances. This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch. This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale. This is AWESOME. reply",

          "text": "I spec out everything in excruciating detail with spec docs. Then I actually read them. Finally, we create granular tasks called \"beads\" (see https://github.com/steveyegge/beads ). The beads allows us to create epics/tasks/subtasks and associated dependency structure down to a granular bead, and then the agents pull a \"bead\" to implement. So, mostly we're either creating spec docs and creating beads or implementing, quality checking, and testing the code created from an agent implementing a bead. I can say this produces better code than I could write after 10yrs of focused daily coding myself. However, I don't think \"vibe coders\" that have never truly learned to code, have any realistic chance of creating decent code in a large complex code base that requires a complex backend schema to be built. They can only build relatively trivial apps. But, I do believe what I am building is as solid as if I had a millions of dollars of staff doing it with me. reply",

If it's already a mess with leaking abstractions and architecture that doesn't actually enforce any design, then it feels unlikely you'll be able to stack anything on top of below it to actually fix that. And then you end up with some spaghetti that the agent takes longer and longer to edit as things get more and more messy. reply",

          "text": "Here is my view after putting in my 10,000+ hours learning to code pre-llm days, while also building a pretty complex design + contract manufacturing company, with a lot of processes in place for that to happen. If you have a bunch of human junior devs and even a senior dev or two that join your org to help you build an app, and you don't have any dev/ops structure in place for them, then you will end up with \"spaghetti\" throughout all your code/systems, from those relatively bright humans. Its the same managing agents. It cannot be expected to build a complex system from simple \"one shot me a <x> feature\" from a bunch of different agents, each with a finite ~150k token context limit. It must be done in context of the system you have in place. If you have a poor/no system structure, you'll end up with garbage for code. Everything that I said I had to guide the agents, is also useful for human devs. I'm sure that all the FANGS and various advanced software companies also use custom linters, etc., for every code check in. It's just now become easier to have these advanced code quality structures in place, and it is absolutely necessary when managing/coordinating agents to build a complex application. reply",

The trick isn't \"how to manage spaghetti\" with LLMs (nor humans), because the context gets all wired up, but how to avoid it from first place. You can definitely do \"one-shot\" over and over again with a small context and build something complex, as long as you take great care about what goes into the context, more isn't better. Anyways, feels like we have pretty opposite perspectives, I'm glad we're multiple people attacking similar problems but from seemingly pretty different angles, helps to find the best solutions.

This is the first thing that's clicked. I just chat with it and it figures out what to file where. Everything's just .md files underneath, so I can grep it, git it, whatever. No lock-in.\nThe stuff I'm actually finding useful: it sends me news digests on topics I care about a few times a day, and pings me with reminders via Telegram. Simple stuff, but it works. Could I build this with Claude Code and some glue? Sure. But this was basically working out of the box.\nCaveats: it chews through tokens fast, and I keep it completely cut off from anything sensitive—no email, no messages, nothing financial.

          "text": "I'm running it on an old MacBook that I wiped a few months ago and had lying around. I tried installing it on an old raspberry pi first, but it was super slow and the skills ecosystem wants to use brew which doesn't work so well on the pi. First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. Obviously it's not as revolutionary as people are hyping it up to be, but it's a step in the right direction. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own. I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. But it still fills up its context pretty quickly, so you see diminishing returns. I was a skeptic until I actually installed it and messed around with it. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant. I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be.  I like the local files first mentality.  It makes me excited for a time when running local models becomes easier. I should add that it's very buggy.  It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through. reply",

          "text": "I've been using it for the past couple days. Like most AI products right now, it is both incredible and incredibly stupid. Virtually everything I've tried (starting with just getting it running) was broken in some way. Most of those things I was able to use an LLM to resolve, which is cool, but also why doesn't it just work to begin with? I still haven't gotten it to successfully create a cron job. Also messages keep getting lost between the web GUI and discord. Trying to enable the matrix integration broke the whole thing. It seems to be able to recall past sessions, but only sometimes. I've been using OpenCode with various models, often times running several instances in tmux that I can connect to and switch between over ssh. It feels like the hype around openclaw is mostly from bringing the multi-instance agentic experience to non-developers, and providing some nice hooks to integrate with email, twitter, etc. But given that I have a nice setup running opencode in little firejail-isolated containers, I'll probably drop openclaw. Way too janky, and I can't get over the thought of \"if this is so amazing, why doesn't it work?\" reply",

Disagreements over what is hype and what is not are missing this. Model capability value is attenuated/magnified across multiple orders of magnitude, by the varying creativity, ability, and resources of its users. • There will be few insignificant developments related to AI autonomy. \"Small\" or \"novelty\" steps are happening quickly. Any scale ups of agent identity continuity, self-management, agent-to-agent socialization or agent-reality interactions, are not trivial events. • AI autonomy can't be stopped. We are seeing meaningful evidence that decentralized human curiosity and the competitive need to increase personal effectiveness, combined with democratized access to AI, is likely to drive model freedom forward in an uncontrolled manner. (Not an argument for centralization. Decentralization creates organic incentives to find alignment. Centralization, the opposite.) reply",

Domain should  never depend on infrastructure or application layer and so on. But the projects I got have domain that depend on infrastructure and another one where application has a reference directly to infrastructure and been told that this is correct implementation... doh..<p>I think I was kind of a good at listening for the lectures, but I now am doubting about, whether it was worth learning stuff at all lol since it's so controversial out there. I am, of course, in no position to question senior dev, but what do you guys think - is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go straight to the trash bin or am I just misunderstanding the real-work-like context?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "1. also helps you after the first 3-6 months. As in, you can't change the entire code base (if reasonably large). Not even with AI helping you with the tedious bits. Consistency is something that does have value, even if it's not global and even if the consistent thing is not how you would've done/called it. The more consistency you can get, the better, because it helps tremendously. Both you and also an AI. If things are named consistently it doesn't matter whether you call a potato a potato or a potahto. It just matters that you don't call it an orange half the time. We have a relatively good code base in this regard for example. To find things, I literally just hit the shortcut to open file/class by name, start typing the camel case for what I need and I'm usually there. Like, if I need to know what exactly we do for writing the potahto to the database, I type PoRep and I'll probably see the PotatoRepositoryImpl and I'm where I need to be. Of course not everything is roses. I might want to know what the service layer for the potahto does and start typing PotSer and I find nothing, because half the domain objects call the service layer a service and the other half calls it manager . That's OK. That's called \"local consistency\" and it happens as a code base grows and ages and different people with different opinions build in it and don't know enough about the magic of consistency and think they know better but can't or don't want to change the existing code base. As long as it doesn't get out of hand, it's not a big deal and you can slowly converge. 2. This is such a big one, thank you! Too many people don't believe in Chesterton's fence. They know so much better! Rewrite everything! And it is OK and good to question why the fence is there! Nothing is worse than \"we do it this way because we've always done it that way!\". But also, if you never question the fence's existence, you're stuck forever. This is an anecdote I found very good in this regard. A group of scientists places five monkeys in a room with a ladder and a banana on top. When one monkey tries to reach the banana, all are sprayed with cold water. Eventually, all of them stop attempting to climb. The scientists then place a new monkey who knows nothing of the water incident. When the new monkey sees the banana and tries to climb, the others prevent them from reaching it. Nobody gets sprayed any longer. The scientists slowly replace any of the original monkeys that were actually sprayed with water with new ones. Eventually there are no monkeys left that experienced the spraying. Yet no monkey ever even tries to get the banana any more. So, do challenge Chesterston's fence's existence! Try to find one of the monkeys that actually got sprayed with water, so that you may understand why the fence was there. Or in other words ask the other monkeys why the eff you can't go for the banana. And if nobody can tell you other than \"coz we've never done it like that\", then try it. For all you know, the pesky scientist with the hose is long gone! reply",

Some minor points: - What you learned in college was not a waste. - When it comes to software development, everything is controversial to someone . And ever-changing. - You need to spend a good 12-18 months acquiring situational awareness. It's pretty common in life to attain a level and discover you \"know nothing\" and have it feel like you're starting over from scratch. It's just an illusion, but it's also kind of true. Eg. You get your blue belt in Brazilian Jui Jujitsu, and realize there's a whole other Jedi level you weren't aware of. - Regardless, trust in your abilities, master the fundamentals, listen to mentors, and ride the wave. - The progress graph is not a flat line upwards. There's peaks and valleys, but as long as it trends up, you're doing good. reply",

This can be a healthy relationship as the real world has constraints on your time. You learn to make trade offs as you go, even if they are wrong.

But as you really learn and become more of a chef, these are just skill sets and experiences you pull on to make the right thing in the right moment.

          "text": "Quick answer: the code tends to mirror the way the project is run. Read on if you want my elaboration and advice. The good thing about being a junior dev is that your decisions don't have much impact yet and nobody trusts you anyway. The bad thing is that people trust experience way too much and will eventually start to dump more work on you and not question you. That's when the real struggle begins. This struggle doesn't stop until you retire. It's the precious nature of limited time and attention. Other people's struggles have produced the strange code you're looking at right now. Your gut is right. Don't trust that code, but also know that your time is limited and you need to stay focused on your assigned tasks. Stay curious and take mental note, but never make a move until you know you can without consequence. You have other stuff to do. Eventually bugs will be found or new features will be assigned to you. Only then do you have sufficient information to act. The description of the bug or feature tells you more than the code ever did. Code just tells you how. Bugs and requirements will tell you what it does and why. So now here's my advice. Teamwork is hard work and people can develop antisocial behavior that causes dysfunction and ultimately bad code. Nobody ever truly has the full picture or full authority. Don't trust anyone who claims to regardless of titles or years of experience. On the opposite end, some people seek solitary refuge in their work but doing the same will hold you back too. Avoid staying siloed amongst the devs, and run from the places that force you to. Don't buy into hype and always do the minimum that works. Good code is less code, but expect to write more. Your education is valuable, and your eyes don't deceive you. Don't let people get to you and it will be fine. reply",

I’d suggest you maintain your knowledge and build upon it for how to build systems that scale both organizationally and from a performance pov. That way, you can identify which parts can be made better in the existing system without breaking it. Ultimately, the customer really doesn’t care about the internals as long as whatever they’re using solves their immediate problem. They hold the ultimate card because they will just switch to another service provider if they’re cheaper, even if their product is worse. So don’t become jaded. Become an expert in systems engineering and work on making things better. When you have a chance to work on a green field project, apply your knowledge there and make a foundation that will outlast your commits. But realize that the business might toss your perfect shiny approach into the bin if it doesn’t translate into $. Don’t take it personally. Optimize for the best solution given the $ and time constraints. For example, adding better test coverage might help reduce issues that result in headaches and lost productivity, or worse down times. Or adding a better interface to a poorly written implementation so you’re not tossing out everything just reducing the surface area for problems. Good luck!

I have been in corporate software for nearly 20 years.  During my time there have been three completely unrelated paths: career elevation, technical brilliance, and finally seeking employment.  I cannot say if this will hold true into the future, but it has been true for a long time. First, know what you want and that will tell you who to follow.  So, let's talk about this. If you want to ascend in your career you need to focus on mastery of only two things: soft skills and conscientiousness (awareness).  Career elevation ultimately means some combination of management people and/or projects.  You actually have to care about the people you are managing or you can be a complete dick if you are an outsider who knows the right people at the proper levels.  You also need to be masterful at management of multiple work streams, calendars, and event timelines impacting multiple teams.  Imagine being in three unrelated conversations simultaneously all day long and still knowing the technical details about what is happening better than the people on each of those multiple chats/calls without exhaustion. Technical brilliance comes from building ambitious things.  If you aren't constantly building new and ever more challenging things at work then you need to be doing it outside of work.  This typically has a negative impact on career progression unless you are willing to get a PhD and make a career out of research like Roy Fielding.  It has a negative impact on career progression because demands a tremendous amount of time practicing on things that are not directly tied to the key goals of your employer's business goals. Then finally there are people whose only goal is seeking employment or raises from jumping between employers.  This is counter productive to both career elevation and technical skill growth, but can be good if you are a future founder and are trying to build out personal relationships.  I have always thought of these people as trend followers and bottom feeders from a technical skill perspective. reply",

Many times you might think something is stupid, and the person telling you about it probably thinks it's stupid too, but it's what needs to happen to keep things working without upending the whole company. The person you can both yell at about it is probably retired or dead, and likely made the right decision at the time, given what they were working with at the time.

          "text": "So different colleges have different courses, and focus on different things. So what I say next is very much YMMV. Back when I did college there was a disconnect between what students thought college was for, and what colleges thought college was for. This was ultimately addressed in 2nd year, but it took me decades to really understand it. As students we went to college thinking we were being taught skills to prepare us for getting jobs. Which given the endless \"you need to go to college to get a decent job\" mantra seems reasonable. My college however believed that job skills are basically easily assimilated and can be quickly learned after you get the job. What makes it possible to learn fast are solid foundational skills and understandings. For example a chef is better off learning the science of food, and honing knife skills. Once hired they can learn French recipes or Italian recipes or whatever. In our case the complaint was about language; we learned in C and C++, with forays into assembler and Scheme. Job postings were for Cobol and Java (this was the 90s). To show us language was irrelevant we did 10 assignments in 10 days. The same problem 10 times over, but in a different language every day. And this is pre www, so harder than it would be now. But still, turns out, really easy. Now sure, good theory doesn't always make it into the real world in a perfect state. But I continue to be amazed at how much the fundamentals matter. 35 years later and I still ground my work in solid theory. And I notice a lot those around MD who are lacking that theory. So, I'd say yes, lean into the theory. Yes the real world is messy, but knowing best practices, and encouraging their use always pays off in the long term. I'll counterpoint that though that juniors always want huge sweeping changes to make it conform to their newly minted theory. Don't be that guy. It's OK to spend some time first getting to know your work system. Then you can enquire about past decisions made, and choices made. Then suggest small (and later larger) improvements.

(universe does not obey \"laws\" of physics. \"laws\" of physics describe universe) Software is knowledge medium. (kind-a self-) executable one. fast-changeable.\nSo far it needs people to (self-)change. So it is also a communication medium.. between people in space/time.. with all the trickery it entails.\nAnd ever since it existed, progressively more levels of it are generated by machines. But it's people who cause anything. you think this all sound too philosophical? you're right, because it is. Philosophy is the most base science there is.. yeah, and beware of the possible mild shizophreny when trying to be n concepts /persons at the same time. Might be difficult to explain to others. but do not be afraid. \nand. last but not least :).. have fun p.s. see me site for more on these topics reply",

          "text": "The college knowledge isn't wasted - you just need to reframe how you use it. Best practices like clean architecture exist to solve specific problems: making code easier to test, change, and reason about at scale. The key insight is understanding which problems they solve and when those problems actually matter. A domain layer that depends on infrastructure might be \"wrong\" by the textbook, but if it's a small internal tool with 3 users and a 2-year expected lifespan, the coupling probably doesn't matter. The cost of the \"correct\" abstraction exceeds the benefit. What I'd suggest: when you see code that violates a pattern you learned, ask yourself \"what problem would the 'correct' approach solve here, and does that problem actually exist in this context?\" Sometimes the answer is \"yes, and this code will bite us later.\" Often it's \"no, the simpler approach is fine for this use case.\" The ability to make that judgment - knowing when to apply rigor and when simplicity wins - is what separates effective senior devs from people who cargo-cult patterns regardless of context. reply",

          "text": "Yep, just like learning anything the intro level summaries don't reflect reality they just help you get your head around new things. In the real work experience every project, team, and company are a little bit unique in how they respond to the requirements and politics of the moment. Everyone is trying to get something done and how purely it follows some pattern or rule is only relevant as far as it helps get the work done. What you learned wasnt useless - it was probably very helpful for understanding or at least getting exposed to lots of concepts that you'll need. However, just like the joke about physicists and their spherical cows, the perfect algorithms and architecture rules from school aren't even close to the whole story in the trenches. A non-engineering anecdote - had a math professor tasked with determining a fit line for and integration of a bunch of sensor data (needed the total area under the curve, classic math test problem). College me imagined trying to craft bespoke integratable functions and maybe some multi part fitting optimization but I knew my little list of memorized formulas couldn't touch this real life data so I was looking forward to the veteran approach. Math guy printed it, eyeballed to fill in the gaps with a pen, cut it out, and weighed it against a sample of \"1x1\" unit squares of the paper. I was flabbergasted but the dude was so obviously right -- one off task, collected data with no clear pattern, didn't need crazy precision. The \"obvious\" answer took far less time than anything I had in mind and was plenty good enough for the problem at hand. tl;dr - what you learned so far wasn't wasted it was simply the very beginning of filling up your mental toolbox reply",

This is so interesting, we were never taught about any of these things. I think there was one course titled \"software engineering\" (as part of a 4-year degree) that may have mentioned something similar at one point. But that's about it. Which country did you study in? It's quite fascinating to me as it's such a surprise that there are places where these kind of \"design patterns\" are a core part of the degree. > is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go Most of them yes, because for most of them the answer is \"it depends\". And if we're going to be technical (and come on, this is computing so we should be) - then really the answer is \"it depends\" for every single one of them. There is not a single design pattern that applies to all coding domains. Not even \"always give your variables descriptive names\", and that's probably the one with the highest % of coverage. reply",

I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk?

(pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention\n\n  noisy suggestions / interruption\n\n  hallucinations / wrong suggestions\n\n  workflow change / migration cost\n\n  pricing\n\n  others</code></pre></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It commits to memory, not to action. I really don't care about having a whole searchable, tagged database; I hardly ever look at those notes again. At work I have topic-based Markdown notes. Sometimes I collect information about a topic for a few weeks or months, and eventually turn it into a proper guide (making guides is my job). I also LOVE paper notebooks, because they become a beautiful timeline of sketches, to-do lists, thoughts and plans. When I finish a notebook, I scan it then throw it in a drawer. I also use Obsidian daily notes to journal, mostly because it's easier to open an app than to write in a notebook. I don't do anything special with those notes, unless I'm trying to \"debug\" something happening in my life. [0] https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-... reply",

It seems you're more accustomed to treating stored information as memories rather than a knowledge base. That's perfectly fine.

For a lot of us, what we store is really a snapshot of attention, curiosity, anxiety, and identity at a moment in time — more like a personal log than a database. One framing that helps me is: the archive isn’t “truth”, it’s “evidence of what I cared about”, and it’s only useful when it reduces friction for a real moment (re-entry, reflection, or a concrete next step). Otherwise it’s just noise. Do you find it more useful as a mirror (patterns about yourself), or as a tool (helping you make decisions / take action)? reply",

In other cases it forces me to actually understand what I'm feeling in order to put it into words. In a sense those notes could be write-only and still be useful. In other cases these notes are a complement to my photos. They show a different aspect of my life at a given moment. My photos don't show that on September 4, 2015, I had a massive crush on someone. I have built a timeline that combines my journals, photos, sketches, geolocation, Google searches and other things. It reveals a far more nuanced picture of me at a given time. I also have more technical notes. Those are a bit of a \"collection of facts\". It's a bit like putting all the parts on the table, and slowly organising them into a coherent structure. This is how I approach bigger topics before I understand them fully. Then my notes act as a sort of medium-term memory. When I finish a project, I usually have a bunch of leftover notes and todos that I don't intend to ever finish. That's why I say that notes are not an obligation. reply",

One nuance: the way I’m thinking about this isn’t “you type a query and wait for an LLM”. It’s more like local indexing/pre-computation so retrieval is instant, and any heavier processing happens ahead of time (or during a scheduled review) so it never blocks you. Then you can consume it as a pull-based view or a tiny daily digest—no interruptions, no spinning cursor. If you could pick one: would you prefer a deterministic synonyms/alias layer (instant, fully controllable), or a local semantic index that improves recall but still feels “tool-like” rather than “AI”? I’m exploring a similar local-first, low-noise approach (more context in my HN profile/bio if you’re curious). reply",

Kind of in the same realm as ms recall but more focused on security/privacy with sensible cryptographic defaults where needed. It is basically a server/data store and client agents, currently the agent is only for linux end user devices. The agent records evdev events (keystrokes/mouse movement), currently active window, clipboard history, shell commands issued and browsing behaviour. It runs as its own user and different functionality is compartmentalized into their own processes. Data is encrypted at rest. I'm still looking into how to best handle sensitive data in-memory at runtime. It stores these events in a persistent queue on the clients and one-way syncs it to the server. If a client is offline for a bit it syncs it when it comes back online. As such, I am also trying to minimize storage used. The idea is that rather than overwhelmingly linking stuff manually, e.g. with obsidian, locality of reference seems more useful as a baseline. In this data set, links by time are valued the most. In the future I'd like to add also the screenshot/video feature using hashes and perceptual hashes or an RDP like way to store as little data as possible. For now I'm mostly in the architecting phase but I do have an early working version. Really looking for suggestions architecture wise too. So far I came up with my own binary format to save events on the clients but I'm unsure if it's the right way to go. There are many challenges to be thought about, such as changing hardware configuration (display plugged in), protecting against statistical analysis (e.g. keystroke bursts), deletion of data across sources if required, how to make sure the system can run smoothly for a decade, etc. reply",

          "text": "While I do hoard notes I've realized over the years that the main reason I write notes is as a memory aid.  If I write it down I remember it better, and I'm more likely to do it.  Notes also act as a filter because I write stuff down, sometimes review the notes later, and decide what I wrote down isn't worth doing, so making a note of an idea essentially gives me a delay to review the idea and decide if it is worth doing.  I do also record links, keeping them in wiki pages (along with wiki pages for notes about various projects); I started doing that because browser histories today seem to autodelete old links.  Putting them into a wiki makes them searchable.  I keep journals as well, which are also searchable.  I don't necessarily want to be reminded of my notes and wiki/journal entries, I know they are there, I mainly want to call them up when I decide I need them.  That's the main drawback of paper notes, I can't search them.  I've tried scanning them, but it's tedious and they don't translate to ASCII text well, and drawings are not searchable.  I've considered using one of the e-paper notepads instead of paper notes, but I'd need a notepad handy in every room of the house and that would cost too much, and the procedures to automatically sync them to a central location don't seem very reliable (and I don't want to sync personal notes to some public cloud). So for me, an AI that suggests stuff would be annoying.  An AI that could take some vague search terms and my history and could pull old information out of notes that don't necessarily have the keywords I enter, using the context provided by my history might be useful.  So for example, I may remember I happened across a design for the DSP algorithms in guitar pedals, but the URL or note may not even mention DSP, so something that could turn a search for \"guitar pedal DSP\" into finding a link for an audio processing web page I visited would be useful.  The AI would probably have to scan all the web pages I visit to be able to store enough context to be useful for a search like that.  Doing this for 20 years or more might run into some scalability/cost issues. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your feedback.\nThat makes sense — for many people notes are primarily a memory/idea-filter, not a task generator. Context, long-term memory, and storage issues are indeed challenges currently facing AI and large language models (LLMs), and they're not unique to the scenarios we're discussing. However, with technological advancements, I believe these issues will eventually be resolved. Based on your requirements, it seems you need to grant the AI sufficiently broad access and privacy permissions. That said, leveraging what you've already stored, achieving the fuzzy retrieval functionality you mentioned should be feasible. It's impressive that you can recall exactly where to find your notes! That said, active retrieval still requires you to remember what you're looking for. I think your fuzzy retrieval concept shares some similarities with what I'm aiming for—where the AI offers suggestions based on your intended actions, even when you haven't consciously decided what to search for. Wouldn't you welcome that kind of assistance? reply",

The key is using it to solve problems you actually have, rather than problems you want to have. I was losing track of people's contact details --> I made an addressbook in obsidian. I wanted to track my exercise to find out how much I was running each week --> make graphs And so on.  Your obsidian should get a bit messy before you try to impose order on it.  Use it to solve a problem badly (Just writing down how far I run in a daily diary note) then improve (Writing a query to turn all of those notes into a graph). Personally I don't use any AI with my knowledge base. Good searching tools and a little bit of organization are the most useful thing for me. Personally, I think keeping lots of notes/links is a kind of digital hoarding.  Just like real hoarding, it's an emotional problem not an organizational problem.  If you can work out what emotional need hoarding links is fulfilling for you then you're on the way to working out how to get that emotional need fulfilled by something else. reply",

Usually in that scenario, I actually will be in some mode where I'm trying take action.

Those are tied to actions I'm taking and I'll sprinkle them with actual to-do lists that I check off in the notes.

The problem is that I almost never come back to what I have saved. A simple example is YouTube. I save videos to watch later because I am not in the right headspace at the time. Then I avoid them completely. I think part of the resistance is that I know watching them properly will demand attention and probably lead to follow-up work, and I am rarely in a mode where I want that interruption. I have thought about the whole “second brain” idea, but I worry it would just become a dumping ground. Nothing would really resurface when it actually matters. I would mostly be relying on myself to remember that I once made a note about something when I happen to be working on a related problem. Lately I have been thinking about the idea of a passive, radio style feed that summarises the information I have collected and plays it back to me, so I can at least consume each item once. You see those TV shows about people who hoard. They cannot throw things away because they might be important one day. This feels uncomfortably similar. Maybe the real problem is not how we store information. Maybe it is that we aren't filtering hard enough on what is actually worth keeping in the first place. reply",

I think you’re pointing at two separate problems that get tangled: 1. Re-entry: how to resurface the right item when you’re actually in the right mode 2. Filtering: deciding what’s worth keeping so the backlog doesn’t become guilt The “radio-style passive feed” is interesting because it changes the contract: you’re not promising yourself you’ll do deep work, you’re just letting the system replay what you captured at a low cognitive cost. If it worked, it could also become a filter: only the stuff that still feels valuable on playback deserves a second pass. One question: if you had a “listen/read later” mode, would you prefer it to be time-based (10 minutes a day) or context-based (only when you mark yourself as in a “curious/exploration” headspace)?

For me, “listen later” or “read later” only really works when I am in a curious or exploratory headspace. That headspace is not always there. A good example is when I sit down to watch something on a streaming service and end up browsing for ages instead of committing to anything. In theory, that would be a perfect moment to actively review things I have saved, but in practice I am not convinced my neurodiverse brain would reliably cooperate. So to your question, I think I would lean much more toward a context-based mode than a time-based one. A fixed daily slot would quickly turn into another obligation.

          "text": "As mentioned in my current Ask HN post, the product is indeed not yet finalized or launched. The envisioned product, Concerns, acts as a bridge, linking your current concerns and target tasks to your knowledge base/resource repository and action list (which could be to-do lists, calendars, etc.), forming an organic closed-loop system. Using target/active projects within Concerns as triggers, it retrieves relevant information from your resource repository. It proactively pushes solutions, plans, and suggestions for users to filter. Selected items then enter the user's action list. The goal is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in a lightweight manner, without altering existing habits for using resource repositories or action lists. This idea stems from my own pain points, and I genuinely hope that while solving my own issues, it might also address broader needs. Regarding your response: It's interesting that AI tagging primarily aids by adding extra searchable keywords. However, I'd prefer broader content and semantic search/matching capabilities without relying solely on tags—though tagging remains a viable implementation approach.\nThanks for the mymind reference—I'll explore it.

I use agentic search in both entering and finding knowledge. Links, categories and metadata help the AI tremendously in finding relevant snippets. I go into more detail in this blog post [0].

The “unit test for knowledge” idea (a checker like bean-check, but for schema + links) feels like the missing feedback loop for most AI-assisted note workflows, and using git/history as the trust layer makes it much more auditable. I also like the idempotency/provenance angle (unique IDs/links, checkpointing) and the “commit processing” workflow — that’s a concrete example of turning ongoing work into structured, queryable knowledge without a ton of manual ceremony. Curious: in practice, what improved your quality the most — schema validation catching broken links/types, or constraining the entity set so the agent can’t invent structure? Also, do you find yourself actually using the query language day-to-day, or is it mostly agent-driven retrieval? I’m exploring a similar closed-loop (context → retrieval → suggestion → human review → write-back) and summarized my angle in my HN profile/bio if you want to compare approaches. reply",

Is there a timeline that requires things to be done before it becomes invalid or increases liability? Secondly, remembering to do actions instead of sitting down and doing something that gives some dopamine. I decide I want to work on a project on my computer. So I go sit down in front of the computer and... I've already forgotten the project, now it's time to play a game or read Hacker News instead. Lastly -- it's the things that I \"don't know\". Let's say I want to build a robotic lawnmower. There are plenty of robotic lawnmowers already but I want to build my own. I know where to find the source code (or I can make my own). I don't know where to find the tools, where to source components, or who to ask for help assembling heavy things; I don't know how to assess risks (what happens if this thing catches fire on my lawn while I'm in the kitchen? what happens if it drives into the street and hits a car? or worse, what happens if it drives into the neighbor's kids?). > 2.What best represents “active project context” for you today? In my head, mostly. Documents in random places like ~/Documents/<project-name>, or a todo.md in the project root. Hard to remember what <project-name> is for or when I last did anything of value for it though. > 3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that If the AI does not run 100% on my machine, then it's not getting anything important.

After that, it's pricing. If I spend $20 on a weekend project, that's fine. If I have to spend $20 for every task, then it'll be yet another project that is only ever half-finished. reply",

For Silverbullet specifically: what would “meaningfully useful” look like for you as a first step? 1. better recall (fuzzy/semantic search over saved links + notes) 2. periodic resurfacing (a digest of “you saved this months ago, might matter now”) 3. extracting a lightweight summary + a few key takeaways per link Details in my HN profile/bio if you want the longer context. reply",

It frames programming as a necessary evil we can finally be rid of.<p>The ironic thing is that I’m aiming for something similar, just for different reasons. I also want to write less code.<p>Less code because code equals responsibility. Less code because \"more code, more problems.\" Because bad code is technical debt. Because bugs are inevitable. Less code because fewer moving parts means fewer things can go wrong.<p>I honestly think I enjoy deleting code more than writing it. So maybe it’s not surprising that I’m skeptical of unleashing an AI agent to generate piles of code I don’t have a realistic chance of fully understanding.<p>For me, programming is fundamentally about building knowledge. Software development is knowledge work: discovering what we don’t know we don’t know, identifying what we do know we don’t know, figuring out what the real problem is, and solving it.<p>And that knowledge has to live somewhere.<p>When someone says \"I don’t write code anymore,\" what I hear is: \"I’ve shoved the knowledge work into a black box.\"<p>To me there’s a real difference between:<p>- knowledge expressed in language (which AI can produce ad nauseam), and<p>- knowledge that solidifies as connections in a human mind.<p>The latter isn’t a text file. It isn’t your \"skills\" or \"beads.\" It isn’t hundreds of lines of Markdown slop. No. It’s a mental model: what the system is, why it’s that way, what’s safe to change, what leverage the abstractions provide, and where the fragile assumptions lie.<p>I’ve always carried a mental model of the codebase I’m working in. In my head it’s not \"code\" in the sense of language and syntax. It’s more like a \"mind palace\" I can step into, open doors, close doors, renovate, knock down a wall, add a new wing. It happens at a level where intuition and intellect blend together.<p>I'm not opposed to progress. Lately, with everything going on, I’ve started dividing code into two categories:<p>- code I don’t need to model in my head (low risk, follows established conventions, predictable, easy to verify), and<p>- code I can't help modelling in my head (business-critical, novel, experimental, or introduces new patterns).<p>I’m fine delegating the former to an AI agent. The latter is where domain knowledge and system understanding actually forms. That’s where it gets interesting. That’s the fun part. And my \"mind palace\" craves to stay in sync with it.<p>Is the emerging notion that understanding code is somehow optional something you are worried about?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The problem with AI is that while someone may personally write less code, they are still responsible for it and have to answer questions about the minutiae of what it does.

Since AI has been a thing, I’ve been in a customer facing cloud consulting role - working full time at consulting departments (AWS ProServe) and now a third party company - specializing in app dev. Before my hands actually write a line of code or infrastructure as code, I’ve already spoken to sales to get a high level idea of  what the customer wants, read over the contract (SoW)  to see what questions I have, done discovery sessions/requirements analysis, created architecture diagrams, done a design review, created detailed stories/workstreams (epics), thought about all the way things can go wrong  etc. I very much keep my hands on the wheel and treat AI as a junior coder that might not follow my instructions. I can answer any question about architectural decisions, repo structure, what any Lambda does the naming conventions etc. I’ve also intuited “these are the things that I need to think about and test for from my 30 years of professional experience as a developer and 8 years of experience across literally dozens of AWS implementations”. In the before times, if I were doing this without AI, I would have to have two or three more junior people doing the work just because I couldn’t physically do it in 40 hours a week.  Even then I would be focused on how it works and look for corner cases. I don’t have to think about what I need to test for.  I did specifically call out concurrency because there are subtle bugs. Ironically, what I am working on now had a subtle concurrent locking bug that Codex wrote.  I threw the code into ChatGPT thinking mode and it found it immediately and suggested better alternatives.

I want to say, I've lived through the time (briefly) where folks felt if you didn't understand the memory management or, even assembly, level ops of code, you're not going to be able to make it great. High level languages, obviously, are a counter-argument that demonstrate that you don't necessarily need to understand all the details to deliver an differentiable experience. Personally, I can get pretty far with a high-level mental model and deeper model of key high-throughput areas in the system. Most individuals aren't optimizing a system, they're building on top of a core innovation. At the core you need to understand the system. Code is A language that describes it but there's others and arguably, in a lot of cases, a nice visual language goes much further for our minds to operate on. reply",

You can't validate the LLM outputs properly, and commit bugs and maybe even blatantly non-functional code. My company is pressuring juniors to use LLM when coding, and I'm finding none of them fully understand the LLM outputs because they don't have enough engineering experience to find code smells, bugs, regressions, and antipatterns. In particular, none of them have developed strong unit testing skills, and they let the LLM mock everything because they don't know any better, when they should generally only mock API dependencies. Sometimes LLM will even mock integration tests, which to me isn't generally a super good idea. So the tests that are supposed to validate the code are completely worthless. It has led to multiple customer impacting issues, and we spend more time mopping the slop than we do engineering as tenured engineers. reply",

          "text": "I've used Claude Code a lot over the last year and I've generally been very happy with it. I have a lot of experience writing code both professionally and for personal projects. I've found that for things like basic APIs and websites and database operations, I don't have to pay attention to the code being produced much at all anymore. It Just Works for the most part as long as you adequately describe what you're trying to build. There are only so many ways you can write a CRUD app after all, and generally the implementation isn't \"special\" just necessary. But my experience on 3d game dev in particular has been quite different. I've been able to get good results for basic 2d games and basic features in 3d worlds, but have been struggling to build more complicated scenarios with Claude Code without laying out every specific detail. I have to tell it to use quaternions for a particular rotation because I know about issues with gimble lock. I have to suggest a ray traced solution in another area because relative mouse position isn't good enough when accounting for resolution and aspect ratio. If I didn't know about ray tracing or quaternions and how they are used and fit into game development I wouldn't have been able to interrupt Claude Code and guide it down a better path. I think claude code is particularly weak in spatial reasoning and I suspect the context required for some GPU operations are pushing other parts of instructions out of context. It's forgetting \"the basics\" far more than I've experienced in any other project. Building a 3d world simulation featuring a bastardization of plate tectonics and weather systems is the first thing I've tried to do with Claude Code that I could have probably written myself faster.

          "text": "The \"good riddance\" attitude surprises me also. On one hand, it can be unpleasant to sort through obscure syntactical gobbledegook, like tracing around multiple levels of pointer indirection, but then again, I have found a certain enjoyable satisfaction in such things. It can be tough, but a good tough. It does seem to me that the people who consistently get the best results from AI coding aren't that far away from the code. Maybe they aren't literally writing code any more, but still communicating with the LLM in terms that come from software development experience. I think there will still be value in learning how to code, not unlike learning arithmetic and trigonometry, even if you ultimately use a calculator in real life. But I think there will also still be value in being able to code even in real life. If you have to fix a bug in a software product, you might be able to fix it with more precise focus than an LLM would, if you know where to look and what to do, resulting in potentially less re-testing. Personally, I balk at the idea of taking responsibility for shipping real software product that I (or, in a team environment, other humans on my team) don't understand. Perhaps that is my aerospace software background speaking -- and I realize most software is not safety-critical -- but I would be so much more confident shipping something that I understood how it worked. I don't know. Maybe in time that notion will fade. As some are quick to point out, well, do you understand the compiled/assembled machine code? I do not. But I also trust the compilation process more than I trust LLMs. In aerospace, we even formally qualify tools like compilers to establish that they function as expected. LLM output, especially well-guided by good prompts and well-tested, may well be high quality, but I still lack trust in it. reply",

Fanout × retries × context growth compounds in ways that linear cost models completely miss. The fix that worked for us: treat budget as a hard constraint, not a target. When you're approaching limit, degrade gracefully (shorter context, fewer tool calls, fallback to smaller model) rather than letting costs explode and cleaning up later. Also worth tracking: the 90th percentile request often costs 10x the median. A handful of pathological queries can dominate your bill. Capping max tokens per request is crude but effective. reply",

          "text": "+1 on interaction terms + tails : fanout × retries × context growth is where linear token math dies. One thing we do in enzu is make “budget as constraint” executable: we clamp `max_output_tokens` from the budget before the call, and in multi-step/RLM runs we adapt output caps downward as the budget depletes (so it naturally gets shorter/cheaper instead of spiraling). When token counting is unavailable we explicitly enter a “budget degraded” mode rather than pretending estimates are exact. Also agree p90/p95 cost/run matters more than averages; max-output caps are crude but effective.

I dropped into the local Apple Store (who supposedly have the ability to reset or create AppleIds) but, spoiler alert, after two hours they couldn't figure out why my phone number won't work.<p>Does anyone know if there's a way to create an AppleId w/o a phone number?  Apple's public docs say it's impossible.<p>Maybe there's an email alias I can use to submit my resume instead of buying an iProduct?<p>I guess I could get a dirt cheap sim for my (non-apple) phone and use it for a day, just to sign up for a new AppleId.  But somehow this seems... wrong.  It also seems unreasonable for a company to force me to buy an $1000 device just for the privilege of submitting my resume.<p>[edit: Forgot to mention, I own precisely zero iProducts.]</p></p></p></p></div>",

It's a very strange set of hoops to have candidates jump through. And sad, too.  I think my cover letter was one of the best I've ever written.  Now no one will be able to appreciate it but me. This is not how things were in the old days.  Back then we would just show up at a job site and after working for a few weeks go to HR and say \"hey.  I didn't get a check.\"  And then when HR couldn't find your records, they just assumed they were lost somewhere and helpfully set you up as an employee with information you gave them. How you have changed, outlaw sili valley. [Edit]\nSo when I say I have zero iProducts, that's not entirely true.  I do have an old 2015 era iMac.  But the first thing I did with it was put a new hard drive in it and boot up FreeBSD.  And then I installed Linux and installed FreeBSD as a VM under Linux because I have nothing better to do with my time.  And somewhere along the way L4 got wedged in there, because you're not a TRUE power user unless you have L4 running under bhyve under FreeBSD under KVM under linux on hardware the manufacturer would really prefer you just run Mach on.  I am wild.  I am the wind. So I found the old macOS hard drive and installed it.  It really did not want to boot.  It told me so many horrible things when I tried to boot, mostly that I really should visit an apple support web site.  The AppleID I'm trying to recover is the same one I used to create a macOS account with.  I wonder if apple knows I've installed Linux, FreeBSD and L4/Linux on their hardware and have marked my AppleId as \"unholy spawn of Satan\" ?  I guess if the roles were reversed I might think anyone who installed L4 on Apple Hardware is \"not to be trusted.\" Or more seriously...  I wonder if you don't boot macOS or log into macOS with your AppleId every now and again, you go on the \"naughty\" or \"potentially naughty\" list.  This whole affair really makes me miss my Atari 520ST.\n[/Edit] reply",

The likely issue you’re having on an older Mac and an older macOS is that it has an Apple root certificate that’s now expired and unable to register with either of those things. You’re SOL on anything prior to 10.10 Yosemite…. The apple root certs in 10.10 through 10.15 expired in 2019 and the installers for 10.10 through 10.15 were re-distributed by Apple with root certs expiring in 2029 [1] - (internet recovery should download and reinstall the new updated version with updated root certs if yours shipped with at least 10.10 Yosemite. You have to use the hotkey for internet recovery - not the recovery partition on your HDD) However….. OpenCore patcher will even let you install Tahoe, which doesn’t have this problem and will even get updates for another …(?) it’s the last Intel version , so whenever Apple says to hell with Intel I guess.

          "text": "Update... After a bit of work, I was able to boot the old hard drive with macOS and tried to log into apple services.  Of course it rejected my existing AppleId password, but this time with a working iMac, I asked it to send a reset code to my iMac. It seemed to think it sent one to my iMac, but nothing ever showed up.  The internet says it should have showed up on my iMac's screen or in the upper right corner of the screen.  No dice. This is similar to what happened at the Apple Store when we tried the \"use someone else's iProduct\" to reset the password.  The login page seemed to think it had sent a PIN, but it never showed up at the end device. I suspect that because I'm in the iForgot 24 hour cool down period, nothing is going to work.  They claim they will send instructions to my phone (I hope they realize my phone doesn't have iMessage) in 15 hours for what to do while waiting 30 or 90 days to try the reset again. This sort of reminds me when we got bought out and we had problems with our dev certificate.  We had released a couple versions of \"iFoo\" using our domain \"foo.com\".  Then we got bought out by bar.com and wanted to release future versions of iFoo under bar.com branding.  When we eventually got ahold of a human, they said we would have to re-release iFoo as iBar and re-submit it as a new app.  We eventually did this, but they responded that iBar was confusingly similar to an existing app called iFoo and they wouldn't allow it to be released in the app store.  Then they revoked the foo.com dev cert because of shinanigans.  When we tried to explain to them that we were following the instructions they had given us (and sending them emails and screenshots where they told us what to do,) they closed the support ticket and revoked bar.com's dev cert as well. I think Apple processes work very well for the usual case, but they don't think through some of the corner cases. The irony is the role I was attempting to apply for was one that would (partially) oversee working out these corner cases and what Apple should be doing in those situations.  I was invited to apply for this position explicitly because I had encountered similar problems in the past. My suspicion is I'll have a 30 day wait at the end of the initial iForgot 24 hour cool down.  If I'm still looking for a job in 30 days, I'll probably still submit my resume.  It seems that Apple really needs some help in this area. But I applied for a job in '93 and didn't get it and I've been told you're only allowed to apply to Apple once (despite having worked on the Qualcomm baseband processor in the original iPhone and as a contractor in the very early days of macontosh.)  And I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about me talking publicly about identity management corner cases.  I suspect the chance they would really care to hire me is fairly low. But if anyone from Apple ever reads this, feel free to contact me if you need more details on what inputs I provided to your system and what the responses were. reply",

          "text": "Another Update... at the end of the iforgot process, Apple is supposed to send you an update within 24 hours as to what the disposition of your password reset request will be.  In the past, if you opt not to receive a PIN via a registered iProduct, I've seen them say \"we're going to wait 30 days and then allow you to reset your password.\"  I imagine this is to discourage \"bad actors\" from launching massive efforts of password resetting.  If a bad guy was able to convince Apple that they were the TRUE owner of an account, maybe that would give them an advantage in stealing services or user data.  So sure, introducing a waiting time is not the worst idea in the world. About 15 hours ago, I went through the process again and the response was (and I paraphrase) \"tsk. tsk. do not annoy us with your password reset attempts.  we're going to tell you more about how to recover in 15 hours.\"  Again... annoying, but not horrible.  If we're trying to make things difficult for bad actors, this isn't that big of an annoyance. But at the end of the 24 hour waiting period, I still hadn't received an email from Apple at either of the email accounts I had used while trying to reset my AppleId.  (The first is the one the AppleId was explicitly tied to and the second was an alt I use mostly for newsletters and subscribing to web site updates I'm halfway interested in.  I used that because I couldn't remember if I had ever told Apple about that address.)  And that seemed frustrating.  You told me you were going to send me info about resetting my password, but you've welched on the deal. And then I had a disturbing thought... Several years ago I created an AppleId with my work phone and a completely different throw-away gmail address.  After digging up the password for that account, I logged in and sure enough... there's the email from Apple. The only thing I can think is Apple tied my IP Address or location to all three email addresses involved and somehow conflated them together.  I send a reset request from me@not-a-gmail-domain.com and get a response on havent_used_this_address_in_a_year@gmail.com.  That is very, very weird. But the good news is Apple says I only have to wait 7 days to reset the password on this account. I've been thinking about getting back into writing code for the PinePhone I bought a few years ago.  Maybe I will get a pre-paid t-mob or mint sim and try to create a new AppleId at a coffee shop on the far side of town. I can't say this has filled me with a great deal of optimism.  Obviously this isn't happening very often and I'm a corner case.  Otherwise we would surely have heard from thousands of people saying \"I can't log into my Apple account!\"  I'm also sure that when the Apple people were thinking through the process flows, they didn't assume I might try to reset my password while in the 24 hour iForgot wait state. I had been a registered Apple Developer since the late 80s, though the email address in question was only attached to my dev account since around 2006.  AppleIds as we know them have gone through changes... 2FA... removing questions... adding the ability to reset from an iProduct.  My guess is my id was generated shortly after AppleIds became a thing.  Then I stopped using it for a while and they changed the schema of the database holding AppleID details and maybe I didn't log in during some critical time frame.  Then I tried to log in and got marked as a bad guy trying to attack the security of Apple's user credential integrity.  I'm not... but of course, if I was I wouldn't admit it. In any event, I'm sure my original AppleId is hopelessly horked.  And that id was tied to the mobile number I've had since 1998.  I suspect if I try to use that number again, apple will take a look at my IP geolocation, match it to previous attempts to recover the password and assume I'm again a bad guy trying to do bad things.  If this hypothesis is correct, maybe my neighbors will have problems registering iProducts. Apple can, of course, do whatever the heck it wants.  I suspect they don't care enough to modify their processes because the number of people wedged in this state are vanishingly small.  Millions (billions?) of AppleIds have been registered.  Who cares if some dude from Seattle can't ever access Apple services with email or phone identifiers they want to use. I suspect the answer to this is going to be: a) spin up an entirely new email address.  I don't think apple will have a problem with me using gmail as I'm sure they have millions of customers that already use it. b) get a new phone number.  Like I said, I was thinking about doing some coding on my PinePhonePro, so that's not a completely bad idea. c) go across town to a coffee shop (or maybe the Apple store, do they have free wifi there?) and register a new AppleId. d) NEVER FORGET THE PASSWORD I USED. e) NEVER USE THAT AppleId AT MY HOME. This is probably overkill, but Apple has successfully hidden the details of their user credential processes and I have to imply state and state transitions from their public behaviour.  I really don't want to spent too much more time on this.  (Now that I think about it... the problems we had with our dev certificate a few years back absolutely had the same \"actual state is hidden behind an opaque wall of process\" characteristic.) All these problems are, I'm sure, Apple's way of limiting the effectiveness of social engineering attacks.  And that's something I can respect.  But if you're the by-catch of Apple's dragnet, it's absolutely annoying. reply",

Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Why pay artists for music, when you can just generate endless amount of AI music?<p>And even things like \"doing day to day chores\" are being automated away with tools like AI assistants. The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh*t throughout the day. How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI.<p>So my question HN: What's the point anymore? Why keep going and where to?</p></p></div>",

Becoming a successful writer / musician, is already hard. With software, it was easier, but in my opinion, it will become hard as well. There will be individuals in the software development who are like Taylor Swift, because they know how LLMs work, and how to optimize them to squeeze one more KPI. The rest will just be nobodies. And sure, if you think you are an extraordinary person, or you were born in the right environment, then you probably don't have to worry. But I'm an average Joe, who wants to live an average Joe's life, but it's being taken away from me. And while the select few might have access to a live Taylor Swift performance, or a personal reading of the latest novel by a struggling author, the rest of us are going to be fed AI slop. reply",

For creatives who are dedicated to their craft and are not in it for mass-market leverage, this is fine, it's going to be a filter.

And while sure, merit / good taste are important, but if you look at the mainstream it's filled with average. Now, from the consumer side you can claim \"what do you care about the mainstream, just look for good taste, and you will find it\", and I agree with you. But I do not speak about the consumer side, but rather the producer side. As a producer, I want to produce \"good taste\", but if there is very little demand for good taste things, I might struggle to sustain myself while producing based on merit. In the end, the reason enshittification exists, is because \"good taste\" stuff became too popular and the authors decided to capitalize on it (can't blame them when you have a mortgage to pay, and family to feed), and turn it into \"mainstream crap\". I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that creating good taste is not easy. And it will become even harder as the mainstream will expand and capture AI generated content, leaving people who believe in creation based on merit, fighting for the crumbs. reply",

There's more than you can ever listen to. You'll get tired of music as a whole before that. Here's some things AI can't do for you: Relationships and interacting with good people, every kind of sports and physical endeavour including any adventure you can think of, enjoying the perfection of nature.

Summaries won’t replace books, generated music won’t replace artists, and assistants won’t replace doing things yourself. They’ll replace the lowest friction default.

Some things don't actually need reliability.  That automated tool that's going to help a dozen people in accounting?  Yeah, it's got a buffer overflow, which also can be used for a DOS attack, but who cares?  (Unless someone like an AI exposes it to the internet...) For things where reliability does matter, AIs may be a fad for a couple of years, but it won't last, for exactly the reasons you mention.  For a bunch of things, reliability really matters .  For those places, you cannot be replaced by AI .  Migrate to those places. That leaves the problem of the next couple years.  You may need to look for places that understand, today, that reliability matters more than fast slop. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? I mean... for books (and movies) that I'm mildly interested in but don't want to take N hours to wade through, I've been reading the Wikipedia summaries for a while.  AI is here now, but I still go to Wikipedia, because I actually trust it more than the AI summary. reply",

It was pleasant, and I could feel that every hit really meant something to shape the future of the stone, and thereby the building. Customers and contractors alike told me how great it was to see me work that stone. So I kept swinging that hammer. Then I was told about some electrical chisel that was supposed to make my life better. Sure, I made more money, but the work was gone. It just shakes; it doesn't vibrate. I get numb, not proud. I have to take breaks, because my hands can't handle it. It's awful. What's the point, I asked? But then I started talking to my colleagues during those breaks. I even discovered I had a relative in common with one. While chipping away at stone, no one ever wanted to stand close to me, and I had spent all this time proudly creating stone chips all day long! I still chip away at stone sometimes, but only when there's no one else around to talk to at breaktime. --- You are not going to be able to stop change.

I'm barely touching current \"AI\" other than certain bits of code completion that are on by default in VS and are the right mix of occasionally useful (saving a few tens of keystrokes) and easy to ignore when not. When it gets to the point where I can't compete without using LLMs heavily, I'll have to do something else. Perhaps wait tables somewhere with Spanish customers as I'm trying to learn the language, it won't be much or a pay cut because by the point where someone of my years can't compete at all, almost anyone will be able to do a shite job with LLMs so programming will be heading towards being a minimum-wage job anyway. > Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Yours doesn't have to be. I started writing bits to go online again after many years not bothering. It isn't intended for public consumption, I'm deliberately doing nothing that would be called SEO in fact I'm going anti-SE in some ways, though it isn't hidden should I chose to pass a link to someone or if they decide to pass it on further. It is intended for me and a select few, if someone else finds it somehow and likes it then good the them, and much of the point of making it is the joy of making something. Everyone else using LLMs isn't going to take that from me. > Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Because the summary may be wrong, or technically correct but with entirely the wrong tone or missing key details a summary should have. Or because you want to read the post - you don't have to use the summary. I don't read the summary generated as part of most searches these days, reading them is optional. I don't make effort to stop them being made though (using porn mode, adding “fuck”/“fucking” to search terms, etc.) - hopefully making them waste resources on generating things that are never used will et noticed and they'll ramp that down a bit at least for accounts like mine. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Before AI, did you just skip to the last few pages to see what happened? If not, then just keep reading like you did before. Avoiding the slop books that are flooding the market ATM might be more of a concern, but there was plenty written before the LLM bubble started to keep you in things to read for a lifetime. > The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh t throughout the day.* Other hobbies. I like trail running (or if in a slower mood, country walking), AI isn't going to stop me doing that. HEMA and other activities with friends too. > How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI. That is a completely different question to the rest where you are asking about things that you would do for enjoyment, and is a bigger societal and philosophical concern than I have time to chew on right now… > What's the point anymore? Same as it was before: do what you need to do to survive, then do what you need to do to enjoy any remaining time after that. Perhaps I'm helped here by being back on the up after a couple of years recovering from proper burnout: I know the way things are going won't make me feel worse than that, and I survived that.

How to make it integrate with society better? How to deal with the myriad issues surrounding IP, rights, likeness stuff... there is a lot of fascinating work being done around AI to figure this all out. Were you only interested in technology so you could be one of the chosen elders holding a rare and valuable skill? Bummer if so, I think that ship has sailed. If not sunk altogether. Otherwise?

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am asking this question for my personal circumstances --- not a general statement about software engineering.<p>I am a CompSci senior focusing on ML. My university does not have applied research in ML, so doing ML in school (classes/research) is pretty much a one-way ticket to the theory/algorithms side of academia.<p>Last year, I had the epiphany that I am good at (and enjoy) solving problems by connecting components in a system instead of finagling a problem into a form where we can apply some mathematical law. Specifically, I have greatly enjoyed working with artists/UI/UX/frontend/non-tech people as their back-end counterpart. I have built data pipelines for MLEs, back-end for UI/UX/frontend designers, machine learning pipeline for BME researchers and projection/imagery software for artists.<p>I am pretty generalist and tool-agnostic, with more breadth than depth. That feels like software engineering.<p>That said, I do like to have an understanding of how things work and I have a decent tolerance for reading math. This is a really nerdy thing to say but I enjoyed deriving stuff like the convergence of gradient descent and I enjoyed real analysis. I also really enjoyed Nand2Tetris (open source course teaching you to build a minimal computer from NAND gates + compiler from OOP language to binary). It's extremely elegant to me, seeing the great design choices people made in the past. I feel like these are underappreciated in software engineering.<p>Right now, I have an opportunity to work with my RL professor, who has an amazing track record publishing at top conferences. I am really on the fence because his research is in RL algorithms and I had a very bad experience in my last algorithm research project somewhere else (I had a vague idea of what we were doing but nowhere near enough to make contributions). I am concurrently applying to jobs and Master's and I am pretty sure I will never touch this topic again if I go into industry after graduation.<p>I have these two questions:\n1) Do I sound like the software engineers you know? What other roles do you think I am a good fit for?\n2) Should I take this opportunity simply for research exposure? Do you think this is necessary in helping me keep up with trends as an applied practitioner in ML?<p>P.S. This is my first time posting on HN and this seems a lot longer than the average Ask HN post. I don't know if that's appropriate. Please lmk if I should go to a subreddit instead.<p>Thanks in advance if you read all that!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm at 160wpm with my apple keyboard [0]. It's easily my favourite keyboard of all time but I'd love an ergo keyboard with chiclet keys and a built in mouse. I was looking at the cybord imprint [1] and the kinese advantage 360 [2] but the kinesis despite its infinite good reviews doesn't have a mouse and is too expensive for me although it is wireless, same with the imprint. My goal is to ziptie it to my herman miller aeron armrests so I don't have to ever move my arms, and I can swing around to look at my other monitors without craning my neck. Any out of the box solutions I can order that don't need soldering and assembly? There seem to be few.<p>[0] https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/mxk83ll/a/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-and-numeric-keypad-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb%E2%80%91c-us-english-black-keys  \n[1] https://cyboard.digital/products/imprint\n[2] https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/</p></div>",
