          "text": "I've not found it that great at programming in cobol, at least in comparison to its ability with other languages it seems to be noticeably worse, though we aren't using any models that were specifically trained on cobol. It is still useful for doing simple and tedious tasks, for example constructing a file layout based on info I fed it can be a time saver, otherwise I feel it's pretty limited by the necessary system specifics and really large context window needed to understand what is actually going on in these systems. I do really like being able to feed it a whole manual and let it act as a sort of advanced find. Working in a mainframe environment often requires looking for some obscure info, typically in a large PDF that's not always easy to find what you need, so this is pretty nice. reply",

I do love AI for writing yaml and bicep. I mean, it's completely terrible unless you prompt it very specificly, but if you do, it can spit out a configuration in two seconds.

          "text": "I’m being pushed to use it more and more at work and it’s just not that great. I have paid access to Copilot with ChatGPT and Claude for context. The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform. Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies. So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops! I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole. reply",

For the terminology, I consider \"vibe-coding\" as Claude etc. coding agents that sculpts entire blocks of code based on prompts. My use-tactic for LLM/AI-coding is to just get the signature/example of some functions that I need (because documents usually suck), and then coding it myself. That way the control/understanding is more (and very egoistically) in my hands/head, than in LLMs. I don't know what kind of projects you do, but many times the magic of LLMs ends, and the discussion just starts to go same incorrect circle when reflected on reality. At that point I need to return to use classic human intelligence. And for COBOL + AI, in my experience mentioning \"COBOL\" means that there is usually DB + UI/APP/API/BATCHJOB for interacting with it. And the DB schema + semantics is propably the most critical to understand here, because it totally defines the operations/bizlogic/interpretations for it. So any \"AI\" would also need to understand your DB (semantically) fully to not make any mistakes. But in any case, someone needs to be responsible for the committed code, because only personified human blame and guilt can eventually avert/minimize sloppiness. reply",

We have a statically generated knowledge base of the migrated sourcecode that can be used as context for LLMs to work with, but even that is often not enough to do anything meaningful. At times Opus 4.5 is able to debug small errors in COBOL modules given a stacktrace and enough hand-holding. Other models are decent at explaining semi-obscure COBOL patterns or at guessing what a module could be doing just given the name and location -- but more often than not they end up just being confidently wrong. I think the best use-case we have so far is business rule extraction - aka understanding what a module is trying to achieve without getting too much into details. The TLDR, at least in our case, is that without any supporting RAGs/finetuning/etc all kind of AI works \"just ok\" and isn't such a big deal (yet) reply",

          "text": "Given the mass of code out there, it strikes me it's only a matter of time before someone fine tunes one of the larger more competent coding models on COBOL. If they haven't already. Personally I've had a lot of luck Opus etc with \"odd\" languages just making sure that the prompt is heavily tuned to describe best practices and reinforce descriptions of differences with \"similar\" languages. A few months ago with Sonnet 4, etc. this was dicey. Now I can run Opus 4.5 on my own rather bespoke language and get mostly excellent output. Especially when it has good tooling for verification, and reference documentation available. The downside is you use quite a bit of tokens doing this. Which is where I think fine tuning could help. I bet one of the larger airlines or banks could dump some cash over to Anthropic etc to produce a custom trained model using a corpus of banking etc software, along with tools around the backend systems and so on. Worthwhile investment. In any case I can't see how this would be a threat to people who work in those domains. They'd be absolutely invaluable to understand and apply and review and improve the output. I can imagine it making their jobs 10x more pleasant though. reply",

During my years as a developer, I've often faced the skepticism surrounding automation technologies, especially when it comes to legacy languages like COBOL. There’s a perception that as AI becomes more capable, it might threaten specialized roles. However, I believe that the intricacies and context of legacy systems often require human insight that AI has yet to master fully.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">To make a preface first: I am currently located in Belgrade, Serbia and I am trying to see where I could find potential investor for the project I am working on.<p>I know the places such as OpenVC https://www.openvc.app/, but I do not know anyone that had any experience with it. I am really not sure if anyone has invested in projects from Serbia outside ElevenFund, SouthCentral Ventures and few more.<p>For someone wondering why not to look for local investments: Aside from the current political turmoil, the investment here is not that encouraging - you give away a large percent of equity for the investment that is not enough to cover yearly costs in some cases.<p>About the project: I come from the HR field, and in current climate finding job is really hard. A lot of candidates apply, and at the same time a lot of positions are saturated with applications, that most of the time are not even viewed. This in turn makes finding job even harder.<p>The traditional ATS model feels like black hole where you just throw your resume and hope for the best. With the addition of AI to analyze and pick resumes it gets even worse. Additionally, a lot of them are saturated with features which most people either don't use or know how to use at all.<p>Getting rejected from one company shouldn't be the end of the road when searching for job, it should be just the start until it is finished and concludes with hiring somewhere.<p>The idea itself is to connect applicants (with their consent) that have been rejected, with other companies that are looking for same profiles. This cuts Time To Hire saving the costs for company on the one side, and at the same time it cuts the time for people to find a job, since the system matches them with potential companies in a similar way like dating apps. It can also reduce reliance on hiring agencies as time goes by.<p>As more people use the ATS the database will get bigger, thus the quality of the matches will get better. The AI here can be used for better matchmaking and building better recommendation system, while making sure that there is human behind the feels to check every match, resume and so on.<p>I have already built an MVP that shows how it would function, and am currently in the process of working out with friend in making it to be in usable state for others. I've researched PMF (Product Market Fit) and how it fits in current market. As for the monetization I have additional ideas aside for the typical subscription payed per seat/package.<p>The product itself is B2B oriented with both the individuals and companies being the beneficiaries of it.<p>I am open to hearing more on how should I proceed in this regards and where to go next really because finding investment from Serbia seems like looking to find a needle in a haystack.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

More details about the project can be found in the README at <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme</a>.<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081</a> - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd</a>.</p></p></p></p></div>",

But the quality of submissions has been surprisingly good and I am genuinely delighted by the number of interesting websites I have came across in the last few hours. So I have gone ahead and removed the overly restrictive criteria language. > Was hoping it would be a way to stumble upon potentially underrepresented content from folks in the hacker news community who don't normally get attention.

These are companies who employ multiple small teams (think 3-4 people), and each team is charged with cloning one of the most popular apps - they have really abbreviated development cycles, on the order of 6 weeks, and they just keep churning till they've drowned every app on the leaderboard in clones.

If your business is \"a flashlight app\", yeah, eventually they'll copy it (as it happened). However they'll take an unusual long time to do that simple thing (as it also happened). Why? Because everything at big companies is a political game, full of internal conflicts, multiple priorities, non-collaborative teams, self-interest, promotion games, and a bunch of other things not really related to build the thing in question. It very rarely has anything to do with how fast the code can be written. If your business is good enough and becomes something more than \"a piece of software\", and solves a problem, becomes a brand, has great user feedback... that's not something you can \"copy in no time\". reply",

One can see this from the failure of google+ (and killing off beloved apps, like reader on its altar, when I would argue if they are thinking platform, the idea is to make any app insert data into the platform, you don't want to push away users, you want to get them using the platform with them even knowing it). Or their disjointed messaging strategy for many years (which might not even matter, they seemingly have given up on it?).  It shouldn't matter what messaging app someone uses, let it use a common platform.  Spend the money on figuring out how to make them use a common platform, because killing their app just pushes them away and you are not guaranteed that they will move to your new app vs something else.  Moving their old app to your new platform, again, keeps them as users, increases the value of the platform (as more users are inserting dfata into it) which makes it more valuable to others to do the same.  One might have different apps geared towards differ things (someone might be happy with just text messaging, another might want video and text messaging, but if you kill the first guy's app and expect him to move, he might just as quickly move to whatsapp or something else). reply",

          "text": "This seems like a very jaded comment, and if it’s because you got burned in a startup, then you have my sympathy and I’m sorry for debating. Just know that not everyone is running on nothing but greed. You might be confusing VCs with startup founders a bit. VCs are definitely profit motivated, by design. It’s going too far, and incorrect IMO, to suggest even VCs, or anyone involved, doesn’t care about building solutions or care about customers. All founders I’ve ever met care about what they make, and most VCs care about it somewhat but also care that the founders care strongly; they don’t often fund founders who don’t care. So can you source any of your claims of “most”? I just looked it up, and the majority of software startups are self-funded or angel/seed-funded, not VC funded. Founders that don’t care about product or customers enough tend to fail. Founders that only care about the payoff don’t tend to self-fund their startup. That said, everyone and all companies have financial incentives. There’s nothing unique or new about software startup founders there. The entire economy runs on profit motive. And I’ve seen a lot more people who don’t care about customers or product working in large companies making a nice easy salary working 9 to 5 (or less)! My personal sampling of founders vs company workers is that founders are, by far , the ones who care more deeply about building something new and delighting customers and growing a sustainable business, care enough to start working nights and weekends, go years with crappy pay or no pay, to do every job in the company from engineering to design to marketing to support to filing taxes. Some people certainly are at least partially motivated to accept these sacrifices for the chance at a payoff, but lots of founders would prefer a lifestyle company where they get to keep building and don’t have the insane pressures and politics of a unicorn company. Pivots are a thing because good product ideas often are not good business ideas. Startups that fail to pivot are the ones that die, and if your startup dies you don’t get to care about what you’re building or about customers at all. If you want companies to care about product and customers and not profit, then you should embrace sustainable economics, and that means making things people will pay for, and when they’re not paying, making something else. reply",

However, there is an absolute limit to how much money a company can leave on the table, regardless of what the customer wants, and serving the customer’s best interest becomes a ‘bad decision’ and threatens the ability for the company to do anything for the customer the moment it’s unprofitable, as soon as costs exceed income.

I have read the thread, thank you, and you certainly have been talking about startups and founders as if these issues are unique to them. It’s not just ‘yeah yeah big companies too’… if you actually care about and study enshittification at all, it is, by and large, entirely coming from big companies, and it isn’t new to software, it has always been happening. The only thing new is a cute term for it that got popular recently. Old business terms that mean the same thing include: loss leader, hook product, bait and switch, and plain old “promotion”. Regardless of what the topic here is, it doesn’t make sense to harp on startups over quality going down. For that to happen, it had to be higher at some point, and that point is: startups. VC funding might lead to some quality decline, but all companies trim and get worse as they grow, and always have. Startup is the phase when companies provide the highest level of product or service. reply",

Execution and distribution are the real bottlenecks. Big companies can copy your product, but they usually won’t copy:\n– your speed early on\n– your willingness to serve a tiny, unsexy niche\n– your ability to change direction without internal politics In practice, most startups don’t die because a big company copied them. They die because they never found real users who cared enough to pay. The moat today often looks like:\n– deep understanding of a specific workflow or pain point\n– trust with a narrow audience\n– compounding advantages (data, habits, integrations, community) If your plan is “build something cool and hope it sticks”, it’s probably not worth it.\nIf your plan is “solve a painful problem for a very specific group, then expand”, it still is.

Code was always cheap. But architecture, distribution, quality control, integration once landed, this is where money is mostly made. Most indie or small companies die because they just pick shitty problems. eg nobody cares about a goddamn notes app, the one on Mac works fine and most people write garbage in their notes like utter trash. So obviously a notes app has little value because the asset it manages has very little value. Not so much if you are building something like document storage for regulated industries. Or compliance software. In these cases, its the business domain expertise which counts. Even when applying for jobs without domain expertise code monkeys never get paid past a threshold. People / entities that command a premium are the ones with domain knowledge. reply",

AFAICT, moats are bigger now than ever before, but the moats I see are centered around things like consumer habits and B2B contracts and hub/platform experiences. People tend to like the software they know & have, or the contractors they know already, even when they complain about it. The need to overcome static friction is a moat, one that makes it harder for startups to get in, but easier to stay once you’re in. Big companies are slow. It seems like it would be easy for them to copy products, but they rarely do, and even when they try they take forever. Worry about yourself first, whether you can deliver, whether your product is superior, whether you can get customers, whether your business is sustainable, etc.. Worry about other startups second. They can copy faster than big companies. Do you have an edge over other startups? Don’t worry about the big companies. If they aren’t already solving the problem you want to solve, they won’t start until after you’re successful. Note acquisitions are a thing! Big companies that want to copy your product are aware that the fastest way to do that is to acquire a working solution and a pile of new customers. You should be thinking about big companies more as opportunity than competition. reply",

You can see an example comparing semantic (i.e., embeddings-based) search vs bm25 vs hybrid here: http://search-sensei.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (warning! It will download ~50MB of data for the model weights and onnx runtime on first load, but should otherwise run smoothly even on a phone) This mini app illustrates the advantage of semantic vs bm25 search. For instance, embedding models \"know\" that j lo refers to jennifer lopez.

I look forward to checking this one out! I don't know if this is too much to ask, but something that would really help me adopt your model is to include a fine-tuning setup. The BGE series of embeddings-models has been my go-to for a couple of years now -- not because it's the best-performing in the leaderboards, but because they make it so incredibly easy to fine-tune the model [0]. Give it a JSONL file of a bunch of training triplets, and you can fine-tune the base models on your own dataset. I appreciate you linking to the paper on the recipe for training this type of model -- how close to turnkey is your model to helping me do transfer learning with my own dataset? I looked around for a fine-tuning example of this model, and didn't happen to see anything, but I would be very interested in trying this one out. Does support for fine-tuning already exist? If so, then I would be able to switch to this model away from BGE immediately. * [0] - https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/tree/master/exampl... reply",

The tradeoff here is that you get even faster inference, but lose on retrieval accuracy [0]. Specifically, inference will be faster because essentially you are only doing tokenization + a lookup table + an average. So despite the fact that their largest model is 32M params, you can expect inference speeds to be higher than ours, which 23M params but it is transformer-based. I am not sure about typical inference speeds on a CPU for their models, but with ours you can expect to do ~22 docs per second, and ~120 queries per second on a standard 2vCPU server. As far as retrieval accuracy goes, on BEIR we score 53.55, all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (a widely adopted compact text embedding model) scores 42.69, while potion-8M scores 30.43. I can't find their larger models but you can generally get an idea of the power level of different embedding models here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard If you want to run them on a CPU it may make sense to filter for smaller models (e.g., <100M params).\nOn the other side our models achieve higher retrieval scores.

          "text": "For vector generation I started using Meta-LLama-3-8B in april 2024 with Python and Transformers for each text chunk on an RTX-A6000. Wow that thing was fast but noisy and also burns 500W. So a year ago I switched to an M1 Ultra and only had to replace Transformers with Apple's MLX python library. Approximately the same speed but less heat and noise. The Llama model has 4k dimensions so at fp16 thats 8 kilobyte per chunk, which I store in a BLOB column in SQLite via numpy.save(). Between running on the RTX and M1 there is a very small difference in vector output but not enough for me to change retrieval results, regenerate the vectors or change to another LLM. For retrieval I load all the vectors from the SQlite database into a numpy.array and hand it to FAISS. Faiss-gpu was impressively fast on the RTX6000 and faiss-cpu is slower on the M1 Ultra but still fast enough for my purposes (I'm firing a few queries per day, not per minute). For 5 million chunks memory usage is around 40 GB which both fit into the A6000 and easily fits into the 128GB of the M1 Ultra. It works, I'm happy. reply",

          "text": "Sure, I've managed both clusters and single node deployments in production until 2025 when I changed jobs. Elastic definitely does have its strengths, but they're increasingly enterprise-oriented and appear not to care a lot about open source deployments. At one point Elastic itself had a severe regression in an irreverible patch update (!?) which took weeks to fix, forcing us to recover from backup and recreate the index. The documentation is or has been ambigious and self-contradicting on a lot of points. The Debian Elastic Enterprise Search package upgrade script was incomplete, so there's a significant manual process for updating the index even for patch updates. The interfaces between the different components of the ELK stack are incoherent and there's literally a thousand ways to configure them. Default setups have changed a lot over the years, leading to incoherent documentation. You really need to be an expert at Elastic in order to run it well – or pay handsomely for the service. It's simply too complicated and costly for what it is, compared to more recent alternatives. reply",

This may be of interest: https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/Blended-RAG > So we'd probably find an even split of people who would call this RAG or not. Maybe but not likely. This is sometimes called the 50-50 fallacy or the false balance of probability or the equiprobability bias. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4310748/ “The equiprobability bias (EB) is a tendency to believe that every process in which randomness is involved corresponds to a fair distribution, with equal probabilities for any possible outcome. The EB is known to affect both children and adults, and to increase with probability education. Because it results in probability errors resistant to pedagogical interventions, it has been described as a deep misconception about randomness: the erroneous belief that randomness implies uniformity. In the present paper, we show that the EB is actually not the result of a conceptual error about the definition of randomness.” You can also find an ELI5 Reddit thread on this topic where one comment summarizes it as follows: “People are conflating the number of distinguishable outcomes with the distribution of probability directly.” https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1bpor68/... reply",

The real lightbulb moment is when you realise the ONLY thing a RAG passes to the LLM is a short string of search results with small chunks of text. This changes it from 'magic' to 'ahh, ok - I need better search results'. With small models you cannot pass a lot of search results ( TOP_K=5 is probably the limit ), otherwise the small models 'forget context'. It is fun trying to get decent results - and it is a rabbithole, next step I am going into is pre-summarising files and folders.

BM25 allows you to efficiently enumerate all code locations in your codebase that need to change and then you can set the cli coders off using this list.

Studies generally show when you do agentic retrieval w/ text search, that's pretty good. Adding vector retrieval and graph rag, so the typical parallel multi-retrieval followed by reranking, gives a bit of speedup and quality lift. That lines up with my local flow experience, where it is only enough that I want that for $$$$ consumer/prosumer tools, and not easy enough for DIY that I want to invest in that locally. For those who struggle with tools like spotlight running when it shouldn't, that kind of thing turns me off on the cost/benefit side. For code, I experiment with unsound tools (semgrep, ...) vs sound flow analyzers, carefully setup for the project. Basically, ai coders love to use grep/sed for global replace refactors and other global needs, but keeps tripped up on sound flow analysis. Similar to lint and type checking, that needs to be setup for a project and taught as a skill. I'm not happy with any of my experiments here yet however :( reply",

What a coding agent needs is to be able to locate portions of source code relevant to what it has been tasked with, and preferably in more context-efficient fashion than just grepping and loading entire source files into context. One way to do this is something like Cursor's vector index of code chunks, and another would be something like TreeSitter (or other identifier-based tools) that knows where identifiers (variables, functions) are defined and used. Language servers (LSP) are not useful for this task since they can't tell the agent \"where is function foo() defined\" (but TreeSitter can), since as someone else noted language servers are based on location (line number) not content (symbols). Language servers are designed to help editors. It's possible that ast-grep might be some some use to a coding agent, but looking for syntax/AST patterns rather than just identifier definitions and usages seems a much more niche facility. reply",

          "text": "We handle ~300k customer interactions per day, so latency and precision really matter. We built an internal RAG-based portal on top of our knowledge base (basically a much better FAQ). On the retrieval side, I built a custom search/indexing layer (Node) specifically for service traceability and discovery. It uses a hybrid approach — embeddings + full-text search + IVF-HNSW — to index and cross-reference our APIs, services, proxies and orchestration repos. The RAG pipelines sit on top of this layer, which gives us reasonable recall and predictable latency. Compliance and observability are still a problem. Every year new vendors show up promising audits, data lineage and observability, but none of them really handle the informational sprawl of ~600 distributed systems. The entropy keeps increasing. Lately I’ve been experimenting with a more semantic/logical KAG approach on top of knowledge graphs to map business rules scattered across those systems. The goal is to answer higher-level questions about how things actually work — Palantir-like outcomes, but with explicit logic instead of magic. Curious if others are moving beyond “pure RAG” toward graph-based or hybrid reasoning setups. reply",

You want to just hang out, you reach out and propose what you’re doing. You want more purposeful and meaningful time, join a volunteer group you vibe with. Even if it’s meeting for coffee. You have to be the one who reaches out. You have to do it on a regular cadence. If, like me, you don’t have little alarms in your head that go off when you haven’t seen someone in a while, you can use automated reminders. I have observed my spouse (who is not on social media) do this and she maintains friendships for decades this way. Nowadays she has regular zoom check ins, book clubs, and more, even with people who moved to the other coast. You do now have the tools for this. I have adopted it into my own life with good results. Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on. You are struggling against many aspects of the way we in the developed world/nerd world live. We have a wealth of passive entertainment, often we have all consuming jobs or have more time-consuming relationship with our families than our parents ever did. We move to different cities for jobs, and even as suburban sprawl has grown, you’re on average probably further away from people who even live in the same city! You get from place to place in a private box on wheels, or alternatively in a really big box on wheels with a random assortment of people. You don’t see people at church, or market day, or whatever other rituals our ancestors had. On the positive side, you have more tools and leisure than ever before to arrange more voluntary meetings. reply",

I have kept my public and official New Year’s resolutions for 37 years running. I’m up to “intentional and senseless acts of violence that end in the injury of innocents“. You may scoff, but senselessness is highly contextually dependent and can easily apply to something that seemed rational under the fog of circumstance. Thats actually not that easy to promise without forsaking the option of violence altogether, which I am not at liberty to do, since I have a family to protect. It’s a slow, intentional process. I don’t want to risk overreaching. Still, they are worthwhile goals. Low-hanging fruit is still fruit. The useful thing to me has been to expect little from people and life in general, but a lot of myself. Then be delighted when things go as they should, or when people come through. It’s a contagious positivity masquerading as cynicism, or maybe the other way around, I’m not sure… but it allows me to focus on my role in things, my choices, my actions, and reactions to the external world.  It is stoicism adjacent. The New Year’s resolutions are mostly an advertising campaign for the overall philosophy, really, by promising people easy success in something that is often a struggle, and illuminating the fact that we choose our successes and failures by how we view external circumstances, not so much by the circumstances themselves. reply",

I've always focused on the intent (why do I want to attend?) and a few crux details; everything else tends to work out or is just not that important. It seems to be one of the areas where \"fake it until you make it\" not only works but might be superior to ultra-planning. Once you've got the gist down, try and find one thing that you can go a little overboard on; it makes it very memorable. Examples: I made a big pot of home-made chili once, and another time we did (what looked like) an extravagant nacho bar. It was both better and way cheaper than typical event food. Definitely enlist an accomplice, but be aware you likely need to (appear to) be the mastermind. reply",

The social hosting skill I’ve observed and and able to do as well is extraordinarily high.  People throw parties, know how to act, are cordial and polite and seem to reasonably enjoy each others company while also teaching their children the same. This is how I remember mere middle class parents acting in the late 90s and early 2000s but my fellow millennials and z seem to be completely incapable of. One huge aspect I’ve noticed is that it’s wildly expensive in time and money to host.  An open cocktail night cost me nearly 3000 dollars to host.   I can imagine this would not be common for Gen Z these days. reply",

As something of an adult myself (I'm 46), I'm well aware of how community functions. I'm also aware of the 'keeping up with the jones' nature of wealth and how corrosive that is to community - being entirely founded on the selective and exclusive nature of spending. My contention stands, there is no need whatsoever to spend thousands on a cocktail party. One doesn't need to 'opt out' of social life. It's perfectly possible to serve cocktails yourself, to buy 'off the shelf' brands rather than expensive whiskey etc. It's perfectly possible to prepare your own food, or work with a chef who organises 'super club' style catering, which does not cost thousands. It's a choice to live this way, not a fate. And doubtless it affords status among other high worth individuals - just as it dooms you to a life of fruitless comparison and ostentatiousness. reply",

My approach around this is suggesting the idea to people up front and then throwing everyone into a WhatsApp chat and laying down the plan. Anyone who can't join gets removed/leaves. No one expects a whatsapp group to be a refined VIP experience. It's just people getting together and sharing an experience. Having moved countries and needing to start up a new friend group, things like Meetup or Facebook groups help a lot. There are _many_ people out there who are looking to meet people. For throwing a party, my general rule of thumb is expect 50% of people to turn up. reply",

So far it hasn't happened at all, they just receive our graciousness and move on immediately. reply",

          "text": "I sometimes wonder about this, I have a friend who does most of the organizing for parties or whatever. My sense is that there are a few different kinds of people, among those are people who, if they didn't organize parties, there wouldn't really be much of a platform for hanging out for them and others like them, while others are completely isolated, don't organize and don't have any other third space, and others yet have many smaller interactions from many other parts of life that don't necessitate a larger meetup necessarily. If you're an \"organizer\" type, my guess is that the people you'd hope reciprocate fall into the latter camp; they're happy to show up and have a good time, but they probably have a bunch of other things to explore that for some reason they haven't felt you'd be into... or a bunch of other possible reasons. Asking them to host a party is asking them to fabricate a social setting from thin air, but maybe they just organically don't find that to be something they need to do. For me, I'll host something for a small group if I get some inspiration, but on a week to week basis I'm often in extremely social third-spaces, supplemented by larger parties (probably bi-weekly). My effort is often best spent meeting people for deliberate, intimate, outdoor sports adventures or coffee hangouts, but the same person I know who tends to organize larger parties doesn't really feel like someone who'd be into these; they can't really hold a conversation 1 on 1 for very long, and they're not super curious or vulnerable or athletic in the way that's necessary to engage in those as much. He's a regimented, scheduled, impatient, person. They often need a sort of fabricated social vehicle (also likes to decorate and host), whereas I get nearly all of my socializing from incidentally being in social space. I think it's fine to be either of course. It's ok that my organizer friend doesn't like heights, and so I won't invite him to climb mountains, he likes hosting parties, so I try to attend as many as I can. Note that I don't mean the non-organizer (me) is just passively socializing, it's just that they have different catalysts built into the things they do that extend into socializing easily. I'm DMing 1 or 2 friends, multiple times a week, to do something we both enjoy or just chat while walking around the city. While parties and hosted things are neat, they're just not very good platforms for depth. Just as well, I do try and be inviting to everyone who'd like to come out and do other things, in general it's important to reciprocate, but I'm not hosting a party just because someone else did. reply",

Curious what others do and in what context. It makes tons of sense for a dedicated device in a work context. At home do you have a different account for say your kid?

This might be a bit much for most people. The idea is that my main personal and work accounts use exclusively open source apps, and any context which demands proprietary apps gets siloed off somewhere. Two of the user accounts have google services framework installed, but neither is logged in to the play store. The reason that the phone is more complex is that I am essentially never forced to use proprietary apps on my desktops, there has always been a way to work around it. But not so on the phone. reply",

          "text": "I found out my crimson-bellied conure is laying an egg today! She's nesting in some towels now, chirping away while she works on laying it. Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds. She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute. I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me. She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :) So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with! Birds :) reply",

          "text": "I got a handheld emulator console as a Christmas gift. Configuring shaders that emulate crt TVs, I realized I had no mental model of how those TVs worked at all. I’m used to “pixels are three little lights combining rgb colors”, which doesn’t work here, so I went on a rabbit hole and let me tell you, analog TVs are extremely impressive tech. Getting an electron beam to hit a glass, making the chemicals on it spark, covering it in a “reading motion” for hundreds of lines, and doing that 60 times a second! And the beam is oriented by just careful usage of magnets. It sounds super sci-fi for an already dead, 130 years old technology. I also learned that my childhood was a lie. Turns out that the logic in consoles of the time was tied to the speed of the beam, which in turn used alternating current’s frequency as a clock. This means that since European current changes 50 times per second rather than 60, our games played in slowmo (about 0.8x). American sonic was so much faster! And the music was so much more upbeat! reply",

Page after page was transmitted after one-another, repeatedly. It was sometimes used for subtitles, with some pages with a transparent background. Better receivers cached pages so you wouldn't have to wait for its next transmission when going to another page... Digital television formats adopted the framing from analogue formats and sends the same data in digital form within the vertical blanking interval. Many channels have stopped offering teletext. One network here in Sweden still uses it to deliver news, and I often prefer that format because the articles are concise and distraction-free. BTW.

What surprised me the most was that shiro (white) miso and aka (red) miso are both the same mix of soybeans, salt, and rice malt but fermented for different periods of time. As the miso ferments for longer, its color becomes darker while its flavor becomes milder and more complex. Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic. After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Most miso you can buy in a grocery store is created through forced fermentation over a few months, so if you ever get a chance to try naturally aged miso I would highly recommend! reply",

Syrah - red grape, red wine.\n7. Grenache Noir - red grape, red wine.\n8. Sauvignon Blanc - white grape, white wine.\n9. Pinot Noir - red grape, red wine.\n10. Trebbiano Toscano / Ugni Blanc - white grape, white wine. There are some wines which are produced with red grapes which are not left on skins so there is no impartation of red colour, but they are really not common and the result is most of the time a bit closer to a light rose than what would be considered a white wine. Perhaps the only style that would be semi-frequently encountered are some French Blanc de Noirs wines, various champagne examples being the most common of these. (And of course standard champagne itself, but I am not sure if that is really considered a white wine). Still, rare. It is also not possible to produce a red wine with a white grape, there is no colour in the skin to impart. [0]: https://londonwinecompetition.com/en/blog/insights-1/how-the... reply",

My ICE propelled two wheel journey started only about a year ago with a 50cc moped, but I've since graduated to 125cc (mostly because I learned that here in Portugal, with the licence for a car, I can drive up to 125cc (in my country the limit is 50cc, which is why I started there)). The moped was second hand SYM Jet 14, but the 125cc that I got was a brand new Honda CB125F, the very newest of models. It's incredibly fun and since I mostly use it to go to work and back everyday, it's more than enough. In the post titled \"Buying an unseen 1959 Triumph Bonneville T120\", at the start there's a typo: \"A lot of people wanted Harleys – but for some reason they just did spark anything in me.\" This is probably just my personal error, but whenever I see Triumph bikes, I can't help but think about underwear brand Triumph (which are of very high quality, I've got a few, would recommend), I haven't tried any Triumph bikes but I do want to one day! reply",

It's rather easy with physical books (or was, as we have little room left for even more books ;-0) but ebooks are  \"dangerous\" too. Regarding cameras, it's harder (and more expensive) to wrangle with gear acquisition syndrome (GAS) but after switching from Canon EOS to Fuji, because the Canon stuff was too heavy when hiking, I managed to restrain myself most of the time. Because the question always is whether my images would become better with different gear or with more trial and error. I opted for trial and error and eagerly watch a selected number of YouTube channels who almost always show me that I  should and can improve myself and not my gear. reply",

          "text": "Thanks a lot! Yes, I agree that it is easier with physical books although even there I can already see that I may be painting myself into a corner. But ebooks are obviously \"worse\" in that regard. I loved when I found StandardEbooks.org and Gutenberg - all these classic books for free. But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing. With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself. There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those \"perfect\" images. When in fact nothing is keeping me from going out and shooting those \"perfect\" images with the camera I already have. reply",

          "text": "I was able to find this blog post of a deep-dive into the ALPSTUGA: https://danieldk.eu/Hardware/Smart-Home/IKEA-ALPSTUGA . The part from the post that answers your question is this: The sensing platform used is a Sensirion SEN63C, which uses a STCC4 for CO₂ measurements. Unfortunately, this is not an NDIR sensor. Instead it uses less accurate thermal conductivity sensing. This allows building smaller/cheaper sensors, but it depends on the input of the temperature/humidity sensor, because e.g. humidity influences measurements. Also, the sensor relies on the air mixture being 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 0.93% Ar, 400 ppm CO₂ and will stop giving accurate readings when this composition changes (modulo CO₂). The operating conditions are also more limited than most other CO₂ sensors (10–40 °C, 20–80% RH). From what I could gather and what is also mentioned in the conclusion is that the sensor is fine to get a general feeling of the CO2 trends, but that you're better off getting a better sensor if you care about exact values. reply",

          "text": "Interesting. What hardware do you use to measure this? I have a Netatmo home device that measures PPM and have been observing the trend lines throughout the day. At some points my flat gets up to about 1400, which the device says is bad, and sometimes it goes down as low as 500. I've noticed a pattern but can't quite connect that pattern to my activity or the surroundings. It starts going up around 4pm, which could be homewards-bound vehicles, but it seems to trend even on weekends when there is lower traffic. Maybe I start breathing differently at these times. I'm quite interested in getting to the bottom of it. Unfortunately I'm west facing so plant use is quite limited. What is the atmospheric ambient CO2 level? Is that variable based on location? I've learnt a few things: - I had my sensor on my work desk which meant the CO2 pooled, and was increased dramatically by my breathing almost directly onto it. Moved the sensor at least 1.5m - I had the sensor quite low down, where CO2 pools (being heavier), so moved the sensor to eye level - CO2 seemed to increase when cooking (same room), so while cooking I open the windows and let the warmth flow out of the building reply",

          "text": "Same general experience. I have seen friends and former coworkers who I know are mediocre devs but good at talking themselves up get placed multiple times this year. I've secured a single interview, company seemed like a great fit. System level Go apps, my bread and butter. No longer have to split my time with frontend? The dream. On round 2 their CTO basically shut me down 2 minutes in saying they're unwilling to do any sort of training and only looking for existing experts in their very specific niche. In round 1 the interviewer told me I seemed like a very good candidate, very positive about my experience. Said they'd been looking for a long while and I was one of the most experienced Go backend developers they'd interviewed. Round 1 was frankly one of the most positive interviews I'd ever had. Got extreme whiplash as round 2 was cut short at about the ten minute mark. I don't know for sure but I think a lot of companies are looking for an absolute Cinderella given the glut in applications. I don't think that guys going to find her. It's been a couple months now, their job posting is still up. I'd have been well up to speed and making meaningful contributions by now. reply",

The few I bought weren’t certified or anything, but they have lots of very well established sellers. I got a few bronze and silver coins from the Middle East and India. They were in good shape at about $10-20 US (plus international shipping). I also got some nicer Byzantine and Roman coins in the $50 US price range. I tried to group my orders from each seller to save on shipping. So far everything I’ve gotten is exactly as pictured, and the transactions have been very smooth. I got a couple more from a local dealer. The prices were a bit higher, but he was a lot of fun to talk to, which more than makes up for the price difference. reply",

          "text": "(Yes I know the trend I’m about to talk about was different in BigTech and adjacent. I did an almost 4 year stint at a FAANG 2 years ago and have no need or desire to go back at 51.  That’s not where most developers work) Back around 2013-2014 well before AI, I saw the trend that it wasn’t going to take much to be a “good enough” enterprise “full stack” developer meaning the market was going to be commoditized and if i  was  just a “I codez good and pull tickets off the board” developer, it was going to be hard to stand out from the crowd. I was prescient, when companies reach out to me now for standard enterprise dev jobs in Atlanta (no longer live there but a large part of my network is still there) I see the same salaries I saw in 2016. I worked over the next six years to move “up the stack”.  I learned soft skills, learned AWS and how to treat it more than just a glorified Colo, learned how to lead projects, talk to the “business”, focused on business value, started getting closer to sales and how they operate etc. Out of everything I said, the take away should not be to “learn cloud”.  Everyone and their dog knows AWS (except for one niche that has opened a few doors to me). The take away is to incease the “scope and impact” of your work beyond just being a code monkey.  Also learn how to work at an increased level of ambiguity. https://www.levels.fyi/blog/swe-level-framework.html AI is just another part of the commoditization and devaluation of the generic developer.  There is no “moat” around being a generic full stack/mobile/web developer. As of 2020, I work in cloud consulting specializing in app dev.  I have been working full time for consulting departments (the internal one at AWS) and after being Amazoned in late 2023, it took me all of three weeks to have three offers.  After I made a bad choice between the three in 2023, it again took me two weeks to have an offer. I haven’t had to do a coding interview in over a decade because I know how to communicate my value and experience and I don’t try to compete on “I codez real gud”. I’m not a super special snowflake reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a big fan of Claude Opus as it has been very good at understanding feature requests and generally staying consistent with my codebase (completely written from scratch using Opus).<p>I've noticed recently that when I am using Opus at night (Eastern US), I am seeing it go down extreme rabbit holes on the same types of requests I am putting through on a regular basis. It is more likely to undertake refactors that break the code and then iterates on those errors in a sort of spiral. A request that would normally take 3-4 minutes will turn into a 10 minute adventure before I revert the changes, call out the mistake, and try again. It will happily admit the mistake, but the pattern seems to be consistent.<p>I haven't performed a like for like test and that would be interesting, but has anyone else noticed the same?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I mostly use Gemini, so I can't speak for Claude, but Gemini definitely has variable quality at different times, though I've never bothered to try to find a specific time-of-day pattern to it. The most reliable time to see it fall apart is when Google makes a public announcement that is likely to cause a sudden influx of people using it. And there are multiple levels of failure, first you start seeing iffy responses of obvious lesser quality than usual and then if things get really bad you start seeing just random errors where Gemini will suddenly lose all of its context (even on a new chat) or just start failing at the UI level by not bothering to finish answers, etc. The sort of obvious likely reason for this is when the models are under high load they probably engage in a type of dynamic load balancing where they fall back to lighter models or limit the amount of time/resources allowed for any particular prompt. reply",

Thus it's impossible for traffic spikes _not_ to cause some degradations in model performance (at least until/unless they acquire enough compute to saturate that asymptotic curve for every request under all demand conditions -- it does not seem plausible that they are anywhere close to this) reply",

The main reason was I had conflict with teammate in standup meeting. Used foul words. I later apologized in front of my entire teammates and settled it down. But still I resigned later on because I felt being let go. For example: My department was changed and later I was deemed unfit for that department as I could not learn “what they wanted” in two weeks. So my manager (first department) would tell me “Since you are unfit for this role, how do we take you back?” He did take us back but promoted juniors and kept me in the first level support.<p>To be honest I did not like that job due to the following reasons (since the start)<p>The work was menial.<p>The pay was horrible.<p>The blame was most because we were the lowest hanging fruits in entire company.<p>I wanted to prepare for government computer engineer job.<p>I could not see myself in that role for long.<p>But the reality was I could not get crack any other private sector jobs in those two plus years. I landed couple of interviews but could not get through interviews. That was when I decided government would be a better fit for my nature.<p>If I keep the gap visible in my resume, I will receive many questions(I might not be screened at all to be honest).<p>Why could not you seek a different job instead while having your existing job?<p>Why could not you seek a different department in your previous company itself?<p>I was preparing for government job since I left my job.<p>So I am looking for ideas to cover that gap.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

An individual /32 has a specific datacenter (so basically unicast). In a hypothetical world where BGP could route /32s it wouldn’t be anycast. I wasn’t precise, but what I meant was more akin to a single IP shared by multiple datacenters in different regions (from a BGP perspective), which I don’t think Cloudflare has. This is general parallel of ingress unicast as well, a single IP that can be routed to multiple destinations (even if on the BGP level, the entire aggregate is anycast). It would also not explain the OP, because they are seeing the same source IP, but from many (presumably) different source locations whereas with the Cloudflare scheme each location would have a different source IP. reply",

The reverse DNS on that page though suggests that the range is mainly full of name-servers, which would be strange to get requests from but I have no idea what cloudflare does on its network. As for the multiple datacentre thing - one IP address can be Anycast-ed to multiple actual hosts in different physical locations. For example, if I ping 173.245.58.0, I get a response in 11ms from my location here in Helsinki. At the speed of light this means travelling 3,300KM (0.011s * 3x10^8m/s) which doesn't get me anywhere near the States. So again, nothing exciting about 1 IP address coming from different locations. If you look at your raw logs - you might see some headers from cloudflare with more clues. It's interesting, but as others have mentioned, not worth worrying about. reply",
