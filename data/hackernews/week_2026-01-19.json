          "text": "I've not found it that great at programming in cobol, at least in comparison to its ability with other languages it seems to be noticeably worse, though we aren't using any models that were specifically trained on cobol. It is still useful for doing simple and tedious tasks, for example constructing a file layout based on info I fed it can be a time saver, otherwise I feel it's pretty limited by the necessary system specifics and really large context window needed to understand what is actually going on in these systems. I do really like being able to feed it a whole manual and let it act as a sort of advanced find. Working in a mainframe environment often requires looking for some obscure info, typically in a large PDF that's not always easy to find what you need, so this is pretty nice. reply",

I do love AI for writing yaml and bicep. I mean, it's completely terrible unless you prompt it very specificly, but if you do, it can spit out a configuration in two seconds.

          "text": "I’m being pushed to use it more and more at work and it’s just not that great. I have paid access to Copilot with ChatGPT and Claude for context. The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform. Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies. So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops! I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole. reply",

For the terminology, I consider \"vibe-coding\" as Claude etc. coding agents that sculpts entire blocks of code based on prompts. My use-tactic for LLM/AI-coding is to just get the signature/example of some functions that I need (because documents usually suck), and then coding it myself. That way the control/understanding is more (and very egoistically) in my hands/head, than in LLMs. I don't know what kind of projects you do, but many times the magic of LLMs ends, and the discussion just starts to go same incorrect circle when reflected on reality. At that point I need to return to use classic human intelligence. And for COBOL + AI, in my experience mentioning \"COBOL\" means that there is usually DB + UI/APP/API/BATCHJOB for interacting with it. And the DB schema + semantics is propably the most critical to understand here, because it totally defines the operations/bizlogic/interpretations for it. So any \"AI\" would also need to understand your DB (semantically) fully to not make any mistakes. But in any case, someone needs to be responsible for the committed code, because only personified human blame and guilt can eventually avert/minimize sloppiness. reply",

We have a statically generated knowledge base of the migrated sourcecode that can be used as context for LLMs to work with, but even that is often not enough to do anything meaningful. At times Opus 4.5 is able to debug small errors in COBOL modules given a stacktrace and enough hand-holding. Other models are decent at explaining semi-obscure COBOL patterns or at guessing what a module could be doing just given the name and location -- but more often than not they end up just being confidently wrong. I think the best use-case we have so far is business rule extraction - aka understanding what a module is trying to achieve without getting too much into details. The TLDR, at least in our case, is that without any supporting RAGs/finetuning/etc all kind of AI works \"just ok\" and isn't such a big deal (yet) reply",

          "text": "Given the mass of code out there, it strikes me it's only a matter of time before someone fine tunes one of the larger more competent coding models on COBOL. If they haven't already. Personally I've had a lot of luck Opus etc with \"odd\" languages just making sure that the prompt is heavily tuned to describe best practices and reinforce descriptions of differences with \"similar\" languages. A few months ago with Sonnet 4, etc. this was dicey. Now I can run Opus 4.5 on my own rather bespoke language and get mostly excellent output. Especially when it has good tooling for verification, and reference documentation available. The downside is you use quite a bit of tokens doing this. Which is where I think fine tuning could help. I bet one of the larger airlines or banks could dump some cash over to Anthropic etc to produce a custom trained model using a corpus of banking etc software, along with tools around the backend systems and so on. Worthwhile investment. In any case I can't see how this would be a threat to people who work in those domains. They'd be absolutely invaluable to understand and apply and review and improve the output. I can imagine it making their jobs 10x more pleasant though. reply",

During my years as a developer, I've often faced the skepticism surrounding automation technologies, especially when it comes to legacy languages like COBOL. There’s a perception that as AI becomes more capable, it might threaten specialized roles. However, I believe that the intricacies and context of legacy systems often require human insight that AI has yet to master fully.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">To make a preface first: I am currently located in Belgrade, Serbia and I am trying to see where I could find potential investor for the project I am working on.<p>I know the places such as OpenVC https://www.openvc.app/, but I do not know anyone that had any experience with it. I am really not sure if anyone has invested in projects from Serbia outside ElevenFund, SouthCentral Ventures and few more.<p>For someone wondering why not to look for local investments: Aside from the current political turmoil, the investment here is not that encouraging - you give away a large percent of equity for the investment that is not enough to cover yearly costs in some cases.<p>About the project: I come from the HR field, and in current climate finding job is really hard. A lot of candidates apply, and at the same time a lot of positions are saturated with applications, that most of the time are not even viewed. This in turn makes finding job even harder.<p>The traditional ATS model feels like black hole where you just throw your resume and hope for the best. With the addition of AI to analyze and pick resumes it gets even worse. Additionally, a lot of them are saturated with features which most people either don't use or know how to use at all.<p>Getting rejected from one company shouldn't be the end of the road when searching for job, it should be just the start until it is finished and concludes with hiring somewhere.<p>The idea itself is to connect applicants (with their consent) that have been rejected, with other companies that are looking for same profiles. This cuts Time To Hire saving the costs for company on the one side, and at the same time it cuts the time for people to find a job, since the system matches them with potential companies in a similar way like dating apps. It can also reduce reliance on hiring agencies as time goes by.<p>As more people use the ATS the database will get bigger, thus the quality of the matches will get better. The AI here can be used for better matchmaking and building better recommendation system, while making sure that there is human behind the feels to check every match, resume and so on.<p>I have already built an MVP that shows how it would function, and am currently in the process of working out with friend in making it to be in usable state for others. I've researched PMF (Product Market Fit) and how it fits in current market. As for the monetization I have additional ideas aside for the typical subscription payed per seat/package.<p>The product itself is B2B oriented with both the individuals and companies being the beneficiaries of it.<p>I am open to hearing more on how should I proceed in this regards and where to go next really because finding investment from Serbia seems like looking to find a needle in a haystack.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

More details about the project can be found in the README at <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme</a>.<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081</a> - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd</a>.</p></p></p></p></div>",

But the quality of submissions has been surprisingly good and I am genuinely delighted by the number of interesting websites I have came across in the last few hours. So I have gone ahead and removed the overly restrictive criteria language. > Was hoping it would be a way to stumble upon potentially underrepresented content from folks in the hacker news community who don't normally get attention.

These are companies who employ multiple small teams (think 3-4 people), and each team is charged with cloning one of the most popular apps - they have really abbreviated development cycles, on the order of 6 weeks, and they just keep churning till they've drowned every app on the leaderboard in clones.

If your business is \"a flashlight app\", yeah, eventually they'll copy it (as it happened). However they'll take an unusual long time to do that simple thing (as it also happened). Why? Because everything at big companies is a political game, full of internal conflicts, multiple priorities, non-collaborative teams, self-interest, promotion games, and a bunch of other things not really related to build the thing in question. It very rarely has anything to do with how fast the code can be written. If your business is good enough and becomes something more than \"a piece of software\", and solves a problem, becomes a brand, has great user feedback... that's not something you can \"copy in no time\". reply",

One can see this from the failure of google+ (and killing off beloved apps, like reader on its altar, when I would argue if they are thinking platform, the idea is to make any app insert data into the platform, you don't want to push away users, you want to get them using the platform with them even knowing it). Or their disjointed messaging strategy for many years (which might not even matter, they seemingly have given up on it?).  It shouldn't matter what messaging app someone uses, let it use a common platform.  Spend the money on figuring out how to make them use a common platform, because killing their app just pushes them away and you are not guaranteed that they will move to your new app vs something else.  Moving their old app to your new platform, again, keeps them as users, increases the value of the platform (as more users are inserting dfata into it) which makes it more valuable to others to do the same.  One might have different apps geared towards differ things (someone might be happy with just text messaging, another might want video and text messaging, but if you kill the first guy's app and expect him to move, he might just as quickly move to whatsapp or something else). reply",

          "text": "This seems like a very jaded comment, and if it’s because you got burned in a startup, then you have my sympathy and I’m sorry for debating. Just know that not everyone is running on nothing but greed. You might be confusing VCs with startup founders a bit. VCs are definitely profit motivated, by design. It’s going too far, and incorrect IMO, to suggest even VCs, or anyone involved, doesn’t care about building solutions or care about customers. All founders I’ve ever met care about what they make, and most VCs care about it somewhat but also care that the founders care strongly; they don’t often fund founders who don’t care. So can you source any of your claims of “most”? I just looked it up, and the majority of software startups are self-funded or angel/seed-funded, not VC funded. Founders that don’t care about product or customers enough tend to fail. Founders that only care about the payoff don’t tend to self-fund their startup. That said, everyone and all companies have financial incentives. There’s nothing unique or new about software startup founders there. The entire economy runs on profit motive. And I’ve seen a lot more people who don’t care about customers or product working in large companies making a nice easy salary working 9 to 5 (or less)! My personal sampling of founders vs company workers is that founders are, by far , the ones who care more deeply about building something new and delighting customers and growing a sustainable business, care enough to start working nights and weekends, go years with crappy pay or no pay, to do every job in the company from engineering to design to marketing to support to filing taxes. Some people certainly are at least partially motivated to accept these sacrifices for the chance at a payoff, but lots of founders would prefer a lifestyle company where they get to keep building and don’t have the insane pressures and politics of a unicorn company. Pivots are a thing because good product ideas often are not good business ideas. Startups that fail to pivot are the ones that die, and if your startup dies you don’t get to care about what you’re building or about customers at all. If you want companies to care about product and customers and not profit, then you should embrace sustainable economics, and that means making things people will pay for, and when they’re not paying, making something else. reply",

However, there is an absolute limit to how much money a company can leave on the table, regardless of what the customer wants, and serving the customer’s best interest becomes a ‘bad decision’ and threatens the ability for the company to do anything for the customer the moment it’s unprofitable, as soon as costs exceed income.

I have read the thread, thank you, and you certainly have been talking about startups and founders as if these issues are unique to them. It’s not just ‘yeah yeah big companies too’… if you actually care about and study enshittification at all, it is, by and large, entirely coming from big companies, and it isn’t new to software, it has always been happening. The only thing new is a cute term for it that got popular recently. Old business terms that mean the same thing include: loss leader, hook product, bait and switch, and plain old “promotion”. Regardless of what the topic here is, it doesn’t make sense to harp on startups over quality going down. For that to happen, it had to be higher at some point, and that point is: startups. VC funding might lead to some quality decline, but all companies trim and get worse as they grow, and always have. Startup is the phase when companies provide the highest level of product or service. reply",

Execution and distribution are the real bottlenecks. Big companies can copy your product, but they usually won’t copy:\n– your speed early on\n– your willingness to serve a tiny, unsexy niche\n– your ability to change direction without internal politics In practice, most startups don’t die because a big company copied them. They die because they never found real users who cared enough to pay. The moat today often looks like:\n– deep understanding of a specific workflow or pain point\n– trust with a narrow audience\n– compounding advantages (data, habits, integrations, community) If your plan is “build something cool and hope it sticks”, it’s probably not worth it.\nIf your plan is “solve a painful problem for a very specific group, then expand”, it still is.

Code was always cheap. But architecture, distribution, quality control, integration once landed, this is where money is mostly made. Most indie or small companies die because they just pick shitty problems. eg nobody cares about a goddamn notes app, the one on Mac works fine and most people write garbage in their notes like utter trash. So obviously a notes app has little value because the asset it manages has very little value. Not so much if you are building something like document storage for regulated industries. Or compliance software. In these cases, its the business domain expertise which counts. Even when applying for jobs without domain expertise code monkeys never get paid past a threshold. People / entities that command a premium are the ones with domain knowledge. reply",

AFAICT, moats are bigger now than ever before, but the moats I see are centered around things like consumer habits and B2B contracts and hub/platform experiences. People tend to like the software they know & have, or the contractors they know already, even when they complain about it. The need to overcome static friction is a moat, one that makes it harder for startups to get in, but easier to stay once you’re in. Big companies are slow. It seems like it would be easy for them to copy products, but they rarely do, and even when they try they take forever. Worry about yourself first, whether you can deliver, whether your product is superior, whether you can get customers, whether your business is sustainable, etc.. Worry about other startups second. They can copy faster than big companies. Do you have an edge over other startups? Don’t worry about the big companies. If they aren’t already solving the problem you want to solve, they won’t start until after you’re successful. Note acquisitions are a thing! Big companies that want to copy your product are aware that the fastest way to do that is to acquire a working solution and a pile of new customers. You should be thinking about big companies more as opportunity than competition. reply",

You can see an example comparing semantic (i.e., embeddings-based) search vs bm25 vs hybrid here: http://search-sensei.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (warning! It will download ~50MB of data for the model weights and onnx runtime on first load, but should otherwise run smoothly even on a phone) This mini app illustrates the advantage of semantic vs bm25 search. For instance, embedding models \"know\" that j lo refers to jennifer lopez.

I look forward to checking this one out! I don't know if this is too much to ask, but something that would really help me adopt your model is to include a fine-tuning setup. The BGE series of embeddings-models has been my go-to for a couple of years now -- not because it's the best-performing in the leaderboards, but because they make it so incredibly easy to fine-tune the model [0]. Give it a JSONL file of a bunch of training triplets, and you can fine-tune the base models on your own dataset. I appreciate you linking to the paper on the recipe for training this type of model -- how close to turnkey is your model to helping me do transfer learning with my own dataset? I looked around for a fine-tuning example of this model, and didn't happen to see anything, but I would be very interested in trying this one out. Does support for fine-tuning already exist? If so, then I would be able to switch to this model away from BGE immediately. * [0] - https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/tree/master/exampl... reply",

The tradeoff here is that you get even faster inference, but lose on retrieval accuracy [0]. Specifically, inference will be faster because essentially you are only doing tokenization + a lookup table + an average. So despite the fact that their largest model is 32M params, you can expect inference speeds to be higher than ours, which 23M params but it is transformer-based. I am not sure about typical inference speeds on a CPU for their models, but with ours you can expect to do ~22 docs per second, and ~120 queries per second on a standard 2vCPU server. As far as retrieval accuracy goes, on BEIR we score 53.55, all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (a widely adopted compact text embedding model) scores 42.69, while potion-8M scores 30.43. I can't find their larger models but you can generally get an idea of the power level of different embedding models here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard If you want to run them on a CPU it may make sense to filter for smaller models (e.g., <100M params).\nOn the other side our models achieve higher retrieval scores.

          "text": "For vector generation I started using Meta-LLama-3-8B in april 2024 with Python and Transformers for each text chunk on an RTX-A6000. Wow that thing was fast but noisy and also burns 500W. So a year ago I switched to an M1 Ultra and only had to replace Transformers with Apple's MLX python library. Approximately the same speed but less heat and noise. The Llama model has 4k dimensions so at fp16 thats 8 kilobyte per chunk, which I store in a BLOB column in SQLite via numpy.save(). Between running on the RTX and M1 there is a very small difference in vector output but not enough for me to change retrieval results, regenerate the vectors or change to another LLM. For retrieval I load all the vectors from the SQlite database into a numpy.array and hand it to FAISS. Faiss-gpu was impressively fast on the RTX6000 and faiss-cpu is slower on the M1 Ultra but still fast enough for my purposes (I'm firing a few queries per day, not per minute). For 5 million chunks memory usage is around 40 GB which both fit into the A6000 and easily fits into the 128GB of the M1 Ultra. It works, I'm happy. reply",

          "text": "Sure, I've managed both clusters and single node deployments in production until 2025 when I changed jobs. Elastic definitely does have its strengths, but they're increasingly enterprise-oriented and appear not to care a lot about open source deployments. At one point Elastic itself had a severe regression in an irreverible patch update (!?) which took weeks to fix, forcing us to recover from backup and recreate the index. The documentation is or has been ambigious and self-contradicting on a lot of points. The Debian Elastic Enterprise Search package upgrade script was incomplete, so there's a significant manual process for updating the index even for patch updates. The interfaces between the different components of the ELK stack are incoherent and there's literally a thousand ways to configure them. Default setups have changed a lot over the years, leading to incoherent documentation. You really need to be an expert at Elastic in order to run it well – or pay handsomely for the service. It's simply too complicated and costly for what it is, compared to more recent alternatives. reply",

This may be of interest: https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/Blended-RAG > So we'd probably find an even split of people who would call this RAG or not. Maybe but not likely. This is sometimes called the 50-50 fallacy or the false balance of probability or the equiprobability bias. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4310748/ “The equiprobability bias (EB) is a tendency to believe that every process in which randomness is involved corresponds to a fair distribution, with equal probabilities for any possible outcome. The EB is known to affect both children and adults, and to increase with probability education. Because it results in probability errors resistant to pedagogical interventions, it has been described as a deep misconception about randomness: the erroneous belief that randomness implies uniformity. In the present paper, we show that the EB is actually not the result of a conceptual error about the definition of randomness.” You can also find an ELI5 Reddit thread on this topic where one comment summarizes it as follows: “People are conflating the number of distinguishable outcomes with the distribution of probability directly.” https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1bpor68/... reply",

The real lightbulb moment is when you realise the ONLY thing a RAG passes to the LLM is a short string of search results with small chunks of text. This changes it from 'magic' to 'ahh, ok - I need better search results'. With small models you cannot pass a lot of search results ( TOP_K=5 is probably the limit ), otherwise the small models 'forget context'. It is fun trying to get decent results - and it is a rabbithole, next step I am going into is pre-summarising files and folders.

BM25 allows you to efficiently enumerate all code locations in your codebase that need to change and then you can set the cli coders off using this list.

Studies generally show when you do agentic retrieval w/ text search, that's pretty good. Adding vector retrieval and graph rag, so the typical parallel multi-retrieval followed by reranking, gives a bit of speedup and quality lift. That lines up with my local flow experience, where it is only enough that I want that for $$$$ consumer/prosumer tools, and not easy enough for DIY that I want to invest in that locally. For those who struggle with tools like spotlight running when it shouldn't, that kind of thing turns me off on the cost/benefit side. For code, I experiment with unsound tools (semgrep, ...) vs sound flow analyzers, carefully setup for the project. Basically, ai coders love to use grep/sed for global replace refactors and other global needs, but keeps tripped up on sound flow analysis. Similar to lint and type checking, that needs to be setup for a project and taught as a skill. I'm not happy with any of my experiments here yet however :( reply",

What a coding agent needs is to be able to locate portions of source code relevant to what it has been tasked with, and preferably in more context-efficient fashion than just grepping and loading entire source files into context. One way to do this is something like Cursor's vector index of code chunks, and another would be something like TreeSitter (or other identifier-based tools) that knows where identifiers (variables, functions) are defined and used. Language servers (LSP) are not useful for this task since they can't tell the agent \"where is function foo() defined\" (but TreeSitter can), since as someone else noted language servers are based on location (line number) not content (symbols). Language servers are designed to help editors. It's possible that ast-grep might be some some use to a coding agent, but looking for syntax/AST patterns rather than just identifier definitions and usages seems a much more niche facility. reply",

          "text": "We handle ~300k customer interactions per day, so latency and precision really matter. We built an internal RAG-based portal on top of our knowledge base (basically a much better FAQ). On the retrieval side, I built a custom search/indexing layer (Node) specifically for service traceability and discovery. It uses a hybrid approach — embeddings + full-text search + IVF-HNSW — to index and cross-reference our APIs, services, proxies and orchestration repos. The RAG pipelines sit on top of this layer, which gives us reasonable recall and predictable latency. Compliance and observability are still a problem. Every year new vendors show up promising audits, data lineage and observability, but none of them really handle the informational sprawl of ~600 distributed systems. The entropy keeps increasing. Lately I’ve been experimenting with a more semantic/logical KAG approach on top of knowledge graphs to map business rules scattered across those systems. The goal is to answer higher-level questions about how things actually work — Palantir-like outcomes, but with explicit logic instead of magic. Curious if others are moving beyond “pure RAG” toward graph-based or hybrid reasoning setups. reply",

You want to just hang out, you reach out and propose what you’re doing. You want more purposeful and meaningful time, join a volunteer group you vibe with. Even if it’s meeting for coffee. You have to be the one who reaches out. You have to do it on a regular cadence. If, like me, you don’t have little alarms in your head that go off when you haven’t seen someone in a while, you can use automated reminders. I have observed my spouse (who is not on social media) do this and she maintains friendships for decades this way. Nowadays she has regular zoom check ins, book clubs, and more, even with people who moved to the other coast. You do now have the tools for this. I have adopted it into my own life with good results. Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on. You are struggling against many aspects of the way we in the developed world/nerd world live. We have a wealth of passive entertainment, often we have all consuming jobs or have more time-consuming relationship with our families than our parents ever did. We move to different cities for jobs, and even as suburban sprawl has grown, you’re on average probably further away from people who even live in the same city! You get from place to place in a private box on wheels, or alternatively in a really big box on wheels with a random assortment of people. You don’t see people at church, or market day, or whatever other rituals our ancestors had. On the positive side, you have more tools and leisure than ever before to arrange more voluntary meetings. reply",

I have kept my public and official New Year’s resolutions for 37 years running. I’m up to “intentional and senseless acts of violence that end in the injury of innocents“. You may scoff, but senselessness is highly contextually dependent and can easily apply to something that seemed rational under the fog of circumstance. Thats actually not that easy to promise without forsaking the option of violence altogether, which I am not at liberty to do, since I have a family to protect. It’s a slow, intentional process. I don’t want to risk overreaching. Still, they are worthwhile goals. Low-hanging fruit is still fruit. The useful thing to me has been to expect little from people and life in general, but a lot of myself. Then be delighted when things go as they should, or when people come through. It’s a contagious positivity masquerading as cynicism, or maybe the other way around, I’m not sure… but it allows me to focus on my role in things, my choices, my actions, and reactions to the external world.  It is stoicism adjacent. The New Year’s resolutions are mostly an advertising campaign for the overall philosophy, really, by promising people easy success in something that is often a struggle, and illuminating the fact that we choose our successes and failures by how we view external circumstances, not so much by the circumstances themselves. reply",

I've always focused on the intent (why do I want to attend?) and a few crux details; everything else tends to work out or is just not that important. It seems to be one of the areas where \"fake it until you make it\" not only works but might be superior to ultra-planning. Once you've got the gist down, try and find one thing that you can go a little overboard on; it makes it very memorable. Examples: I made a big pot of home-made chili once, and another time we did (what looked like) an extravagant nacho bar. It was both better and way cheaper than typical event food. Definitely enlist an accomplice, but be aware you likely need to (appear to) be the mastermind. reply",

The social hosting skill I’ve observed and and able to do as well is extraordinarily high.  People throw parties, know how to act, are cordial and polite and seem to reasonably enjoy each others company while also teaching their children the same. This is how I remember mere middle class parents acting in the late 90s and early 2000s but my fellow millennials and z seem to be completely incapable of. One huge aspect I’ve noticed is that it’s wildly expensive in time and money to host.  An open cocktail night cost me nearly 3000 dollars to host.   I can imagine this would not be common for Gen Z these days. reply",

As something of an adult myself (I'm 46), I'm well aware of how community functions. I'm also aware of the 'keeping up with the jones' nature of wealth and how corrosive that is to community - being entirely founded on the selective and exclusive nature of spending. My contention stands, there is no need whatsoever to spend thousands on a cocktail party. One doesn't need to 'opt out' of social life. It's perfectly possible to serve cocktails yourself, to buy 'off the shelf' brands rather than expensive whiskey etc. It's perfectly possible to prepare your own food, or work with a chef who organises 'super club' style catering, which does not cost thousands. It's a choice to live this way, not a fate. And doubtless it affords status among other high worth individuals - just as it dooms you to a life of fruitless comparison and ostentatiousness. reply",

My approach around this is suggesting the idea to people up front and then throwing everyone into a WhatsApp chat and laying down the plan. Anyone who can't join gets removed/leaves. No one expects a whatsapp group to be a refined VIP experience. It's just people getting together and sharing an experience. Having moved countries and needing to start up a new friend group, things like Meetup or Facebook groups help a lot. There are _many_ people out there who are looking to meet people. For throwing a party, my general rule of thumb is expect 50% of people to turn up. reply",

So far it hasn't happened at all, they just receive our graciousness and move on immediately. reply",

          "text": "I sometimes wonder about this, I have a friend who does most of the organizing for parties or whatever. My sense is that there are a few different kinds of people, among those are people who, if they didn't organize parties, there wouldn't really be much of a platform for hanging out for them and others like them, while others are completely isolated, don't organize and don't have any other third space, and others yet have many smaller interactions from many other parts of life that don't necessitate a larger meetup necessarily. If you're an \"organizer\" type, my guess is that the people you'd hope reciprocate fall into the latter camp; they're happy to show up and have a good time, but they probably have a bunch of other things to explore that for some reason they haven't felt you'd be into... or a bunch of other possible reasons. Asking them to host a party is asking them to fabricate a social setting from thin air, but maybe they just organically don't find that to be something they need to do. For me, I'll host something for a small group if I get some inspiration, but on a week to week basis I'm often in extremely social third-spaces, supplemented by larger parties (probably bi-weekly). My effort is often best spent meeting people for deliberate, intimate, outdoor sports adventures or coffee hangouts, but the same person I know who tends to organize larger parties doesn't really feel like someone who'd be into these; they can't really hold a conversation 1 on 1 for very long, and they're not super curious or vulnerable or athletic in the way that's necessary to engage in those as much. He's a regimented, scheduled, impatient, person. They often need a sort of fabricated social vehicle (also likes to decorate and host), whereas I get nearly all of my socializing from incidentally being in social space. I think it's fine to be either of course. It's ok that my organizer friend doesn't like heights, and so I won't invite him to climb mountains, he likes hosting parties, so I try to attend as many as I can. Note that I don't mean the non-organizer (me) is just passively socializing, it's just that they have different catalysts built into the things they do that extend into socializing easily. I'm DMing 1 or 2 friends, multiple times a week, to do something we both enjoy or just chat while walking around the city. While parties and hosted things are neat, they're just not very good platforms for depth. Just as well, I do try and be inviting to everyone who'd like to come out and do other things, in general it's important to reciprocate, but I'm not hosting a party just because someone else did. reply",

Curious what others do and in what context. It makes tons of sense for a dedicated device in a work context. At home do you have a different account for say your kid?

This might be a bit much for most people. The idea is that my main personal and work accounts use exclusively open source apps, and any context which demands proprietary apps gets siloed off somewhere. Two of the user accounts have google services framework installed, but neither is logged in to the play store. The reason that the phone is more complex is that I am essentially never forced to use proprietary apps on my desktops, there has always been a way to work around it. But not so on the phone. reply",

          "text": "I found out my crimson-bellied conure is laying an egg today! She's nesting in some towels now, chirping away while she works on laying it. Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds. She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute. I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me. She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :) So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with! Birds :) reply",

          "text": "I got a handheld emulator console as a Christmas gift. Configuring shaders that emulate crt TVs, I realized I had no mental model of how those TVs worked at all. I’m used to “pixels are three little lights combining rgb colors”, which doesn’t work here, so I went on a rabbit hole and let me tell you, analog TVs are extremely impressive tech. Getting an electron beam to hit a glass, making the chemicals on it spark, covering it in a “reading motion” for hundreds of lines, and doing that 60 times a second! And the beam is oriented by just careful usage of magnets. It sounds super sci-fi for an already dead, 130 years old technology. I also learned that my childhood was a lie. Turns out that the logic in consoles of the time was tied to the speed of the beam, which in turn used alternating current’s frequency as a clock. This means that since European current changes 50 times per second rather than 60, our games played in slowmo (about 0.8x). American sonic was so much faster! And the music was so much more upbeat! reply",

Page after page was transmitted after one-another, repeatedly. It was sometimes used for subtitles, with some pages with a transparent background. Better receivers cached pages so you wouldn't have to wait for its next transmission when going to another page... Digital television formats adopted the framing from analogue formats and sends the same data in digital form within the vertical blanking interval. Many channels have stopped offering teletext. One network here in Sweden still uses it to deliver news, and I often prefer that format because the articles are concise and distraction-free. BTW.

What surprised me the most was that shiro (white) miso and aka (red) miso are both the same mix of soybeans, salt, and rice malt but fermented for different periods of time. As the miso ferments for longer, its color becomes darker while its flavor becomes milder and more complex. Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic. After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Most miso you can buy in a grocery store is created through forced fermentation over a few months, so if you ever get a chance to try naturally aged miso I would highly recommend! reply",

Syrah - red grape, red wine.\n7. Grenache Noir - red grape, red wine.\n8. Sauvignon Blanc - white grape, white wine.\n9. Pinot Noir - red grape, red wine.\n10. Trebbiano Toscano / Ugni Blanc - white grape, white wine. There are some wines which are produced with red grapes which are not left on skins so there is no impartation of red colour, but they are really not common and the result is most of the time a bit closer to a light rose than what would be considered a white wine. Perhaps the only style that would be semi-frequently encountered are some French Blanc de Noirs wines, various champagne examples being the most common of these. (And of course standard champagne itself, but I am not sure if that is really considered a white wine). Still, rare. It is also not possible to produce a red wine with a white grape, there is no colour in the skin to impart. [0]: https://londonwinecompetition.com/en/blog/insights-1/how-the... reply",

My ICE propelled two wheel journey started only about a year ago with a 50cc moped, but I've since graduated to 125cc (mostly because I learned that here in Portugal, with the licence for a car, I can drive up to 125cc (in my country the limit is 50cc, which is why I started there)). The moped was second hand SYM Jet 14, but the 125cc that I got was a brand new Honda CB125F, the very newest of models. It's incredibly fun and since I mostly use it to go to work and back everyday, it's more than enough. In the post titled \"Buying an unseen 1959 Triumph Bonneville T120\", at the start there's a typo: \"A lot of people wanted Harleys – but for some reason they just did spark anything in me.\" This is probably just my personal error, but whenever I see Triumph bikes, I can't help but think about underwear brand Triumph (which are of very high quality, I've got a few, would recommend), I haven't tried any Triumph bikes but I do want to one day! reply",

It's rather easy with physical books (or was, as we have little room left for even more books ;-0) but ebooks are  \"dangerous\" too. Regarding cameras, it's harder (and more expensive) to wrangle with gear acquisition syndrome (GAS) but after switching from Canon EOS to Fuji, because the Canon stuff was too heavy when hiking, I managed to restrain myself most of the time. Because the question always is whether my images would become better with different gear or with more trial and error. I opted for trial and error and eagerly watch a selected number of YouTube channels who almost always show me that I  should and can improve myself and not my gear. reply",

          "text": "Thanks a lot! Yes, I agree that it is easier with physical books although even there I can already see that I may be painting myself into a corner. But ebooks are obviously \"worse\" in that regard. I loved when I found StandardEbooks.org and Gutenberg - all these classic books for free. But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing. With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself. There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those \"perfect\" images. When in fact nothing is keeping me from going out and shooting those \"perfect\" images with the camera I already have. reply",

          "text": "I was able to find this blog post of a deep-dive into the ALPSTUGA: https://danieldk.eu/Hardware/Smart-Home/IKEA-ALPSTUGA . The part from the post that answers your question is this: The sensing platform used is a Sensirion SEN63C, which uses a STCC4 for CO₂ measurements. Unfortunately, this is not an NDIR sensor. Instead it uses less accurate thermal conductivity sensing. This allows building smaller/cheaper sensors, but it depends on the input of the temperature/humidity sensor, because e.g. humidity influences measurements. Also, the sensor relies on the air mixture being 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 0.93% Ar, 400 ppm CO₂ and will stop giving accurate readings when this composition changes (modulo CO₂). The operating conditions are also more limited than most other CO₂ sensors (10–40 °C, 20–80% RH). From what I could gather and what is also mentioned in the conclusion is that the sensor is fine to get a general feeling of the CO2 trends, but that you're better off getting a better sensor if you care about exact values. reply",

          "text": "Interesting. What hardware do you use to measure this? I have a Netatmo home device that measures PPM and have been observing the trend lines throughout the day. At some points my flat gets up to about 1400, which the device says is bad, and sometimes it goes down as low as 500. I've noticed a pattern but can't quite connect that pattern to my activity or the surroundings. It starts going up around 4pm, which could be homewards-bound vehicles, but it seems to trend even on weekends when there is lower traffic. Maybe I start breathing differently at these times. I'm quite interested in getting to the bottom of it. Unfortunately I'm west facing so plant use is quite limited. What is the atmospheric ambient CO2 level? Is that variable based on location? I've learnt a few things: - I had my sensor on my work desk which meant the CO2 pooled, and was increased dramatically by my breathing almost directly onto it. Moved the sensor at least 1.5m - I had the sensor quite low down, where CO2 pools (being heavier), so moved the sensor to eye level - CO2 seemed to increase when cooking (same room), so while cooking I open the windows and let the warmth flow out of the building reply",

          "text": "Same general experience. I have seen friends and former coworkers who I know are mediocre devs but good at talking themselves up get placed multiple times this year. I've secured a single interview, company seemed like a great fit. System level Go apps, my bread and butter. No longer have to split my time with frontend? The dream. On round 2 their CTO basically shut me down 2 minutes in saying they're unwilling to do any sort of training and only looking for existing experts in their very specific niche. In round 1 the interviewer told me I seemed like a very good candidate, very positive about my experience. Said they'd been looking for a long while and I was one of the most experienced Go backend developers they'd interviewed. Round 1 was frankly one of the most positive interviews I'd ever had. Got extreme whiplash as round 2 was cut short at about the ten minute mark. I don't know for sure but I think a lot of companies are looking for an absolute Cinderella given the glut in applications. I don't think that guys going to find her. It's been a couple months now, their job posting is still up. I'd have been well up to speed and making meaningful contributions by now. reply",

The few I bought weren’t certified or anything, but they have lots of very well established sellers. I got a few bronze and silver coins from the Middle East and India. They were in good shape at about $10-20 US (plus international shipping). I also got some nicer Byzantine and Roman coins in the $50 US price range. I tried to group my orders from each seller to save on shipping. So far everything I’ve gotten is exactly as pictured, and the transactions have been very smooth. I got a couple more from a local dealer. The prices were a bit higher, but he was a lot of fun to talk to, which more than makes up for the price difference. reply",

          "text": "(Yes I know the trend I’m about to talk about was different in BigTech and adjacent. I did an almost 4 year stint at a FAANG 2 years ago and have no need or desire to go back at 51.  That’s not where most developers work) Back around 2013-2014 well before AI, I saw the trend that it wasn’t going to take much to be a “good enough” enterprise “full stack” developer meaning the market was going to be commoditized and if i  was  just a “I codez good and pull tickets off the board” developer, it was going to be hard to stand out from the crowd. I was prescient, when companies reach out to me now for standard enterprise dev jobs in Atlanta (no longer live there but a large part of my network is still there) I see the same salaries I saw in 2016. I worked over the next six years to move “up the stack”.  I learned soft skills, learned AWS and how to treat it more than just a glorified Colo, learned how to lead projects, talk to the “business”, focused on business value, started getting closer to sales and how they operate etc. Out of everything I said, the take away should not be to “learn cloud”.  Everyone and their dog knows AWS (except for one niche that has opened a few doors to me). The take away is to incease the “scope and impact” of your work beyond just being a code monkey.  Also learn how to work at an increased level of ambiguity. https://www.levels.fyi/blog/swe-level-framework.html AI is just another part of the commoditization and devaluation of the generic developer.  There is no “moat” around being a generic full stack/mobile/web developer. As of 2020, I work in cloud consulting specializing in app dev.  I have been working full time for consulting departments (the internal one at AWS) and after being Amazoned in late 2023, it took me all of three weeks to have three offers.  After I made a bad choice between the three in 2023, it again took me two weeks to have an offer. I haven’t had to do a coding interview in over a decade because I know how to communicate my value and experience and I don’t try to compete on “I codez real gud”. I’m not a super special snowflake reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a big fan of Claude Opus as it has been very good at understanding feature requests and generally staying consistent with my codebase (completely written from scratch using Opus).<p>I've noticed recently that when I am using Opus at night (Eastern US), I am seeing it go down extreme rabbit holes on the same types of requests I am putting through on a regular basis. It is more likely to undertake refactors that break the code and then iterates on those errors in a sort of spiral. A request that would normally take 3-4 minutes will turn into a 10 minute adventure before I revert the changes, call out the mistake, and try again. It will happily admit the mistake, but the pattern seems to be consistent.<p>I haven't performed a like for like test and that would be interesting, but has anyone else noticed the same?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I mostly use Gemini, so I can't speak for Claude, but Gemini definitely has variable quality at different times, though I've never bothered to try to find a specific time-of-day pattern to it. The most reliable time to see it fall apart is when Google makes a public announcement that is likely to cause a sudden influx of people using it. And there are multiple levels of failure, first you start seeing iffy responses of obvious lesser quality than usual and then if things get really bad you start seeing just random errors where Gemini will suddenly lose all of its context (even on a new chat) or just start failing at the UI level by not bothering to finish answers, etc. The sort of obvious likely reason for this is when the models are under high load they probably engage in a type of dynamic load balancing where they fall back to lighter models or limit the amount of time/resources allowed for any particular prompt. reply",

Thus it's impossible for traffic spikes _not_ to cause some degradations in model performance (at least until/unless they acquire enough compute to saturate that asymptotic curve for every request under all demand conditions -- it does not seem plausible that they are anywhere close to this) reply",

The main reason was I had conflict with teammate in standup meeting. Used foul words. I later apologized in front of my entire teammates and settled it down. But still I resigned later on because I felt being let go. For example: My department was changed and later I was deemed unfit for that department as I could not learn “what they wanted” in two weeks. So my manager (first department) would tell me “Since you are unfit for this role, how do we take you back?” He did take us back but promoted juniors and kept me in the first level support.<p>To be honest I did not like that job due to the following reasons (since the start)<p>The work was menial.<p>The pay was horrible.<p>The blame was most because we were the lowest hanging fruits in entire company.<p>I wanted to prepare for government computer engineer job.<p>I could not see myself in that role for long.<p>But the reality was I could not get crack any other private sector jobs in those two plus years. I landed couple of interviews but could not get through interviews. That was when I decided government would be a better fit for my nature.<p>If I keep the gap visible in my resume, I will receive many questions(I might not be screened at all to be honest).<p>Why could not you seek a different job instead while having your existing job?<p>Why could not you seek a different department in your previous company itself?<p>I was preparing for government job since I left my job.<p>So I am looking for ideas to cover that gap.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

An individual /32 has a specific datacenter (so basically unicast). In a hypothetical world where BGP could route /32s it wouldn’t be anycast. I wasn’t precise, but what I meant was more akin to a single IP shared by multiple datacenters in different regions (from a BGP perspective), which I don’t think Cloudflare has. This is general parallel of ingress unicast as well, a single IP that can be routed to multiple destinations (even if on the BGP level, the entire aggregate is anycast). It would also not explain the OP, because they are seeing the same source IP, but from many (presumably) different source locations whereas with the Cloudflare scheme each location would have a different source IP. reply",

The reverse DNS on that page though suggests that the range is mainly full of name-servers, which would be strange to get requests from but I have no idea what cloudflare does on its network. As for the multiple datacentre thing - one IP address can be Anycast-ed to multiple actual hosts in different physical locations. For example, if I ping 173.245.58.0, I get a response in 11ms from my location here in Helsinki. At the speed of light this means travelling 3,300KM (0.011s * 3x10^8m/s) which doesn't get me anywhere near the States. So again, nothing exciting about 1 IP address coming from different locations. If you look at your raw logs - you might see some headers from cloudflare with more clues. It's interesting, but as others have mentioned, not worth worrying about. reply",

The issue is that it's usually faster to just read the documentation and write the code yourself. Depending on what you're working on of course. Like with the yaml, a LLM can write you an ingress config in a second or two from a very short prompt. It can do similar things with Python if you specify exactly how you want something and what dependencies you want. That's being bad at programming in my opinion. You can mitigate it a lot with how you config you agents. Mine loads our tech stack. The best practices we've decided to use. The fact that I value safety first but am otherwise a fan of the YAGNI philosophy and so on. I spent a little time and build these things into my personal agent on our enterprise AI plan, and I use it a lot. I still have to watch it like a hawk, but I do think it's a great tool. I guess you could say that your standard LLM will write better Python than I did 10 years ago, but that's not really good enough when you work on systems which can't fail.

LLMs seem to degrade a lot when they are forced to work on existing code bases (even their own). What seems to be more a issue with context sizes growing out of control way too fast (and this is what degrades LLMs the most). So far Opus 4.5 has been the one LLM that keeps mostly coding in a, how to say, predictable way even with a existing code base. It requires scaffolding and being very clear with your coding requests. But not like the older models where they go off script way too much or rewrite code in their own style. For me Opus 4.5 has reached that sweet spot of productivity and not just playing around with LLMs and undoing mistakes. The problem with LLMs is a lot of times a mix of LLM issues, people giving different requests, context overload, different models doing better with different languages, the amount of data it needs to alter etc... This makes the results very mixed from one person to another, and harder to quantify. Even the different in a task makes the difference between a person one day glorifying a LLM and a few weeks later complaining it was nerfed, when it was not.

I start every new feature w/Claude Code in plan mode. I give it the first step, point it to relevant source files, and tell it to generate a plan.  I go catch up on my Slack messages. I check back in and iterate on the plan until I’m happy, then tell it to implement. I go to a team meeting. I come back and review all the code. Anything I don’t 100% understand I ask Gemini to explain. I cross-check with primary sources if it’s important. I tweak the generated code by hand (faster than talking with the agent), then switch back to plan mode and ask for specific tests. I almost always need to clean up the tests for doing way too much manual setup, despite a lot of Claude.md instructions to the contrary. In the end, I probably get the work done in 30% less wall-clock time of Claude implementing (counting plan time), but I’m also doing other things while the agent crunches. Maybe 50% speed boost in total productivity? I also learn something new on about a third of features, which is way more than I did before. reply",

The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform. Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies. So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops! I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole. reply",

Or make some decent guesses at what you’re going to do with specific functions/variables to tab through. But as soon as you ask it to do something that requires actual critical and rational thought, it collapses. Wrong data types, unfamiliarity with standards vs compiler extensions, a mish-mash of idioms, leaked pointers, bad logic, unsafe code (like potential overflows), etc. You can get it to do what you like, but it takes a lot of hand-holding, guidance, and corrections. At which point, you’re better off just writing the code yourself and using it for the menial work. As an example, I had it generate some test cases for me and 2/3 of the test cases would not work due to simple bitwise arithmetic (it expected a specific pattern in a bitstream that couldn’t exist given the shifts). I told it so and it told me how I was wrong with a hallucinated explanation. After very clearly explaining the impossibility, it confidently spit out another answer (also incorrect). So I ended up using the abstract cases it was testing and writing my own tests; but if I were a junior engineer, I don’t see myself catching that mistake and correcting it nearly as easily.

          "text": "It occurs to me that \"write a C program that [problem description]\" is an extremely under-constrained task. People are highly aware that C++ programmers are always using some particular subset of C++; but it's not as obvious that any actual C programmer is actually going to use a particular dialect on top of C. Since the C standard library is so anemic for algorithms and data structures, any given \"C programmer\" is going to have a hash map of choice, a b-tree of choice, a streams abstraction of choice, an async abstraction of choice, etc. And, in any project they create, they're going to depend on (or vendor in) those low-level libraries. Meanwhile, any big framework-ish library (GTK, OpenMP, OpenSSL) is also going to have its own set of built-in data structures that you have to use to interact with it (because it needs to take and return such data-structures in its API, and it has to define them in order to do that.) Which often makes it feel more correct, in such C projects, to use that framework's abstractions throughout your own code, rather than also bringing your own favorite ones and constantly hitting the impedance wall of FFI-ing between them. It's actually shocking that, in both FOSS and hiring, we expect \"experienced C programmers\" who've worked for 99% of their careers with a dialect of C consisting of abstractions from libraries E+F+G, to also be able to jump onto C codebases that instead use abstractions from libraries W+X+Y+Z (that may depend on entirely different usage patterns for their safety guarantees!), look around a bit, and immediately be productively contributing. It's no wonder an AI can't do that. Humans can barely do it! My guess is that the performance of an AI coding agent on a greenfield C project would massively improve if you initially prompt it (or instruct it in an AGENTS.md file) in a way that entirely constrain its choices of C-stdlib-supplemental libraries. Either by explicitly listing them; or by just saying e.g. \"Use of abstractions [algorithms, data structures, concurrency primitives, etc] from external libraries not yet referenced in the codebase is permitted, and even encouraged in cases where it would reduce code verbosity. Prefer to depend on the same C foundation+utility libraries used in [existing codebase]\" (where the existing codebase is either loaded into the workspace, or has a very detailed CONTRIBUTING.md you can point the agent at.) reply",

I designed and built the front-end (windows applications, a telephone banking system, and a home-banking web thing) and middle-tier systems (VB.NET-based services). The real back-end, though, was  an old COBOL system. I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language. I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong). reply",

So you have Java code, generating COBOL code, that's then run on an emulator emulating an old IBM system that was meant to run COBOL. It's just wild . Some of the tools are even front-facing users (bank employees): at times you can still see at some banks an employee running an app in a monochrome green-on-black text terminal emulator that is basically COBOL. It's weird, just weird. But legacy code is legacy code. And if you think COBOL's legacy is bad, Java is going to dwarf COBOL's legacy big times (for Java is typically used at the kind of places that still use COBOL and it's used way more than COBOL). So in the future, heck, we may have a new language, generating, inside an emulator emulating current machines/OSes, Java code that is going to be code generating COBOL code (!), that's then going to be run in an emulator. reply",

I am putting together a community-maintained directory of personal websites at <a href=\"https://hnpwd.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hnpwd.github.io/</a>.  More details about the project can be found in the README at <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd#readme</a>.<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081</a> - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: <a href=\"https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd</a>.</p></p></p></p></div>",

Yes, I was not entirely happy with the restrictive wording either.  The original requirement was added mainly out of concern about spam submissions (blogspam, AI-generated content and similar).  But the quality of submissions has been surprisingly good and I am genuinely delighted by the number of interesting websites I have came across in the last few hours. So I have gone ahead and removed the overly restrictive criteria language. > Was hoping it would be a way to stumble upon potentially underrepresented content from folks in the hacker news community who don't normally get attention.

If my writing is to be better than LLMs I need to hone it by writing more. I'm proud of the website as well. I have used LLMs to assist with the UI dev. It has all 100s from PageSpeed. I've made it so it's easy to add pages within. All the books I've read in the last few years [1] and a minimalist gym tracker I use myself (any anyone can too!).

Oftentimes I find that in reading an explanation or report that ChatGPT gives me about a topic there will be small turns of phrase or even whole sentences that capture a concept way better than I can. I then feel obstinate not using a clearly superior option, so I'm curious if you've run into that tension and if so how you navigate it. reply",

These are companies who employ multiple small teams (think 3-4 people), and each team is charged with cloning one of the most popular apps - they have really abbreviated development cycles, on the order of 6 weeks, and they just keep churning till they've drowned every app on the leaderboard in clones.

One can see this from the failure of google+ (and killing off beloved apps, like reader on its altar, when I would argue if they are thinking platform, the idea is to make any app insert data into the platform, you don't want to push away users, you want to get them using the platform with them even knowing it). Or their disjointed messaging strategy for many years (which might not even matter, they seemingly have given up on it?).  It shouldn't matter what messaging app someone uses, let it use a common platform.  Spend the money on figuring out how to make them use a common platform, because killing their app just pushes them away and you are not guaranteed that they will move to your new app vs something else.  Moving their old app to your new platform, again, keeps them as users, increases the value of the platform (as more users are inserting dfata into it) which makes it more valuable to others to do the same.  One might have different apps geared towards differ things (someone might be happy with just text messaging, another might want video and text messaging, but if you kill the first guy's app and expect him to move, he might just as quickly move to whatsapp or something else). reply",

Because humans will always have challenges to address, software will remain a vital tool. While AI makes writing software much easier. It's likely to lead to an explosion of new apps. Only those that fill a genuine need will survive. Your job is to identify these new problems and determine which apps to build. Simple apps are a thing of the past. If an LLM can generate an app in a few sittings, it isn't a saleable product. However, people will still pay for a fully engineered application that solves a complex problem that AI cannot easily replicate. Regarding copies, there is always room for more than one solution to the same need. Your challenge is to figure out how to stand out. A fundamental business hurdle, that has existed since the beginning. Here's an idea that always bear's fruit. We humans love to do things as easy as possible. Write something that saves energy, time and is simple then people will pay for it. reply",

          "text": "This seems like a very jaded comment, and if it’s because you got burned in a startup, then you have my sympathy and I’m sorry for debating. Just know that not everyone is running on nothing but greed. You might be confusing VCs with startup founders a bit. VCs are definitely profit motivated, by design. It’s going too far, and incorrect IMO, to suggest even VCs, or anyone involved, doesn’t care about building solutions or care about customers. All founders I’ve ever met care about what they make, and most VCs care about it somewhat but also care that the founders care strongly; they don’t often fund founders who don’t care. So can you source any of your claims of “most”? I just looked it up, and the majority of software startups are self-funded or angel/seed-funded, not VC funded. Founders that don’t care about product or customers enough tend to fail. Founders that only care about the payoff don’t tend to self-fund their startup. That said, everyone and all companies have financial incentives. There’s nothing unique or new about software startup founders there. The entire economy runs on profit motive. And I’ve seen a lot more people who don’t care about customers or product working in large companies making a nice easy salary working 9 to 5 (or less)! My personal sampling of founders vs company workers is that founders are, by far , the ones who care more deeply about building something new and delighting customers and growing a sustainable business, care enough to start working nights and weekends, go years with crappy pay or no pay, to do every job in the company from engineering to design to marketing to support to filing taxes. Some people certainly are at least partially motivated to accept these sacrifices for the chance at a payoff, but lots of founders would prefer a lifestyle company where they get to keep building and don’t have the insane pressures and politics of a unicorn company. Pivots are a thing because good product ideas often are not good business ideas. Startups that fail to pivot are the ones that die, and if your startup dies you don’t get to care about what you’re building or about customers at all. If you want companies to care about product and customers and not profit, then you should embrace sustainable economics, and that means making things people will pay for, and when they’re not paying, making something else. reply",

The only thing new is a cute term for it that got popular recently. Old business terms that mean the same thing include: loss leader, hook product, bait and switch, and plain old “promotion”. Regardless of what the topic here is, it doesn’t make sense to harp on startups over quality going down. For that to happen, it had to be higher at some point, and that point is: startups. VC funding might lead to some quality decline, but all companies trim and get worse as they grow, and always have.

I understand that you might want to “use software” in the startup but surely, in the most successful startups, the thing that makes them successful is that they solve a real problem, that real people/businesses have, and are prepared to “pay” [1] you to solve for them. If the startup is just “software for the sake of software” then I think that’s a different thing entirely. And to be fair, sometimes software for the sake of it is more like art or fun. And it’s true, sometimes something wonderful comes out of that. Sometimes. :) [1]: Obviously “pay” can mean _very_ different things in different contexts. reply",

Execution and distribution are the real bottlenecks. Big companies can copy your product, but they usually won’t copy:\n– your speed early on\n– your willingness to serve a tiny, unsexy niche\n– your ability to change direction without internal politics In practice, most startups don’t die because a big company copied them. They die because they never found real users who cared enough to pay. The moat today often looks like:\n– deep understanding of a specific workflow or pain point\n– trust with a narrow audience\n– compounding advantages (data, habits, integrations, community) If your plan is “build something cool and hope it sticks”, it’s probably not worth it.\nIf your plan is “solve a painful problem for a very specific group, then expand”, it still is.

Most indie or small companies die because they just pick shitty problems. eg nobody cares about a goddamn notes app, the one on Mac works fine and most people write garbage in their notes like utter trash. So obviously a notes app has little value because the asset it manages has very little value. Not so much if you are building something like document storage for regulated industries.

AFAICT, moats are bigger now than ever before, but the moats I see are centered around things like consumer habits and B2B contracts and hub/platform experiences. People tend to like the software they know & have, or the contractors they know already, even when they complain about it. The need to overcome static friction is a moat, one that makes it harder for startups to get in, but easier to stay once you’re in. Big companies are slow. It seems like it would be easy for them to copy products, but they rarely do, and even when they try they take forever. Worry about yourself first, whether you can deliver, whether your product is superior, whether you can get customers, whether your business is sustainable, etc.. Worry about other startups second. They can copy faster than big companies. Do you have an edge over other startups? Don’t worry about the big companies. If they aren’t already solving the problem you want to solve, they won’t start until after you’re successful. Note acquisitions are a thing! Big companies that want to copy your product are aware that the fastest way to do that is to acquire a working solution and a pile of new customers. You should be thinking about big companies more as opportunity than competition. reply",

          "text": "There's a few problems, at least in the US: 1. Hyper-perfect social media / television setting \"the best\" expectations for an event. 2. Decreased knowledge of how to host a gathering. It's not rocket science, but throwing one the first time can seem daunting. And throwing one well does take skill. E.g. icebreakers, identifying and facilitating the right introductions by highlighting mutual interests, making sure wallflowers have a good time, defusing tensions, food, etc. 3. Decreased American tolerance for and ability to handle awkwardness, and there's always going to be some awkwardness in social interactions. 4. Decreased public/accessible American meeting places. There used to (< 2000) be a plethora of low-cost, broadly-accessible spaces that could serve as training wheels for events (handling food, furnishings, cleaning, etc). They've essentially all been privatized, commercialized, and optimized to turn seats -- think real coffee shops disappearing in favor of Starbucks. reply",

          "text": "I mean, it is kind of a bit, in a way, but I really did announce to my social group my resolution, about 40 years ago, and I’ve been ratcheting it up gradually ever since. I have kept my public and official New Year’s resolutions for 37 years running. I’m up to “intentional and senseless acts of violence that end in the injury of innocents“. You may scoff, but senselessness is highly contextually dependent and can easily apply to something that seemed rational under the fog of circumstance. Thats actually not that easy to promise without forsaking the option of violence altogether, which I am not at liberty to do, since I have a family to protect. It’s a slow, intentional process. I don’t want to risk overreaching. Still, they are worthwhile goals. Low-hanging fruit is still fruit. The useful thing to me has been to expect little from people and life in general, but a lot of myself. Then be delighted when things go as they should, or when people come through. It’s a contagious positivity masquerading as cynicism, or maybe the other way around, I’m not sure… but it allows me to focus on my role in things, my choices, my actions, and reactions to the external world.  It is stoicism adjacent. The New Year’s resolutions are mostly an advertising campaign for the overall philosophy, really, by promising people easy success in something that is often a struggle, and illuminating the fact that we choose our successes and failures by how we view external circumstances, not so much by the circumstances themselves. reply",

It seems to be one of the areas where \"fake it until you make it\" not only works but might be superior to ultra-planning. Once you've got the gist down, try and find one thing that you can go a little overboard on; it makes it very memorable. Examples: I made a big pot of home-made chili once, and another time we did (what looked like) an extravagant nacho bar. It was both better and way cheaper than typical event food.

This is how I remember mere middle class parents acting in the late 90s and early 2000s but my fellow millennials and z seem to be completely incapable of. One huge aspect I’ve noticed is that it’s wildly expensive in time and money to host.  An open cocktail night cost me nearly 3000 dollars to host.

A very wealthy individual might not know about the $1.50 Costco dog, and a less wealthy individual won't know about the $10,000 bottle of cab sauv (okay I'm making that up, I don't know either, but you get the point). If you have $100k you'll make do with that, if you have 10x more, most people will find ways to scale the expenses accordingly.

As something of an adult myself (I'm 46), I'm well aware of how community functions. I'm also aware of the 'keeping up with the jones' nature of wealth and how corrosive that is to community - being entirely founded on the selective and exclusive nature of spending. My contention stands, there is no need whatsoever to spend thousands on a cocktail party. One doesn't need to 'opt out' of social life. It's perfectly possible to serve cocktails yourself, to buy 'off the shelf' brands rather than expensive whiskey etc. It's perfectly possible to prepare your own food, or work with a chef who organises 'super club' style catering, which does not cost thousands. It's a choice to live this way, not a fate. And doubtless it affords status among other high worth individuals - just as it dooms you to a life of fruitless comparison and ostentatiousness. reply",

          "text": "I sometimes wonder about this, I have a friend who does most of the organizing for parties or whatever. My sense is that there are a few different kinds of people, among those are people who, if they didn't organize parties, there wouldn't really be much of a platform for hanging out for them and others like them, while others are completely isolated, don't organize and don't have any other third space, and others yet have many smaller interactions from many other parts of life that don't necessitate a larger meetup necessarily. If you're an \"organizer\" type, my guess is that the people you'd hope reciprocate fall into the latter camp; they're happy to show up and have a good time, but they probably have a bunch of other things to explore that for some reason they haven't felt you'd be into... or a bunch of other possible reasons. Asking them to host a party is asking them to fabricate a social setting from thin air, but maybe they just organically don't find that to be something they need to do. For me, I'll host something for a small group if I get some inspiration, but on a week to week basis I'm often in extremely social third-spaces, supplemented by larger parties (probably bi-weekly). My effort is often best spent meeting people for deliberate, intimate, outdoor sports adventures or coffee hangouts, but the same person I know who tends to organize larger parties doesn't really feel like someone who'd be into these; they can't really hold a conversation 1 on 1 for very long, and they're not super curious or vulnerable or athletic in the way that's necessary to engage in those as much. He's a regimented, scheduled, impatient, person. They often need a sort of fabricated social vehicle (also likes to decorate and host), whereas I get nearly all of my socializing from incidentally being in social space. I think it's fine to be either of course. It's ok that my organizer friend doesn't like heights, and so I won't invite him to climb mountains, he likes hosting parties, so I try to attend as many as I can. Note that I don't mean the non-organizer (me) is just passively socializing, it's just that they have different catalysts built into the things they do that extend into socializing easily. I'm DMing 1 or 2 friends, multiple times a week, to do something we both enjoy or just chat while walking around the city. While parties and hosted things are neat, they're just not very good platforms for depth. Just as well, I do try and be inviting to everyone who'd like to come out and do other things, in general it's important to reciprocate, but I'm not hosting a party just because someone else did. reply",

Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds. She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute. I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me. She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :) So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with! Birds :) reply",

          "text": "I got a handheld emulator console as a Christmas gift. Configuring shaders that emulate crt TVs, I realized I had no mental model of how those TVs worked at all. I’m used to “pixels are three little lights combining rgb colors”, which doesn’t work here, so I went on a rabbit hole and let me tell you, analog TVs are extremely impressive tech. Getting an electron beam to hit a glass, making the chemicals on it spark, covering it in a “reading motion” for hundreds of lines, and doing that 60 times a second! And the beam is oriented by just careful usage of magnets. It sounds super sci-fi for an already dead, 130 years old technology. I also learned that my childhood was a lie. Turns out that the logic in consoles of the time was tied to the speed of the beam, which in turn used alternating current’s frequency as a clock. This means that since European current changes 50 times per second rather than 60, our games played in slowmo (about 0.8x). American sonic was so much faster! And the music was so much more upbeat! reply",

Page after page was transmitted after one-another, repeatedly. It was sometimes used for subtitles, with some pages with a transparent background. Better receivers cached pages so you wouldn't have to wait for its next transmission when going to another page... Digital television formats adopted the framing from analogue formats and sends the same data in digital form within the vertical blanking interval. Many channels have stopped offering teletext. One network here in Sweden still uses it to deliver news, and I often prefer that format because the articles are concise and distraction-free. BTW.

What surprised me the most was that shiro (white) miso and aka (red) miso are both the same mix of soybeans, salt, and rice malt but fermented for different periods of time. As the miso ferments for longer, its color becomes darker while its flavor becomes milder and more complex. Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic. After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Most miso you can buy in a grocery store is created through forced fermentation over a few months, so if you ever get a chance to try naturally aged miso I would highly recommend! reply",

Of the top 10 planted wine varietals in the world [0], all ten are red grapes to red wine or white grapes to white wine: Top grape varieties by planted hectares\n1. Cabernet Sauvignon - red grape, red wine.\n2. Merlot - red grape, red wine.\n3. Tempranillo - red grape, red wine.\n4. Airén - white grape, white wine.\n5. Chardonnay - white grape, white wine.\n6. Syrah - red grape, red wine.\n7. Grenache Noir - red grape, red wine.\n8. Sauvignon Blanc - white grape, white wine.\n9. Pinot Noir - red grape, red wine.\n10. Trebbiano Toscano / Ugni Blanc - white grape, white wine. There are some wines which are produced with red grapes which are not left on skins so there is no impartation of red colour, but they are really not common and the result is most of the time a bit closer to a light rose than what would be considered a white wine. Perhaps the only style that would be semi-frequently encountered are some French Blanc de Noirs wines, various champagne examples being the most common of these. (And of course standard champagne itself, but I am not sure if that is really considered a white wine). Still, rare. It is also not possible to produce a red wine with a white grape, there is no colour in the skin to impart. [0]: https://londonwinecompetition.com/en/blog/insights-1/how-the... reply",

Instead of consuming other peoples interpretation of stoicism I decided to go as close to the source as feasible for me. I have read Letters from a stoic a number of times before and my copy is filled with highlights, but this time I think I will try to limit myself to one or two letters a day and then really think about them properly. The first one really hit me hard and prompted me to write out my own thoughts ( https://jesperreiche.com/seneca-letter-2/ ) whether I will keep doing that I am a little unsure. It feels on the border of how personal I want to be/share on my blog. P.S. I can see the irony in writing about me going to the source instead of consuming other peoples interpretation and then sharing a link to my own interpretation :) reply",

          "text": "Completely off-topic, but I can't help but share my joy of discovering a fellow motorcycle enjoyer. My ICE propelled two wheel journey started only about a year ago with a 50cc moped, but I've since graduated to 125cc (mostly because I learned that here in Portugal, with the licence for a car, I can drive up to 125cc (in my country the limit is 50cc, which is why I started there)). The moped was second hand SYM Jet 14, but the 125cc that I got was a brand new Honda CB125F, the very newest of models. It's incredibly fun and since I mostly use it to go to work and back everyday, it's more than enough. In the post titled \"Buying an unseen 1959 Triumph Bonneville T120\", at the start there's a typo: \"A lot of people wanted Harleys – but for some reason they just did spark anything in me.\" This is probably just my personal error, but whenever I see Triumph bikes, I can't help but think about underwear brand Triumph (which are of very high quality, I've got a few, would recommend), I haven't tried any Triumph bikes but I do want to one day! reply",

It's rather easy with physical books (or was, as we have little room left for even more books ;-0) but ebooks are  \"dangerous\" too. Regarding cameras, it's harder (and more expensive) to wrangle with gear acquisition syndrome (GAS) but after switching from Canon EOS to Fuji, because the Canon stuff was too heavy when hiking, I managed to restrain myself most of the time. Because the question always is whether my images would become better with different gear or with more trial and error. I opted for trial and error and eagerly watch a selected number of YouTube channels who almost always show me that I  should and can improve myself and not my gear. reply",

But ebooks are obviously \"worse\" in that regard. I loved when I found StandardEbooks.org and Gutenberg - all these classic books for free. But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing. With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself. There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those \"perfect\" images. When in fact nothing is keeping me from going out and shooting those \"perfect\" images with the camera I already have. reply",

          "text": "I was able to find this blog post of a deep-dive into the ALPSTUGA: https://danieldk.eu/Hardware/Smart-Home/IKEA-ALPSTUGA . The part from the post that answers your question is this: The sensing platform used is a Sensirion SEN63C, which uses a STCC4 for CO₂ measurements. Unfortunately, this is not an NDIR sensor. Instead it uses less accurate thermal conductivity sensing. This allows building smaller/cheaper sensors, but it depends on the input of the temperature/humidity sensor, because e.g. humidity influences measurements. Also, the sensor relies on the air mixture being 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 0.93% Ar, 400 ppm CO₂ and will stop giving accurate readings when this composition changes (modulo CO₂). The operating conditions are also more limited than most other CO₂ sensors (10–40 °C, 20–80% RH). From what I could gather and what is also mentioned in the conclusion is that the sensor is fine to get a general feeling of the CO2 trends, but that you're better off getting a better sensor if you care about exact values. reply",

          "text": "Interesting. What hardware do you use to measure this? I have a Netatmo home device that measures PPM and have been observing the trend lines throughout the day. At some points my flat gets up to about 1400, which the device says is bad, and sometimes it goes down as low as 500. I've noticed a pattern but can't quite connect that pattern to my activity or the surroundings. It starts going up around 4pm, which could be homewards-bound vehicles, but it seems to trend even on weekends when there is lower traffic. Maybe I start breathing differently at these times. I'm quite interested in getting to the bottom of it. Unfortunately I'm west facing so plant use is quite limited. What is the atmospheric ambient CO2 level? Is that variable based on location? I've learnt a few things: - I had my sensor on my work desk which meant the CO2 pooled, and was increased dramatically by my breathing almost directly onto it. Moved the sensor at least 1.5m - I had the sensor quite low down, where CO2 pools (being heavier), so moved the sensor to eye level - CO2 seemed to increase when cooking (same room), so while cooking I open the windows and let the warmth flow out of the building reply",

On round 2 their CTO basically shut me down 2 minutes in saying they're unwilling to do any sort of training and only looking for existing experts in their very specific niche. In round 1 the interviewer told me I seemed like a very good candidate, very positive about my experience. Said they'd been looking for a long while and I was one of the most experienced Go backend developers they'd interviewed. Round 1 was frankly one of the most positive interviews I'd ever had.

The few I bought weren’t certified or anything, but they have lots of very well established sellers. I got a few bronze and silver coins from the Middle East and India. They were in good shape at about $10-20 US (plus international shipping). I also got some nicer Byzantine and Roman coins in the $50 US price range. I tried to group my orders from each seller to save on shipping. So far everything I’ve gotten is exactly as pictured, and the transactions have been very smooth.

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "The only approach I've tried that seems to work reasonably well, and consistently, was the following: Make a commit. Give Claude a task that's not particularly open ended, the closer to pure \"monkey work\" boilerplate nonsense the task is, the better (which is also the sort of code I don't want do deal with myself). Preferably it should be something that only touches a file or two in the codebase unless it is a trivial refactor (like changing the same method call all over the place) Make sure it is set to planning mode and let it come up with a plan. Review the plan. Let it implement the plan. If it works, great, move on to review. I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another. If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue. If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself. Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works. I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder. This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker. I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source. It's pretty good for that. This idea of having an army of agents all working together on the codebase is hilarious to me. Replace \"agents\" with \"juniors I hired on fiverr with anterograde amnesia\" and it's about how well it goes. reply",

          "text": "I used Claude Opus 4.5 inside Cursor to write RISC-V Vector/SIMD code. Specifically Depthwise Convolution and normal Convolution layers for a CNN. I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version. Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files. Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it. It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version. The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well. reply",

For example, investing the time in building a strong test suite and testing strategy ahead of time which both you and the agent can rely on. Being able to manage the agent and getting quality results on a large, complex codebase is a skill in itself, it won’t happen over night. It takes practice and repetition with these tools to level-up, just like any thing else. reply",

          "text": "I have had similar questions, and am still evaluating here. However, I've been increasingly frustrated with the sheer volume of anecdotal evidence from yay and naysayers of LLM-assisted coding. I have personally felt increased productivity at times with it, and frustrations at others. In order to better research, I built (ironically, mostly vibe coded) a tool to run structured \"self-experiments\" on my own usage of AI. The idea is I've init a bunch of hypotheses I have around my own productivity/fulfillment/results with AI-assisted coding. The tool lets me establish those then run \"blocks\" where I test a particular strategy for a time period (default 2 weeks). So for example, I might have a \"no AI\" block followed by a \"some AI\" block followed by a \"full agent all-in AI block\". The tool is there to make doing check-ins easier, basically a tiny CLI wrapper around journaling that stays out of my way. It also does some static analysis on commit frequency, code produced, etc. but I haven't fleshed out that part of it much and have been doing manual analysis at the end of blocks. For me this kind of self-tracking has been more helpful than hearsay, since I can directly point to periods where it was working well and try to figure out why or what I was working on. It's not fool-proof, obviously, but for me the intentionality has helped me get clearer answers. Whether those results translate beyond a single engineer isn't a question I'm interested in answering and feels like a variant of developer metrics-black-hole, but maybe we'll get more rigorous experiments in time.

          "text": "My experience is the same. In short, agents cannot plan ahead, or plan at a high level. This means they have a blindspot for design. Since they cannot design properly, it limits the kind of projects that are viable to smaller scopes (not sure exactly how small but in my experience, extremely small and simple). Anything that exceeds this abstract threshold has a good chance of being a net negative, with most of the code being unmantainable, unextensible, and unreliable. Anyone who claims AI is great is not building a large or complex enough app, and when it works for their small project, they extrapolate to all possibilities. So because their example was generated from a prompt, it's incorrectly assumed that any prompt will also work. That doesn't necessarily follow. The reality is that programming is widely underestimated. The perception is that it's just syntax on a text file, but it's really more like a giant abstract machine with moving parts. If you don't see the giant machine with moving parts, chances are you are not going to build good software. For AI to do this, it would require strong reasoning capabilities, that lets it derive logical structures, along with long term planning and simulation of this abstract machine. I predict that if AI can do this then it will be able to do every single other job, including physical jobs as it would be able to reason within a robotic body in the physical world. To summarize, people are underestimating programming, using their simple projects to incorrectly extrapolate to any possible prompt, and missing the hard part of programming which involves building abstract machines that work on first principles and mathematical logic. reply",

          "text": "Yep, it works. Like anything getting the most out of these tools is its own (human) skill. With that in mind, a couple of comments - think of the coding agents as personalities with blind spots. A code review by all of them and a synthesis step is a good idea. In fact currently popular is the “rule of 5” which suggests you need the LLM to review five times, and to vary the level of review, e.g. bugs, architecture, structure, etc. Anecdotally, I find this is extremely effective. Right now, Claude is in my opinion the best coding agent out there. With Claude code, the best harnesses are starting to automate the review / PR process a bit, but the hand holding around bugs is real. I also really like Yegge’s beads for LLMs keeping state and track of what they’re doing — upshot, I suggest you install beads, load Claude, run ‘!bd prime’ and say “Give me a full, thorough code review for all sorts of bugs, architecture, incorrect tests, specification, usability, code bugs, plus anything else you see, and write out beads based on your findings.” Then you could have Claude (or codex) work through them. But you’ll probably find a fresh eye will save time, e.g. give Claude a try for a day. Your ‘duplicated code’ complaint is likely an artifact of how codex interacts with your codebase - codex in particular likes to load smaller chunks of code in to do work, and sometimes it can get too little context. You can always just cat the relevant files right into the context, which can be helpful. Finally, iOS is a tough target — I’d expect a few more bumps. The vast bulk of iOS apps are not up on GitHub, so there’s less facility in the coding models. And any front end work doesn’t really have good native visual harnesses set up, (although Claude has the Claude chrome extension for web UIs). So there’s going to be more back and forth. Anyway - if you’re a career engineer, I’d tell you - learn this stuff. It’s going to be how you work in very short order. If you’re a hobbyist, have a good time and do whatever you want. reply",

          "text": "Do not blame the tools? Given a clear description (overall design, various methods to add, inputs, outputs), Google Antigravity often writes better zero shot code than an average human engineer - consistent checks for special cases, local optimizations, extensive comments, thorough text coverage. Now in terms of reviews, the real focus is reviewing your own code no matter which tools you used to write it, vi or agentic AI IDE, not someone else reviewing your code. The later is a safety/mentorship tool in the best circumstances and all too often just an excuse for senior architects to assert their dominance and justify their own existence at the expense of causing unnecessary stress and delaying getting things shipped. Now in terms of using AI, the key is to view yourself as a technical lead, not a people manager. You don't stop coding completely or treat underlying frameworks as a black box, you just do less of it. But at some point fixing a bug yourself is faster than writing a page of text explaining exactly how you want it fixed. Although when you don't know the programming language, giving pseudocode or sample code in another language can be super handy. reply",

The bottom line is this: * The developer stop been a developer, and becomes a product designer with high technical skills. * This is a different set of skills than than a developer or a product owner currently have. It is a mix of both, and the expectations of how agentic development works need to be adjusted. * Agents will behave like junior developers, they can type very fast, and produce something that has a high probability to work. They priority will be to make it work, not maintainability, scalability, etc. Agents can achieve that if you detail how to produce it. * The working with an agent feels more like mentoring the AI than ask and receive. * When I start to work on a product that will be vibe coded, I need to have clear in my head all the user stories, code architecture, the whole system, then I can start to tell the agent what to build, and correct and annotate in the md files the code quality decisions so it remembers them. * Use TDD, ask the agent to create the tests, and then code to the test. Don't correct the bugs, make the agent correct them and explain why that is a bug, specially with code design decisions. Store those in AGENTS.md file at the root of the project. There are more things that can be done to guide the agent, but I need to have clear in an articulable way the direction of the coding. On the other side, I don't worry about implementation details like how to use libraries and APIs that I am not familiar with, the agent just writes and I test. Currently I am working on a product and I can tell you, working no more than 10 hours a week (2 hours here, 3 there, leave the agent working while I am having dinner with family) I am progressing at I would say 5 to 10 times faster than without it. So, yeah it works, but I had to adjust how I do my job. reply",

I gave it the old code, told it to translate to Go.   I pre-installed a compiled C binary and told it to validate its work using interop tests. It took about four hours of what the vibecoding lovers call \"prompt engineering\" but at the end I have to admit it did give me a pretty decent \"translation\". However for everything else I have tried (and yes, vibecoders, \"tried\" means very tightly defined tasks) all I have ever got is over-engineered vibecoding slop. The worst part of of it is that because the typical cut-off window is anywhere between 6–18 months prior, you get slop that is full of deprecated code because there is almost always a newer/more efficient way to do things.  Even in languages like Go.  The difference between an AI-slop answer for Go 1.20 and a human coded Go 1.24/1.25 one can be substantial. reply",

It is more likely to undertake refactors that break the code and then iterates on those errors in a sort of spiral. A request that would normally take 3-4 minutes will turn into a 10 minute adventure before I revert the changes, call out the mistake, and try again. It will happily admit the mistake, but the pattern seems to be consistent.<p>I haven't performed a like for like test and that would be interesting, but has anyone else noticed the same?</p></p></div>",

My working theory is that under higher load, the model is more likely to:\n- take broader interpretive leaps\n- attempt larger refactors instead of minimal diffs\n- “explain its way forward” after a wrong turn rather than reset cleanly That shows up as rabbit holes and self-reinforcing iterations, especially on\ncodebases where local consistency matters more than global cleverness. What’s helped a bit for me:\n- explicitly asking for minimal, localized changes\n- telling it not to refactor unless necessary\n- breaking requests into smaller steps and locking earlier decisions It could also be variance from routing, context window pressure, or subtle\nprompt drift rather than a predictable nightly degradation, but the pattern\nof “overconfident refactor spirals” feels real. A like-for-like experiment with the same prompt and context at different times\nwould be interesting, though hard to fully control. reply",

The most reliable time to see it fall apart is when Google makes a public announcement that is likely to cause a sudden influx of people using it. And there are multiple levels of failure, first you start seeing iffy responses of obvious lesser quality than usual and then if things get really bad you start seeing just random errors where Gemini will suddenly lose all of its context (even on a new chat) or just start failing at the UI level by not bothering to finish answers, etc. The sort of obvious likely reason for this is when the models are under high load they probably engage in a type of dynamic load balancing where they fall back to lighter models or limit the amount of time/resources allowed for any particular prompt. reply",

An individual /32 has a specific datacenter (so basically unicast). In a hypothetical world where BGP could route /32s it wouldn’t be anycast. I wasn’t precise, but what I meant was more akin to a single IP shared by multiple datacenters in different regions (from a BGP perspective), which I don’t think Cloudflare has. This is general parallel of ingress unicast as well, a single IP that can be routed to multiple destinations (even if on the BGP level, the entire aggregate is anycast). It would also not explain the OP, because they are seeing the same source IP, but from many (presumably) different source locations whereas with the Cloudflare scheme each location would have a different source IP. reply",

It's just that which one will depend on server location and network configuration (and could change at any time).

The reverse DNS on that page though suggests that the range is mainly full of name-servers, which would be strange to get requests from but I have no idea what cloudflare does on its network. As for the multiple datacentre thing - one IP address can be Anycast-ed to multiple actual hosts in different physical locations. For example, if I ping 173.245.58.0, I get a response in 11ms from my location here in Helsinki. At the speed of light this means travelling 3,300KM (0.011s * 3x10^8m/s) which doesn't get me anywhere near the States. So again, nothing exciting about 1 IP address coming from different locations.

Site operators arbitrarily blocking entire countries due to a few botters (albeit with a lot of bots) causing issues aren't without responsibility in the loss of an open web.

I'd say what OP is referencing is that LLM's are increasingly adept at writing software that fulfills a set of requirements, with the prompter acting as a product manager. This devalues software engineers in that many somewhat difficult technical tasks, once the sole domain of SWEs is not commodified via agentic coding tools. reply",

I have personally given the thumbs down to two developers who came from a FAANG when it was clear that they were just code monkeys who had to have everything handed to them.

          "text": "(Yes I know the trend I’m about to talk about was different in BigTech and adjacent. I did an almost 4 year stint at a FAANG 2 years ago and have no need or desire to go back at 51.  That’s not where most developers work) Back around 2013-2014 well before AI, I saw the trend that it wasn’t going to take much to be a “good enough” enterprise “full stack” developer meaning the market was going to be commoditized and if i  was  just a “I codez good and pull tickets off the board” developer, it was going to be hard to stand out from the crowd. I was prescient, when companies reach out to me now for standard enterprise dev jobs in Atlanta (no longer live there but a large part of my network is still there) I see the same salaries I saw in 2016. I worked over the next six years to move “up the stack”.  I learned soft skills, learned AWS and how to treat it more than just a glorified Colo, learned how to lead projects, talk to the “business”, focused on business value, started getting closer to sales and how they operate etc. Out of everything I said, the take away should not be to “learn cloud”.  Everyone and their dog knows AWS (except for one niche that has opened a few doors to me). The take away is to incease the “scope and impact” of your work beyond just being a code monkey.  Also learn how to work at an increased level of ambiguity. https://www.levels.fyi/blog/swe-level-framework.html AI is just another part of the commoditization and devaluation of the generic developer.  There is no “moat” around being a generic full stack/mobile/web developer. As of 2020, I work in cloud consulting specializing in app dev.  I have been working full time for consulting departments (the internal one at AWS) and after being Amazoned in late 2023, it took me all of three weeks to have three offers.  After I made a bad choice between the three in 2023, it again took me two weeks to have an offer. I haven’t had to do a coding interview in over a decade because I know how to communicate my value and experience and I don’t try to compete on “I codez real gud”. I’m not a super special snowflake reply",

Curious what others do and in what context. It makes tons of sense for a dedicated device in a work context. At home do you have a different account for say your kid?

The idea is that my main personal and work accounts use exclusively open source apps, and any context which demands proprietary apps gets siloed off somewhere. Two of the user accounts have google services framework installed, but neither is logged in to the play store. The reason that the phone is more complex is that I am essentially never forced to use proprietary apps on my desktops, there has always been a way to work around it. But not so on the phone. reply",

          "text": "I am very passionate about this question - so much so that I happened make a blog post about it yesterday! I recommend giving LLMs credentials that are extremely fine-grained, where the credentials can only permit the actions you want to allow and not permit the actions you don't want to allow. Often, it may be hard or impossible to do this with your database settings alone - in that case, you can use proxies to separate the credentials the LLM/agent has from the credentials that are actually made to the DB. The proxy can then enforce what you want to allow or block. SSH is trickier because commands are mixed in with all the other data going on in the bytestream during your session. I previously wrote another blog post about just how tricky enforcing command allowlists can be as well: https://www.joinformal.com/blog/allowlisting-some-bash-comma... . A lot of developer CLI tools were not designed to be run by potentially malicious users who can add arbitrary flags! I also have really appreciated simonw's writing on the topic. Disclaimer: I work at Formal, a company that helps organizations use proxies for least privilege. reply",

You can also use something like ForceCommand in SSHD config (or command= in your authorized_keys file) to only grant access to a single command (which could be a wrapper around the commands you want it to be able to access). This does somewhat limit the flexibility of what the AI can deal with. My actual suggestion is to change the model you are using to control your servers. Ideally, you shouldn't be SSHing to servers to do things; you should be controlling your servers via some automation system, and you can just have your AI modify the automation system. You can then verify the changes it is making before committing the changes to your control system.

Still not bulletproof, but removes the \"approve every ls command\" friction while keeping the obvious footguns out of reach. The mental model shift that helped: treat it less like \"allow/deny lists\" and more like designing a sandbox where the worst outcome is acceptable.

For prod DB read-only I just add tables/columns as they become relevant (so it's allowlist). Claude usually sequences table schema and stuff from staging DB / local migrations and then reads prod DB. When it fails access to something I decide if I want to give it or not. It eventually reaches a stage where I'm comfortable with always starting my day with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue`. The prod DB read/write creds are in company 1password which I don't have app installed (I rarely need company creds). LLM maybe could figure out some way to get into my Bitwarden which I do routinely use but short of creating and running keylogger I think it's fine. It's mildly annoying you have to periodically `GRANT SELECT` but now I'm much more careful organizing the schema in an LLM-friendly way. Postgresql can do column-security and I'm forced to use that sometimes but I refactored design to just be table-level. reply",

So if we pretend that you would like to grant a user access to your database then a reasonable approach would be to write a parser (parsing > validating) to parse the sql commands. You should define the parser such that it only uses a subset of sql which you consider to be safe. Now if your parser is able to parse the command of the llm (and therefore the command is part of the subset of sql which you consider to be safe) then you execute the command. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">To make a preface first: I am currently located in Belgrade, Serbia and I am trying to see where I could find potential investor for the project I am working on.<p>I know the places such as OpenVC https://www.openvc.app/, but I do not know anyone that had any experience with it. I am really not sure if anyone has invested in projects from Serbia outside ElevenFund, SouthCentral Ventures and few more.<p>For someone wondering why not to look for local investments: Aside from the current political turmoil, the investment here is not that encouraging - you give away a large percent of equity for the investment that is not enough to cover yearly costs in some cases.<p>About the project: I come from the HR field, and in current climate finding job is really hard. A lot of candidates apply, and at the same time a lot of positions are saturated with applications, that most of the time are not even viewed. This in turn makes finding job even harder.<p>The traditional ATS model feels like black hole where you just throw your resume and hope for the best. With the addition of AI to analyze and pick resumes it gets even worse. Additionally, a lot of them are saturated with features which most people either don't use or know how to use at all.<p>Getting rejected from one company shouldn't be the end of the road when searching for job, it should be just the start until it is finished and concludes with hiring somewhere.<p>The idea itself is to connect applicants (with their consent) that have been rejected, with other companies that are looking for same profiles. This cuts Time To Hire saving the costs for company on the one side, and at the same time it cuts the time for people to find a job, since the system matches them with potential companies in a similar way like dating apps. It can also reduce reliance on hiring agencies as time goes by.<p>As more people use the ATS the database will get bigger, thus the quality of the matches will get better. The AI here can be used for better matchmaking and building better recommendation system, while making sure that there is human behind the feels to check every match, resume and so on.<p>I have already built an MVP that shows how it would function, and am currently in the process of working out with friend in making it to be in usable state for others. I've researched PMF (Product Market Fit) and how it fits in current market. As for the monetization I have additional ideas aside for the typical subscription payed per seat/package.<p>The product itself is B2B oriented with both the individuals and companies being the beneficiaries of it.<p>I am open to hearing more on how should I proceed in this regards and where to go next really because finding investment from Serbia seems like looking to find a needle in a haystack.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Truth be told, the Sales or Business Development in this case is something that is key in order to break the ice in terms of B2B so that it would get others potentially interested in trying it out and using it.

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

There are paid (micro) influencer campaigns going on and what not. Also bear in mind that a lot of folks want to be seen as being on the bleeding edge, including famous people. They get money from people booking them for courses and consulting, buying their books, products and stuff. A \"personal brand\" can have a lot of value. They can't be seen as obsolete. They're likely to talk about what could or will be, more than about what currently is. Money isn't always the motive for sure, people also want to be considered useful, they want to genuinely play around and try and see where things are going. All that said, I think your approach is fine. If you don't inspect what the agent is doing, you're down to faith. Is it the fastest way to get _something_ working? Probably not. Is it the best way to build an understanding of the capabilities and pit falls? I'd say so. This stuff is relatively new, I don't think anyone has truly figured out how to best approach LLM assisted development yet. A lot of folks are on it, usually not exactly following the scientific method. We'll get evidence eventually. reply",

The expression of the idea, while not even close to value I assign to fixing the thing, still has meaning. e.g. I would happily share code my friend wrote that fixed something.

Like a lot of people I speak to privately, I'm making a lot of money directly from software largely written by LLMs (roadmaps compressed from 1-2 years to months since Claude Code was released), but the company has never mentioned LLMs or AI in any marketing, client communications, or public releases.

Here are a sample of (IMO) extremely talented and well known developers who have expressed that agentic coding helps them: Antirez (creator of Reddit), DHH (creator of RoR), Linus (Creator of Linux), Steve Yegge, Simon Wilison. This is just randomly off the top of my head, you can find many more. None of them claim that agentic coding does a years' worth of work for them in an hour, of course. In addition, pretty much every developer I know has used some form of GenAI or agentic coding over the last year, and they all say it gives them some form of speed up, most of them significant. The \"AI doesn't help me\" crowd is, as far as I can tell, an online-only phenomenon. In real life, everyone has used it to at least some degree and finds it very valuable. reply",

You'd ensure that half the developers did LLM first, and the others traditional first. You'd only be able to detect large statistical effects, but that would be a good start.

Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We're nowhere near full agentic coding. However, by reinvesting the speed gains from not writing boilerplate into devex and tests/security, I bring to life much better quality software, maintainable and a boy to work with. I suddenly have the homelab of my dreams, all the ideas previously in the \"too long to execute\" category now get vibe coded while watching TV or doing other stuff. As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want. Most importantly though, and I've heard this from a few other seniors: I've found joy in making cool fun things with tech again.

Trying to let the LLM do the whole task most often fail, or produce low quality code (even with top models like Opus 4.5). What works well though is \"assisted\" coding. I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks.

If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it).

Particularly interesting because I didn't expect this to work, let along not to write any code. Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (\"Heart Rate 76bpm\"), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use. Every file is claude generated. AMA. edit: this was particularly interesting as it had to test against the HRM sensor I was wearing during development, and to cope with bluetooth devices appearing and disappearing all the time. It took about a day for the whole thing and cost around $25. further edit: I am by no means an expert with Claude (haven't even got to making a claude.md file); the one real objective here was to get a working example of using dBus to talk to blueZ in C, something I've failed at (more than once) before. reply",

That's why I felt like reviewing the code in the first place, and why I gave the feedback. I understand now that maybe it felt like my impromptu code review came out of nowhere, but I thought you were actually trying to give OP a accurate sample, so sorry if it felt like it came out of nowhere :) reply",

No, that's been established since Karpathy coined the term; you don't review the code, only use the agent and don't care about how it was done, just about the results. The actual interesting stuff is how to use LLMs together with a human, to build high quality code. More \"augmenting the human intellect\" rather than \"autonomous robots building for you\". Overall I'd say if someone handed you a specification that named SSE specifically, you created files with SSE in the name, and the implementation talks about doing SSE, yet it doesn't actually do SSE in the end, it's pretty much on par with code in commercial settings, yeah :) But maybe our bar should be slightly above the ground at least? :) reply",

Bear in mind this was a purely personal project, never intended to see the light of day and initially just done to create a small but operable chunk of dbus/blueZ glue code for another project. I have no doubt that a C developer with sufficient knowledge of dBus, bluetooth, the HRM profile and linux could have written the C code in a day. Adding the HTTP server again would be easy if the developer also had experience of that (n.b. there was a minor compiler error when I tried it on another system due to a slightly different version of libmicrohttpd). Adding the API would be straighforward (but tedious) and similiarly the web page (the web page was an one-shot after Claude wrote the API, vis. \"Create a web page to display a real time plot with history using the API\"). So overall I'd answer that that human developers would could have pulled that off in a day are few and far between (and likely to cost a lot more than $25 plus a day of my time). And do I think the code is good enough? Yes, more than good enough. I could take it and run with it, against that because it ended up 100% AI-generated I feel a bit like leaving it as a monument to \"pure AI\".

          "text": "I use Augment with Claud Opus 4.5 every day at my job. I barely ever write code by hand anymore. I don't blindly accept the code that it writes, I iterate with it. We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools. I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools. A few very concrete advantages I've found: * I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away. * It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not. Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well: 1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you. 2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea. 3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step. 4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...). 5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.) This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial. reply",

Back then, it was lively and active and loads of fun. Over time it's developed close to 5,000 members (it actually had over 5,000 members at one point) and currently has 501 members online as I type this. It's more likely there's about 10-15 that are paying attention to anything happening.<p>It's a Discord that originally focused on DevOps. It complemented my YouTube channel on the same topic, but since then, as it's slowly died out, and my channel's focus as shifted and changed, it's become a bit of a waste land.<p>It's a shame really, because a really fun Discord server can be a great place to be, but I'm not sure where to take it now.<p>How would you handle this situation? What would be your approach to reviving the Discord and perhaps trying to get a community of like minded hackers going again in 2026?<p>I won't link the Discord here as I'm not trying to beg for users or spam. I just genuinely want to work on a solution to improve the life of the server. I will put it in my HN profile, though, so if you do want to check it out that extra step is required.<p>Are people even interested in Discord servers any more? I don't know.<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Are you posting your videos to them? Do people have things to say about the new focus?) Most of what keeps a Discord active or not is content and having things to chat about.

In a lot of ways, this is a major regression as far as security and redundancy is concerned. There's also the good old saying: Don't build your castle in somebody else's Kingdom. Bot developers definitely learned that recently.

          "text": "Maybe I should have made it more clear, but it's pretty good if you know how to work with it. The issue is that it's usually faster to just read the documentation and write the code yourself. Depending on what you're working on of course. Like with the yaml, a LLM can write you an ingress config in a second or two from a very short prompt. It can do similar things with Python if you specify exactly how you want something and what dependencies you want. That's being bad at programming in my opinion. You can mitigate it a lot with how you config you agents. Mine loads our tech stack. The best practices we've decided to use. The fact that I value safety first but am otherwise a fan of the YAGNI philosophy and so on. I spent a little time and build these things into my personal agent on our enterprise AI plan, and I use it a lot. I still have to watch it like a hawk, but I do think it's a great tool. I guess you could say that your standard LLM will write better Python than I did 10 years ago, but that's not really good enough when you work on systems which can't fail. It's fine on 90% (I made this number up) of software though. reply",

So far Opus 4.5 has been the one LLM that keeps mostly coding in a, how to say, predictable way even with a existing code base. It requires scaffolding and being very clear with your coding requests. But not like the older models where they go off script way too much or rewrite code in their own style. For me Opus 4.5 has reached that sweet spot of productivity and not just playing around with LLMs and undoing mistakes. The problem with LLMs is a lot of times a mix of LLM issues, people giving different requests, context overload, different models doing better with different languages, the amount of data it needs to alter etc... This makes the results very mixed from one person to another, and harder to quantify. Even the different in a task makes the difference between a person one day glorifying a LLM and a few weeks later complaining it was nerfed, when it was not.

I start every new feature w/Claude Code in plan mode. I give it the first step, point it to relevant source files, and tell it to generate a plan.  I go catch up on my Slack messages. I check back in and iterate on the plan until I’m happy, then tell it to implement. I go to a team meeting. I come back and review all the code. Anything I don’t 100% understand I ask Gemini to explain. I cross-check with primary sources if it’s important. I tweak the generated code by hand (faster than talking with the agent), then switch back to plan mode and ask for specific tests. I almost always need to clean up the tests for doing way too much manual setup, despite a lot of Claude.md instructions to the contrary. In the end, I probably get the work done in 30% less wall-clock time of Claude implementing (counting plan time), but I’m also doing other things while the agent crunches. Maybe 50% speed boost in total productivity? I also learn something new on about a third of features, which is way more than I did before. reply",

          "text": "I’m being pushed to use it more and more at work and it’s just not that great. I have paid access to Copilot with ChatGPT and Claude for context. The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform. Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies. So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops! I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole. reply",

Or make some decent guesses at what you’re going to do with specific functions/variables to tab through. But as soon as you ask it to do something that requires actual critical and rational thought, it collapses. Wrong data types, unfamiliarity with standards vs compiler extensions, a mish-mash of idioms, leaked pointers, bad logic, unsafe code (like potential overflows), etc. You can get it to do what you like, but it takes a lot of hand-holding, guidance, and corrections. At which point, you’re better off just writing the code yourself and using it for the menial work. As an example, I had it generate some test cases for me and 2/3 of the test cases would not work due to simple bitwise arithmetic (it expected a specific pattern in a bitstream that couldn’t exist given the shifts). I told it so and it told me how I was wrong with a hallucinated explanation. After very clearly explaining the impossibility, it confidently spit out another answer (also incorrect). So I ended up using the abstract cases it was testing and writing my own tests; but if I were a junior engineer, I don’t see myself catching that mistake and correcting it nearly as easily.

          "text": "It occurs to me that \"write a C program that [problem description]\" is an extremely under-constrained task. People are highly aware that C++ programmers are always using some particular subset of C++; but it's not as obvious that any actual C programmer is actually going to use a particular dialect on top of C. Since the C standard library is so anemic for algorithms and data structures, any given \"C programmer\" is going to have a hash map of choice, a b-tree of choice, a streams abstraction of choice, an async abstraction of choice, etc. And, in any project they create, they're going to depend on (or vendor in) those low-level libraries. Meanwhile, any big framework-ish library (GTK, OpenMP, OpenSSL) is also going to have its own set of built-in data structures that you have to use to interact with it (because it needs to take and return such data-structures in its API, and it has to define them in order to do that.) Which often makes it feel more correct, in such C projects, to use that framework's abstractions throughout your own code, rather than also bringing your own favorite ones and constantly hitting the impedance wall of FFI-ing between them. It's actually shocking that, in both FOSS and hiring, we expect \"experienced C programmers\" who've worked for 99% of their careers with a dialect of C consisting of abstractions from libraries E+F+G, to also be able to jump onto C codebases that instead use abstractions from libraries W+X+Y+Z (that may depend on entirely different usage patterns for their safety guarantees!), look around a bit, and immediately be productively contributing. It's no wonder an AI can't do that. Humans can barely do it! My guess is that the performance of an AI coding agent on a greenfield C project would massively improve if you initially prompt it (or instruct it in an AGENTS.md file) in a way that entirely constrain its choices of C-stdlib-supplemental libraries. Either by explicitly listing them; or by just saying e.g. \"Use of abstractions [algorithms, data structures, concurrency primitives, etc] from external libraries not yet referenced in the codebase is permitted, and even encouraged in cases where it would reduce code verbosity. Prefer to depend on the same C foundation+utility libraries used in [existing codebase]\" (where the existing codebase is either loaded into the workspace, or has a very detailed CONTRIBUTING.md you can point the agent at.) reply",

          "text": "First of all, that conference is right down the road from me, and I never knew about it. So, thanks for sharing! My first job was working at a credit union software company. I designed and built the front-end (windows applications, a telephone banking system, and a home-banking web thing) and middle-tier systems (VB.NET-based services). The real back-end, though, was  an old COBOL system. I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language. I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong). reply",

It's wild: in the video you linked it's explained COBOL was meant for machines that don't exist anymore so COBOL is running inside emulators. So you have Java code, generating COBOL code, that's then run on an emulator emulating an old IBM system that was meant to run COBOL. It's just wild . Some of the tools are even front-facing users (bank employees): at times you can still see at some banks an employee running an app in a monochrome green-on-black text terminal emulator that is basically COBOL. It's weird, just weird. But legacy code is legacy code. And if you think COBOL's legacy is bad, Java is going to dwarf COBOL's legacy big times (for Java is typically used at the kind of places that still use COBOL and it's used way more than COBOL). So in the future, heck, we may have a new language, generating, inside an emulator emulating current machines/OSes, Java code that is going to be code generating COBOL code (!), that's then going to be run in an emulator. reply",

And every problem, ever, with that housing now has some of ClickCo's name and reputation glued to it. Barrier 2:  That I'm familiar with, tax codes are not friendly to employer-provided housing.  ClickCo paying >$X/month to housing Wanda Worker-Bee, when $X/month more pay would let her pick her own as-good housing, is a losing move. Barrier 3:  If you're thinking of ClickCo building housing - talk to an MBA.  At scale, housing developments are mammoth capital investments, for something  unrelated to ClickCo's business, with (at best) multi-year lead times and very long asset life expectancies. Barrier 4:  If ClickCo wants to scale up, or down, or shift parts of its workforce to or from a location - any housing it has built is immovable, and very slow and difficult to scale. (In general, \"migrant labor housing\" implies that the workers are paid very poorly.  And willing to live in something more like a refugee camp.) reply",

Cool, but that’s not what’s wearing me down. What actually hurts is the constant context switching while trying to understand how a system fits together, what depends on what, and what changed recently.<p>As systems grow, this feels like it gets exponentially harder. Add logs and now you’ve created a million new events to reason about. Add another database and suddenly you’re dealing with subnet constraints or a DB choice that’s expensive as hell, and no one noticed until later. Everyone knows their slice, but the full picture lives nowhere, so bit rot just keeps creeping in.<p>This feels even worse now that AI agents are pushing large amounts of code and config changes quickly. Things move faster, but shared understanding falls behind even faster.<p>I’m honestly stuck on how people handle this well in practice. For folks dealing with real production systems, what’s actually helped? Diagrams, docs, tribal knowledge, tooling, something else? Where does it break down?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Good hierarchical documentation A laptop computer is extremely complex, but is actively developed and maintained by a small number of people, built on parts themselves developed by a small number of people, many of which are themselves built on parts themselves developed by a small number of people, and so on and so forth. This works well in electronics design, because everything is documented and tested to comply with the documentation.  You'd think this would slow things down, but developing a new generation of a laptop takes fewer man hours and less calendar time than developing a new generation of any software of a similar complexity running on it, despite the laptop skirting with the limitations of physics.  Technical debt adds up really fast. The top-level designers only have access to what the component manufacturers have published, and not to their internal designs, but that doesn't matter because the publications include correct and relevant data.  When the component manufacturer comes out with something new, they use documentation from their supplier, to design the new product. As long as each components of documentation is complete and accurate, it will meet all of the needs of anyone using that component.  Diving deeper would only be necessary if something is incomplete or inaccurate. reply",

      "title": "Ask HN: How to introduce Claude Code to a team?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am responsible for a small team of software engineers, including an industry veteran of 30 years, a junior developer on their first job, plus a view mid-level to senior folks. We have been using AI tools like IDE-integrated Copilot suggestions or ChatGPT, and are working with the OpenAI API in our product for assistant experiences, but did not (as a team) use coding agents yet.<p>I recently got introduced to Claude Code by a friend who quit their job to build a new product entirely on their own, by leveraging Claude to maximum effect. So that was kind of an awakening moment for me: The possible gains of productivity when putting it to good use are pretty incredible. I had been following the space closely, but after my experiments with early Cursor half a year ago, I didn't consider really working with coding agents. The last weeks, I did make massive progress on an OSS pet project of mine that has been stalling for years. So at this point, I realised I'll have to onboard my team at work to Claude Code, and finally improve on development velocity—the one, recurring complaint from the rest of the company.<p>However, I am wondering how to do this properly: I don't want to loose buy-in from a team with very diverse needs, and risk leaving either seniors frustrated with their job changing completely nor juniors playing with a blackbox they have no chance of understanding, or working with effectively.\nThe more time I spend thinking about it, the more I realise how fundamental development processes change now: From setting up Claude to pre-screen GitHub issues and make a plan before we even start, to addressing all those long-standing but tedious tasks that have been laying around forever, rules for what we can do and how we work have changed entirely.<p>Now I think I am not the only one who experienced some variation of this story, and I want to know how you introduced your engineers to coding agents? Do you have reading recommendations or tips to get people started? I'm grateful for any advice here.</p></p></p></div>",

Which I understand on one side, but then: immoscout24 is basicly the biggest player and this is not about consumer goods but one essential good: flats, space to live. So I think it should be mandatory to offer data to everyone who wants to research house & flat pricing/demand data. 2. A generic API for governmental financial transaction data! This would make research so much easiere. There are couple of open data platforms, but look at how scrambled the data is. What is a \"financial transaction\"? It's basically nothing else then \"from, to, amount, reason, category\" - I know there's more, but you can break it down, if you want. So, right now every city, district and government is maintaining their own \"database\". I once tried to analyse EFRE data. Turns out, while this data is basically open and free, every party offers their own weird format, XLSX, CSV and you name it. I don't see why no one ever tooks the effort to \"normalize\" such a simple thing - again: I know there's more. But the big picture should simply allow you to create a generic protocol/stream for that kind of data. reply",

Simplistically, its all about incentives, “you've got to dance while the music is playing.” If a professional money manager doesnt follow the mania theyre going to significantly underperform their competitors/benchmarks. If they underperform for multiple quarters theyre going to lose allocation, customers, and their jobs. See also the “perma bears” who have predicted “15 of the last 3 recessions.” As an individual you can change your risk profile by rebalancing or profit taking during the mania. trying to find quality places to put your gains to reduce the downside risk. That said, in even a moderate correction youre going to underperform the index due to the silly magnitude of those mania gains over time. Eg an additional 2 years of +30% and then a 25% correction is going to outperform your “safe” 7% returns. reply",

          "text": "You sent me down a rabbit hole, but apparently discussions of previous bubbles were quite large: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=tech+bubble%2C... and https://trends.google.com/explore?q=tech%2520bubble%2Creal%2... Discussions of a bubble are always common in retrospect, so they peak after the bubble bursts.  The Google Books data includes magazines and newspapers, but ends in 2022.  The Google Search data is newer and closer tracks the interests of individuals than reporters and commentators, but has much lower precision. The dot-com bubble burst in early 2000, but the term didn't exist at the time.  It was called a \"tech bubble\" or \"internet bubble\", with usage of the two tracking similarly and \"tech bubble\" being far more dominant.  The terms' usages peaked in 2007, but had already gained some prominence at the time of the bubble burst. The real-estate bubble (really a real-estate lending bubble) burst in 2008 with the already strong usage of the term \"real estate bubble\" really accelerating at the start of 2005, and peaking in 2012. Interestingly, usage of the term \"tech bubble\" started falling right when the real-estate peaked, perhaps with its prominence relegating the dot-com bubble to history. Despite AI being an on-and-off overhyped buzzword since the 70's \"AI buble\", doesn't really show up in Google Books before the 2022 cutoff, which is also the year of the public release of ChatGPT, when LLMs quickly became a hot topic, but before there was enough hype for a bubble.  Searches for \"AI bubble\" overtook \"bitcoin bubble\" at the start of 2023. The growth in searches for \"AI bubble\" started accelerating last April, and report as peaking last November, although with the noisier data from Google Search, it may be a false peak.  The AI bubble is itself a tech bubble, but with AI being the buzzword this time around, instead of the internet domains that ruled the last tech bubble.  Searches for \"tech bubble\" are much lower than \"AI bubble\" but follow the same trend, with both showing a small peak in July, a dip in August, and a strong peak in November. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have had a blast getting Claude Code to manage my home infrastructure. I have been against the cloud forever, so I have had to build a home setup that does a lot of cloud stuff. Like, I run Resillio Sync for all my family iOS photo backups, and a local NAS to host my legally downloaded and owned movies and tv shows, I also use a bunch of raspberry pis, doing things like running local Home Assistant z-wave and zigbee sensors. The router, switches, and APs are all UniFI, same with all the cameras, door bells, and VoIP. Again, all local first (except Talk, obvs).<p>As you can imagine, maintaining entropy for all these disparate systems takes time, of which I have less now that I have young kids. So when Claude Code was released, I took to it like a fish to water. We mapped my entire network, I created accounts on all the devices so it can SSH into everything and configure everything (including the Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro!). I have been blow away at how well it troubleshoots and fixes everything.<p>I have a DGX Spark AI workstation (128gb of memory), and I really want to now hand off the work to a local model, either using Opencode or Claude Code harnesses and simply pointing at a vLLM instantiated model accessable by API (just point Opencode or Claude Code at the local IP and API endpoint).<p>It works, except I tried Qwen3-coder just now and it's refusing to help due to security concerns. Ugh. I then tried GLM-4.7-Flash, but vLLM doesn't support yet and so before I rebuild (ask Claude Code to rebuild and deploy) to try GLM.4-7-Flash with some other inference provider, does anyone have a model they use for infrastructure maintenance that isn't a little bitch? I will probably eventually go to an abliterated model if none of the open source ones will help.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "What had Qwen3-coder rejected? Right now that seems like the strongest recommendation. GLM-4.7-Flash seems very promising but is so new. Gemma3 is also very good. Nanbeige-4 is supposedly incredibly capable. Both are very small. https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it https://huggingface.co/Nanbeige/Nanbeige4-3B-Thinking-2511 Ideally IMO, you should probably build little tools or a multi-tool for doing the work you want done. Rather than having LLMs having to figure out what needs to be done, doing a more code mode style of development and giving the LLM's the ability to call your tool will be far faster and far more consistent with far lower resources. Tiny models like FunctionGemma will be able to take simple commands and get the work done, very fast, with very little resources. Anthropic wrote this up, citing also CloudFlare calling it Code Mode . https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-... https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mc... (Note that while Anthropic is suggesting MCP for their \"code mode\" direction, and while writing MCP's is super easy: writing a cli tool can have just as good as a results! And is often easier for humans to work with!) reply",

I think a good PM is someone that works with us, advocates for our opinions, assuming they are good, and so on. Really good / quality communication between a PM and their eng's will go a long way. Being flexible and available will go a long way. I think you'll pick up on this pretty quick. I think you should go beyond the basics of jira and probably learn other tools too at some point and aim to be a master of those. If for no other reason that you can be there as a resource if eng's need questions answered about it. It feels like every year I have to learn a new tool or get confused after some update depending on what we're using. This advice may be foo bar. Someone else may mention this but in short, being somewhat technically knowledgeable will help a lot with understanding terms, conversely having to explain them, etc. Not all eng's are great at explaining to non-technical folks things they really need to understand sometimes. I think a PM can step in, in those instances, if done correctly. Best of luck. Are you sending apps in currently? reply",

On the project I've been working on, it feels like I've gotten multiple months worth of work done in a week. Most of that time would have been spent researching some statistical methods for doing things, and it's much quicker to verify a method as being accurate, than it is to find one that works and learn how to create an implementation.<p>However, this has still had me running code in my computer that is, to say the least, dubious. I'm using Google Gemini Pro, and while I keep asking the LLM to only give me chunks of code that it's changing, it keeps asking me to just replace, say, the main.py file completely. This has me genuinely concern about running arbitrary code on my machine, intentionally or just due to laziness.<p>My question here is (1) how much of a risk am I taking on running this kind of code when it's not at all related to my internal filesystem, (2) what are mitigation strategies I can take to protect myself beyond regular backups short of just doing everything in, say multipass or UTM, and (3) if I need to run a virtual machine for everything, which is the easiest to run for moving back and forth between normal use on a mac?<p>Really appreciate any advice here. I'm mostly a hobbyist programmer, even if I've been developing stuff in Python for a decade and a half a this point.</p></p></p></div>",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

There are paid (micro) influencer campaigns going on and what not. Also bear in mind that a lot of folks want to be seen as being on the bleeding edge, including famous people. They get money from people booking them for courses and consulting, buying their books, products and stuff. A \"personal brand\" can have a lot of value. They can't be seen as obsolete. They're likely to talk about what could or will be, more than about what currently is. Money isn't always the motive for sure, people also want to be considered useful, they want to genuinely play around and try and see where things are going. All that said, I think your approach is fine. If you don't inspect what the agent is doing, you're down to faith. Is it the fastest way to get _something_ working? Probably not. Is it the best way to build an understanding of the capabilities and pit falls? I'd say so. This stuff is relatively new, I don't think anyone has truly figured out how to best approach LLM assisted development yet. A lot of folks are on it, usually not exactly following the scientific method. We'll get evidence eventually. reply",

While I agree with the latter, I actually think on former point - that hype is making sober discussion impossible - is actually directionally incorrect. Like a lot of people I speak to privately, I'm making a lot of money directly from software largely written by LLMs (roadmaps compressed from 1-2 years to months since Claude Code was released), but the company has never mentioned LLMs or AI in any marketing, client communications, or public releases.

Outside of tech companies, I think this is extremely common. > It can be a joy to work with LLMs if you have to write the umpteenth javascript CRUD boilerplate.

It's a real problem, people literally do not understand that a question is not an opportunity to show off or to dominate, but is a request for an exchange of information. And that problem is not just between people, this lack of communication skill continues with people's internal self conversations. Many a bully personality is that way because they bully themselves and terrorize themselves. It's no wonder that people can use AI at all, with how poorly people communicate. So the cluster of nonsense that is all the shallow thinkers directing people down incorrect paths is completely understandable. They are learning by doing, which with any other technology would be fine, but with AI to learn how to use it by using it can serious damage one's cognitive ability, as well as leave a junkyard of failed projects behind. reply",

Point is, I don't believe anyone is at the local maximum yet, models changed too much the last years to really get to something stable. And I'm also willing to leave some doubt that my impression/feeling might be off. Measuring short term productivity is one thing. Measuring long term effects on systems is much harder. We had a few software crises in the past. That's not because people back then were idiots, they just followed what seemed to work. Just like we do today. The feedback loop for this stuff is _long_. Short term velocity gains are just one variable to watch. Anyway, all my rambling aside, I absolutely agree that LLMs are both revolutionary and useful.

This is just randomly off the top of my head, you can find many more. None of them claim that agentic coding does a years' worth of work for them in an hour, of course. In addition, pretty much every developer I know has used some form of GenAI or agentic coding over the last year, and they all say it gives them some form of speed up, most of them significant. The \"AI doesn't help me\" crowd is, as far as I can tell, an online-only phenomenon. In real life, everyone has used it to at least some degree and finds it very valuable. reply",

[...] Can you provide data that objects this view\" part of parents comment. This stuff is really, really hard. Social science is very difficult as there's a lot of variance in human ability/responses. Added to that is the variance surrounding setup and tool usage (claude code vs aider vs gemini vs codex etc). Like, there's a good reason why social scientists try to use larger samples from a population, and get very nerdy with stratification et al. This stuff is difficult otherwise. The gold standard (rather like the METR study) is multiple people with random assignment to tasks with a large enough sample of people/tasks that lots of the random variance gets averaged out. On a 1 person sample level, it's almost impossible to get results as good as this. You can eliminate the person level variance (because it's just one person), but I think you'd need maybe 100 trials/tasks to get a good estimate. Personally, that sounds really implausible, and even if you did accomplish this, I'd be sceptical of the results as one would expect a learning effect (getting better at both using LLM tools and side projects in general). The simple answer here (to your original question) is no, you probably can't measure this yourself as you won't have enough data or enough controls around the collection of this data to make accurate estimates. To get anywhere near a good estimate you'd need multiple developers and multiple tasks (and a set of people to rate the tasks such that the average difficulty remains constant. Actually, I take that back. If you work somewhere with lots and lots of non-leetcode interview questions (take homes etc) you could probably do the study I suggested internally. If you were really interested in how this works for professional development, then you could randomise at the level of interviewee and track those that made it through and compare to output/reviews approx 1 year later. But no, there's no quick and easy way to do this because the variance is way too high. > Do you think trashb who made the initial question above would take the results of such evaluation and say \"Yeah, that's good enough and answers my question\"? I actually think trashb would have been OK with my original study, but obviously that's just my opinion. reply",

          "text": "To wrap this up, what I was trying to say is that the feeling of being faster may not align with the reality. Even for people that have a good understanding of the matter it may be difficult to estimate. So I would say be skeptical of claims like this and try to somehow quantize it in a way that matters for the tasks you do. This is something managers of software projects have been trying to tackling for a while now. There is no exact measurement in this case but you could get an idea by testing certain types of implementations. For example if you are finishing similar tasks on average 25% faster during a longer testing period with and without AI. Just the act of timing yourself doing tasks with or without AI may already give a crude indication of the difference. You could also run a trail implementing coding tasks like leet code however you will introduce some kind of bias due to having done it previously. And additionally the tasks may not align with your daily activities. A trail with multiple developers working on the same task pool with or without AI could lead to more substantial results but you won't be able to do that by yourself. reply",

          "text": "You haven't provided a sample either... But sure, lets dig in. > Antirez When I first read his recent article, I found the whole article, uncompelling. https://antirez.com/news/158 (don't buy into the anti-AI hype) But gave it a 2nd chance; and re-read it. I'm gonna have to resist going line by line, because I find some of it outright objectionable. > Whatever you believe about what the Right Thing should be, you can't control it by refusing what is happening right now. Skipping AI is not going to help you or your career. Setting aside the rhetorical/argumentative deficiencies, and the fact this is just FUD because (he next suggests if you disagree, just keep trying it every few months? which suggests to me even he knows it's BS). He writes that in the context of the ethical or moral objections he raises. So he's suggesting that the best way to advance in your career, is to ignoring the social and ethical concerns and just get on board? Gross. Individual careers aside, I'm not impressed by the correctness of the code emitted, by AI and committed by most AI users. I'm unconvinced that AI will improve the industry, and it's reputation as a whole. But the topic is supposed to be specific examples of code, so lets do that. He mentions adding utf-8 to his toy terminal input project -> https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/commit/c12b66d25508bd70... It's a very useful feature to add, without a doubt! His library is better than it was before. But parsing utf-8, while something that's very easy to implement without care, or incompletely, i.e. something that's very easy to trip over if you're careless. The implementation specifics of it are fairly described as a solved problem. It's been done so many times, if you're willing to re-implement from another existing source, It wouldn't take very long to do this without AI. (And if you're not, why are you using AI? I'm ethically opposed to the laundered provenience of source material) Then, it absolutely would take more time to verify that the code is correct if you did it by hand. The thing everyone keeps telling me I have to ensure that the AI hasn't made a mistake, so either I trust the vibes, or I'm still spending that time. Even Simon Willison agrees with me[1]. > Simon Willison Is another suggested, so he's perfect to go next. I normally would exclude someone who's clearly best know as an AI influencer, but he's without a doubt an engineer too to fair game. Especially given he's answered a similar question just recently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46582192 I've been searching for a counter point to my personal anti-AI hype, so was eager to see what the experts are making.... it's all boilerplate. I don't mean to say there's nothing valuable or that there's nothing useful there. Only that the vast majority of the code in these repos, is boilerplate that has no use out of context. The real value is just a few lines of code, something that I believe would only take 30m if you wrote the code without AI for the project you were already working on. It'd take a few hours to make any of this myself (assuming I'm even good enough to figure it out). And I do admit, 10m on BART vs 3-4hours on a weekend is a very significant time delta. But also, I like writing code. So what was I really gonna do with that time? Make share holder value go up no doubt! > Linus Torvalds I can't find a single source where he's an advocate for AI. I've seen the commit, and while some of the github comments are gold. I wasn't able to draw any meaningful conclusions from the commit in isolation. Especially not when the last I read about it, he used it because he doesn't write python code. So I don't know what conclusions there are I can pull from this commit, other than AI can emit code. I knew that. I don't have enough context to comment on the opinions of Steve Yegge or his AI generated output. I simply don't know enough, and after a quick search nothing other than AI influencer jumped out at me. Then I try to care about who I give my time and attention to, or who I associate  with so this is the end of list. I contrast these, examples with all the hype that's proven over and over to be a miscommunication if I'm being charitable, or an outright lie if I'm not. I also think it's important to consider the incentives leading to these \"miscommunications\" when evaluating how much good faith you assign them. On top of that, there's the countless examples of AI confidently lying to me about something. Explaining my fundamental concrete objection to being lied to; would take another hour I shouldn't spend on a HN comment. What specific examples of impressive things/projects/commits/code am I missing? What output, makes all the downsides of AI a worthwhile trade off? > In addition, pretty much every developer I know has used some form of GenAI or agentic coding over the last year, and they all say it gives them some form of speed up I remember reading something that when tested, they're not actually faster.

I am working on a HPC project[1] that requires more careful architectural thinking. Trying to let the LLM do the whole task most often fail, or produce low quality code (even with top models like Opus 4.5). What works well though is \"assisted\" coding. I am usually writing the interface code (e.g. headers in C++) with some help from the agent, and then let the LLM do the actual implementation of these functions/methods. Then I do final adjustments. Writing a good AGENTS.md helps a lot. I might be 30% faster on these tasks.

I've had huge success with agents, but only on existing apps that were architected by humans and have established conventions and guardrails. Agents are really bad at architecture, but quite good at following suit. Other things that seem to contribute to success with agents are: - Static type systems (not tacked-on like Typescript) - A test suite where the tests cover large swaths of code (i.e. not just unit testing individual functions; you want e2e-style tests, but not the flaky browser kind) With all the above boxes ticked, I can get away with only doing \"sampled\" reviews. I.e. I don't review every single change, but I do review some of them. And if I find anything weird that I had missed from a previous change, I to tell it to fix it and give the fix a full review. For architectural changes, I plan the change myself, start working on it, then tell the agent to finish. reply",

You have to tell it to use async where possible, to do proper error handling and logging, xml comments above complex methods and so on. It works really well once you got it figured out. It also helps to give it separate but focussed tasks, so I have a todo.txt file that it can read to keep track of tasks. Basically you have to be strict with it. I cannot imagine how people trust outputs for python/javascript as there are no strong typing or compilers involved, maybe some linting rules that can save you. Maybe Typescript with strict mode can work but then you have to be a purest about it and watch it like a hawk, which will drain you fast. C# + claude code works really well. reply",

          "text": "Upvote. That's my experience too. Agent coding works really well for existing codebases that are well-structured and organized. If your codebase is mostly spaghetti—without clear boundaries and no clear architecture in place—then agents won't be of much help. They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results. Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives. The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it). This is where I see clear efficiency gains. reply",

Looked at the code, and wouldn't you know they let the LLM decide... Once started down this path, I knew I was going to need something for isolated exec envs. I ended up building something I think is quite awesome on Dagger. Let's me run in containers without running containers, can get a diff or rewind history, can persist and share wvia any OCI registry. So on one hand, I needed something and chose a technology that would offer me interesting possibilities, and on the other I wanted to have features I don't expect the likes of Microsoft to deliver with Copilot, only one of which is my sandbox setup. I'm not sure I would call it rolling my own completely, I'm building on established technology (OCI, OCR) I don't expect a standard to arise, OCI is already widely adopted and makes sense, but there are other popular techs and there will be a ton of reimplementations by another name/claim. The other half of this is that AI providers are likely to want to run and charge money for this, I personally expect more attempts at vendor lock in in this space. In example, Anthropic bought Bun and I anticipate some product to come of this, isolation and/or canvas related reply",

I mainly work in Python, and I've been ensuring that all of my projects have a test suite which runs cleanly with \"uv run pytest\" - using a dev dependency group to ensure the right dependencies are installed. This means I can run Claude Code against any of my repos and tell it \"run 'uv run pytest', then implement ...\" - which is a shortcut for having it use TDD and write tests for the code it's building, which is essential for having coding agents produce working code that they've tested before they commit. Once this is working well I can drop ideas directly into the Claude app on my iPhone and get 80% of the implementation of the idea done by the time I get back to a laptop to finish it off. I wrote a bit about \"uv run pytest\" and dependency groups here: https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups reply",

          "text": "The biggest principle is codification. Codify everything. For instance, this skill of web development: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-... That’s too much for a model to carry in its context while it’s trying to do actual work. Far better is to give that skill.md to a model and have it produce several hundred lines of code with a shebang at the top. Now you haven’t got a skill, you’ve got a script. And it’s a script the model can run any time to check its work, without knowing what the script does, how, or why - it just sees the errors. Now all your principles of web dev can be checked across your codebase in a few hundred milliseconds while burning zero tokens. TDD is codification too: codifying in executable form the precise way you want your logic to work. Enforce a 10ms timeout on every unit test and as a side effect your model won’t be able to introduce I/O or anything else that prevents parallel, randomized execution of your test suite. It’s awesome to be able to run ALL the tests hundreds of times per day. Constantly checking your UI matches your design system? Have the model write a script that looks at your frontend codebase and refuses to let the model commit anything that doesn’t match the design system. Codification is an insanely powerful thing to build into your mindset. reply",

When I don't know what I want to do, I read existing code, think about it, and figure it out. Sometimes I'll sketch out ideas by writing code, then when I have something I like I'll get Claude to take my sketch as an example and having it go forward. The big mistake I see people make is not knowing when to quit. Even with Opus 4.5 it still does weird things, and I've seen people end up arguing with Claude or trying to prompt engineer their way out of things when it would have been maybe 30 seconds of work to fix things manually. It's like people at shopping malls who spend 15 minutes driving in the parking lot to find a spot close to the door when they could have parked in the first spot they saw and walked to the door in less than a minute. And as always, every line of code was written by me even if it wasn't written by me. I'm responsible for it, so I review all of it. If I wouldn't have written it on my own without AI assistance I don't commit it. reply",

          "text": "On the other side of the equation I've been spending much more time on code-review on an open source project I maintain, because developers are much more productive and I still code-review at the same speed. The real issue is that I can't trust the AI generated code, or trust the AI to code-review for me. Some repeated issues I see: - In my experience the AI doesn't integrate well with the code that there is already there: it often rewrites functionality and tend not to adhere to the project's conventions, but rather use what it is trained on. - The AI often lacks depth into more complex issues. And because it doesn't see the broader implication of changes, it often doesn't write the tests that would cover them. Developers that wrote the PRs accept the AI tests without much investigation into the code-base. Since the changes passes the (also insufficient) tests, they send the PR to code-review. - With AI I think (?) I'm more often the one careful deep diving into the project and re-designing the generated code in the code-review. In a way it's an indirect re-prompting. I'm very happy with the increased PRs: they push the project forward, with great ideas of what to implement, and I'm very happy about AI increased productivity. Also, with AI developers are bolder in their contributions. But this doesn't scale -- or I'll spend all my time code-reviewing :) I hope the AIs get better quickly. reply",

          "text": "Instead of building features from scratch, I basically rebuilt my open-source alternatives project[0] from five years ago to track features right in the code itself. So if you spot an open-source project with a feature you want in your app, you can create a \"skill\" that points exactly to where it lives: specific files, functions, modules, plus docs and notes. This turns OSS into a modular cookbook you can pull from across stacks. AI excels at finding the \"seams,\" those spots where a feature connects to the underlying tech stack, and figuring out how the feature is really implemented. You might think just asking Claude or Cursor to grab a feature from a repo works, but in practice they often miss pieces because key code can be scattered in unexpected places. Our skills fix that by giving structured, complete guides so the AI ports it accurately. For example, if an e-commerce platform has payments built in and you need payments in your software, you can reference the exact implementation and adapt it reliably.

The first saves me days of work/month by sparing me endless paper pages of notes trying to figure out why things work in a certain way in legacy work codebases. The second spares me from having to dig too much in partially outdated or lacking documentation or having to melt my brain understanding the architecture of every different dependency. So I just put major deps in my projects in a `_vendor` directory that contains the source code of the dependencies and if I have doubts LLMs dig into it and their test to shed light. What I haven't seen anybody yet accomplish is produce quality software by having AI write them. I'm not saying they can't help here, but the bottleneck is still reviewing and as soon as you get sloppy, codebase quality goes south, and the product quality follows soon after. reply",

Blindly accepting generates technical debt faster than you can imagine. Where it really shines is the tedious stuff - writing tests for edge cases, refactoring patterns across multiple files, generating boilerplate that follows existing conventions. Things that would take me 45 minutes of context-switching I can knock out in 5.

          "text": "I have similar observations. The time saved is things like going to some library I wrote to find the exact order of parameters, or looking up some API on the internet and adjusting my code to it. Inevitably if I did that the old way, I would screw up something trivial and get annoyed. I rarely let it run for over 10 minutes unattended, but the benefits are not just pure time. Being able to change the code without getting bogged down allows you to try more things. If I have to wait half an hour between iterations, I'm going to run into bedtime quite fast. On top of this, I'm finding that the thing that takes the deepest attention is often, amazingly, trivial things. Fiddling with a regex takes attention, but it doesn't often decide the success of the project. By contrast, the actual work, which is making technical decisions, is something I can do without concentrating in the same way. It's strange that the higher value thing feels less stressful. Put these together and I'm more productive. I can string together a bunch of little things, and not have to be at my sharpest. Work can be scheduled for whenever, which means days are more flexible. More gets done, with less attention. reply",

          "text": "Pretty similar here. Another thing I keep thinking is a phrase pilots use when flying airplanes using FMSes and autopilot: \"never fly your airplane to a place you haven't already been to in your mind\" - that is, don't ever just sit back and let the automation work, stay a step ahead of the automation and drop down to less automation when you aren't certain that it is doing the right thing. When you send Claude Code something and already have an idea for what an acceptable solution looks like, you're a massive step ahead when it's time to read the diff and decide what you think of it. This does mean that every so often my productivity drops to basically zero as I try to understand what is actually happening before I just put the AI on the job, but so far it seems to be a good rule to keep in mind that allows me to use AI effectively while generating a code base that I still understand. reply",

The issue is that it's usually faster to just read the documentation and write the code yourself. Depending on what you're working on of course. Like with the yaml, a LLM can write you an ingress config in a second or two from a very short prompt. It can do similar things with Python if you specify exactly how you want something and what dependencies you want. That's being bad at programming in my opinion. You can mitigate it a lot with how you config you agents. Mine loads our tech stack. The best practices we've decided to use. The fact that I value safety first but am otherwise a fan of the YAGNI philosophy and so on. I spent a little time and build these things into my personal agent on our enterprise AI plan, and I use it a lot. I still have to watch it like a hawk, but I do think it's a great tool. I guess you could say that your standard LLM will write better Python than I did 10 years ago, but that's not really good enough when you work on systems which can't fail. It's fine on 90% (I made this number up) of software though. reply",

The thing I should have made clearer is probably that I think the horrible code is great. Yes it's bad, but it's also a ton of services and automation which would not have been made before LLM's, because there wouldn't have been enough developer time for it. Now it being terrible code doesn't mean the sollution itself is terrible for the business. You don't need software engineering until you do, and compute is really cheap on this scale. What do we care their code runs up €5 a year if it adds thousands of euros worth of value? It's only when something stops working. Usually because what started out as a small thing grows into something where it can't scale that we take over. reply",

LLMs seem to degrade a lot when they are forced to work on existing code bases (even their own). What seems to be more a issue with context sizes growing out of control way too fast (and this is what degrades LLMs the most). So far Opus 4.5 has been the one LLM that keeps mostly coding in a, how to say, predictable way even with a existing code base. It requires scaffolding and being very clear with your coding requests. But not like the older models where they go off script way too much or rewrite code in their own style. For me Opus 4.5 has reached that sweet spot of productivity and not just playing around with LLMs and undoing mistakes. The problem with LLMs is a lot of times a mix of LLM issues, people giving different requests, context overload, different models doing better with different languages, the amount of data it needs to alter etc... This makes the results very mixed from one person to another, and harder to quantify. Even the different in a task makes the difference between a person one day glorifying a LLM and a few weeks later complaining it was nerfed, when it was not. Just people doing different work / different prompts and ... reply",

I have \"you will use the shared code <here>\" twice in my CLAUDE.md as it will constantly write duplicate code. Something that is also annoying is that if it moves some code somewhere with the intent to slightly modify it I've seen it delete the code, then implement from scratch, and then modify it to what it has been specified to do.

I tweak the generated code by hand (faster than talking with the agent), then switch back to plan mode and ask for specific tests. I almost always need to clean up the tests for doing way too much manual setup, despite a lot of Claude.md instructions to the contrary. In the end, I probably get the work done in 30% less wall-clock time of Claude implementing (counting plan time), but I’m also doing other things while the agent crunches.

The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform. Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies. So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops! I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole. reply",

Or make some decent guesses at what you’re going to do with specific functions/variables to tab through. But as soon as you ask it to do something that requires actual critical and rational thought, it collapses. Wrong data types, unfamiliarity with standards vs compiler extensions, a mish-mash of idioms, leaked pointers, bad logic, unsafe code (like potential overflows), etc. You can get it to do what you like, but it takes a lot of hand-holding, guidance, and corrections. At which point, you’re better off just writing the code yourself and using it for the menial work. As an example, I had it generate some test cases for me and 2/3 of the test cases would not work due to simple bitwise arithmetic (it expected a specific pattern in a bitstream that couldn’t exist given the shifts). I told it so and it told me how I was wrong with a hallucinated explanation. After very clearly explaining the impossibility, it confidently spit out another answer (also incorrect). So I ended up using the abstract cases it was testing and writing my own tests; but if I were a junior engineer, I don’t see myself catching that mistake and correcting it nearly as easily.

          "text": "It occurs to me that \"write a C program that [problem description]\" is an extremely under-constrained task. People are highly aware that C++ programmers are always using some particular subset of C++; but it's not as obvious that any actual C programmer is actually going to use a particular dialect on top of C. Since the C standard library is so anemic for algorithms and data structures, any given \"C programmer\" is going to have a hash map of choice, a b-tree of choice, a streams abstraction of choice, an async abstraction of choice, etc. And, in any project they create, they're going to depend on (or vendor in) those low-level libraries. Meanwhile, any big framework-ish library (GTK, OpenMP, OpenSSL) is also going to have its own set of built-in data structures that you have to use to interact with it (because it needs to take and return such data-structures in its API, and it has to define them in order to do that.) Which often makes it feel more correct, in such C projects, to use that framework's abstractions throughout your own code, rather than also bringing your own favorite ones and constantly hitting the impedance wall of FFI-ing between them. It's actually shocking that, in both FOSS and hiring, we expect \"experienced C programmers\" who've worked for 99% of their careers with a dialect of C consisting of abstractions from libraries E+F+G, to also be able to jump onto C codebases that instead use abstractions from libraries W+X+Y+Z (that may depend on entirely different usage patterns for their safety guarantees!), look around a bit, and immediately be productively contributing. It's no wonder an AI can't do that. Humans can barely do it! My guess is that the performance of an AI coding agent on a greenfield C project would massively improve if you initially prompt it (or instruct it in an AGENTS.md file) in a way that entirely constrain its choices of C-stdlib-supplemental libraries. Either by explicitly listing them; or by just saying e.g. \"Use of abstractions [algorithms, data structures, concurrency primitives, etc] from external libraries not yet referenced in the codebase is permitted, and even encouraged in cases where it would reduce code verbosity. Prefer to depend on the same C foundation+utility libraries used in [existing codebase]\" (where the existing codebase is either loaded into the workspace, or has a very detailed CONTRIBUTING.md you can point the agent at.) reply",

It's wild: in the video you linked it's explained COBOL was meant for machines that don't exist anymore so COBOL is running inside emulators. So you have Java code, generating COBOL code, that's then run on an emulator emulating an old IBM system that was meant to run COBOL. It's just wild . Some of the tools are even front-facing users (bank employees): at times you can still see at some banks an employee running an app in a monochrome green-on-black text terminal emulator that is basically COBOL. It's weird, just weird. But legacy code is legacy code. And if you think COBOL's legacy is bad, Java is going to dwarf COBOL's legacy big times (for Java is typically used at the kind of places that still use COBOL and it's used way more than COBOL). So in the future, heck, we may have a new language, generating, inside an emulator emulating current machines/OSes, Java code that is going to be code generating COBOL code (!), that's then going to be run in an emulator. reply",

I designed and built the front-end (windows applications, a telephone banking system, and a home-banking web thing) and middle-tier systems (VB.NET-based services). The real back-end, though, was  an old COBOL system. I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language. I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong). reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hello :-)<p>I have a Discord server I set up a long time ago. Around 2016 I think. Back then, it was lively and active and loads of fun. Over time it's developed close to 5,000 members (it actually had over 5,000 members at one point) and currently has 501 members online as I type this. It's more likely there's about 10-15 that are paying attention to anything happening.<p>It's a Discord that originally focused on DevOps. It complemented my YouTube channel on the same topic, but since then, as it's slowly died out, and my channel's focus as shifted and changed, it's become a bit of a waste land.<p>It's a shame really, because a really fun Discord server can be a great place to be, but I'm not sure where to take it now.<p>How would you handle this situation? What would be your approach to reviving the Discord and perhaps trying to get a community of like minded hackers going again in 2026?<p>I won't link the Discord here as I'm not trying to beg for users or spam. I just genuinely want to work on a solution to improve the life of the server. I will put it in my HN profile, though, so if you do want to check it out that extra step is required.<p>Are people even interested in Discord servers any more? I don't know.<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Are you posting your videos to them? Do people have things to say about the new focus?) Most of what keeps a Discord active or not is content and having things to chat about. You list things in an order that suggests the chat started to slowly die and then your channel's focus shifted, but maybe it was the other way around and not as much as of the audience that had found their way through the Discord followed you through the channel refocus as you expected? reply",

          "text": "These days the out-of-the-box automod and autospam prevention tools in Discord are generally good enough you probably don't need third party bots to do it (unless the community gets particularly huge, and even then maybe not). Most bots are now for entertainment more than community management when the Discord is configured right. The biggest trick to getting access to most of those built-in features is that it needs to be marked as a \"Community Server\" [1], so expect to put in the effort to meeting those requirements and getting Discord certified on them. Most of them are good practices in general , especially for something you are trying to present as a public, professional face of your company. Also, I don't think any moderation tools are currently gated behind Server Boosts/Levels, but it may also be worth budgeting for buying a Server Level or two [2]. Most of the reasons to budget for that are marketing and comfort. If you plan to do things like Live Q&A or screensharing events, having the better audio/video capabilities of higher levels can be useful. The custom header for Discord Invites is often a marketing tool to help assuage users seeing the invites that it is indeed the right official community. (Some of the moderation tools were previewed at higher Server Levels, and it does seem like something Discord takes into account when testing various new, desirable features.) (ETA: Also, automoderation only gets you so far in general, you may still want to budget for the labor of real moderators as well, no matter how good you think you can configure the automod tools.)

(One alleged place where it came from was communities migrating from TeamSpeak where \"server\" was the word there, which would make sense as a particular place it came from given the early focus on game players. Another alleged source was some huge non-technical communities that were also early adopters of Discord.) I sort of prefer \"guilds\" for technical reasons, too, and also from enough work on Discord bot development where that terminology is far more common because it is in all the API documentation. But I think a lot of that ship has sailed for non-technical reasons of \"it is just how everyone talks about Discord\". (Also, technically Discord does shard the heaviest \"guilds\" in its server clusters in such a way that the technical resemblance to \"server\" isn't far off if you want to feel better about the non-technical \"server\" terminology.) reply",

Depth first search via recursive dispatch is my current go-to strategy. This requires a fully serialized chain of operations. Not even tool calls are allowed to run in parallel. One agent and one action at a time. That's it. This does feel really slow at first, but in practice it seems to converge on high quality solutions more quickly than breadth first techniques which leverage parallelism and more tokens. The solution itself might not be the most ideal, but we find it very quickly and with a great deal of consistency. This means we can iterate more rapidly and with more certainty. Just because we can consume $100 of tokens in 60 seconds doesn't mean we should try to.  I think trying to go fast is what's burning a lot of people out on AI. There's a ton of value in here if we can slow down and be a little bit more deliberate about it. reply",

I have multiple projects and if I feel I have capacity to do parallel coding, I do it in unrelated code bases. Sometimes I do super async work   - as in one interaction per hour or so.

          "text": "using them. there really is no other way. It's like asking \"how do I use my text editor\". Almost everything you read online will be out of date, and the person working on it won't work the same way you do. Some people love it, some people hate it. And unless you've got your own experience, it's hard applying other people's experience to your experience. Especially for something like Claude Code where you're just prompting and getting results back. I mean, half the time I use VS Code, half the time I use a terminal window. You're going to get a lot of conflicting advice because everyone's environment is different and they work on different sorts of code bases. But I'll give you mine. I'm a Claude Max Pro 200 subscriber. I sit with the Opus chat-bot have a discussion and come up with a spec. We turn this into a zip full of documents and upload it to a GitHub Repo. e.g. https://github.com/lawless-m/BattleForMoscow I'll then get Claude Code for the Web to go to that repo unzip the zip and read the documents. It will make a first pass at the entire codebase. I'll merge that into main and create another Claude Code for the Web Opus session with any ideas I've had in the meantime - which will usually be a few. Then I clone it to a local machine and get Claude Code Opus to try and get it to work. And I'll prompt it from there until it works. If it's a Linux program, that'll be in a terminal window. If it's Windows, I'll use VS Code because it's a better terminal in VS Code than it is in a terminal window on Windows. That's a general workflow. Sometimes I won't use GitHub at all. Sometimes a PXE boot an entire Linux machine and give it that with admin privs. And sometimes I just tell it to use sudo as my own account. On my router for instance, if we want to do things with the firewall. reply",

Apps that scale beyond that tend to either crash, burn, and get shut down... or they find professionals who take over the app, refactor the warts, fix it up, and maintain the app on an ongoing basis. It all depends on whether the app is bringing in enough revenue or other business value to be able to afford such professional support.

They cant even use a USB without getting approval. Software must come from our internal software repo and we run updates so often that known mac haters beg for macs to escape the win11 hell we've created. Its awful and I feel gross helping manage such a user hostile environment. Yesterday our update tool shutdown someones computer in the middle of a important action. It prompted him 3 times with 15min intervals then shut down his pc. He was going berserk as he lost a lot of progress. Most of this is because of the strict compliance requirements our security team enforces on us. But some of it is done because we dont know how to implement the stuff in a way that is strict but lenient. Mac is way better because we dont have as much invasive tooling that supports it. reply",

Now with AI able to explain minified code in seconds, I'm wondering if attitudes are shifting.<p>If you own any web apps or games, do you genuinely care about protecting client-side code? If not, why? If yes, what do you use — or why don't existing tools work for you?<p>(Context: I'm building www.afterpack.dev — but genuinely want to understand if this is a problem people actually have or if it's rather a very niche problem)</p></p></p></div>",
