          "text": "I think this is the wrong question. The right question is how much human code can a human push now vs prior to AI. Everything we've done in coding has been assisted. Prior to this current generation of web applications, we had the advent of concepts like Object Orientated Programming and prior to that even C was a massive move up from Assembly and punch cards. AI has written a lot of code. AI has written very little high velocity production code by itself (ie. for people with no coding background). In Ruby on Rails, the concept of fast coding has been around for over 20 years, look up this concept of Scaffolding: https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/ So to answer your question, 1. AI has pushed a lot of code\n2. AI has pushed almost no code without the oversight of human software engineers\n3. Software engineers are pushing a magnitude more code and producing more functional utility and solving more bugs than ever before I don't know what the future holds, but I do think that this is not a new trend to use software to help humans build faster, and I don't think software has the ability to fully replace humans (yet). reply",

Roll to disbelieve on this one. There's no way that creating something like WordPress 20 years ago, before any modern-day web application frameworks, was anywhere near as easy. I'm not even talking React/Next or whatever - this was before RoR, before Django (or at least very early versions of both). I think it's pretty impossible to look around and not notice that technical advances have improved a lot of things in the world - why does it sound credible that programming itself hasn't improved at all in twenty years? Even look at languages like C++ today compared to 20 years ago, they're massively different - do you think all those changes to the languages are neutral or negative in terms of productivity? reply",

I just didn't think we were talking about that aspect, just how long it takes to actually build the code of WordPress. You might be saying that making the technical-building aspects of most technical products go faster won't necessarily have as big an impact as many programmers believe. Programming isn't the core of most products to the degree most programmers think, and instead the core of most products/companies is more about product thinking, sales & marketing, etc. I agree with this sentiment a lot. That aside, I think there's no question it's faster to program in Python or C++ right now, than it was 20 years ago.

There is a big difference between AI autonomously writing code and developers just finding it easier to prompt changes rather than typing them manually. In one case, you have an automated software engineer, and may be able to reduce your headcount. In the other, developers may just be slightly more productive or even just enjoy writing code using AI more, but the coding is still very much driven by the developers themselves.

You still need developers to be able to translate the business context into instructions that make the right product. You have to engage with the product. You need to architect the system - the context windows mean that the tasks can't just be handed off to AI.

However, developer efficiency isn't the only metric a company like Anthropic would care about, after all they're trying to build the best coding assistant with Claude Code. So for them understanding the failure cases, and the prompting need to recover from those failures is likely more important than just lines of code their developers are producing per hour.

Nowadays, this is not the case any more as people order replacement parts for whatever metal piece that broke in your car, house, etc. The metal molding happens in factories instead. But in order you still need to have people who know how to mold metals. The early folks for this profession were blacksmiths. Nowadays you would not call them any more. But it's definitely been \"engineers with AI\". Same goes for industrialized food. The huge industrial bakeries still employ people who know how to bake bread, but they can do 1000x more than they could do if they had to knead the dough on their own, separate it, form little pieces of bread, order it nicely on a tray, etc. Now it's a machine doing most pieces of work, but they still have folks who design new bread products, adjust machines, know what to change in the formula if one particular product from one particular supplier is not available in the quantities needed, etc. A lot of the skills needed aligns enough with the traditional job of a baker that these factories employ actual bakers. As for software, whenever I use AI tools, I don't really feel that they help me save time much. But it's entirely possible that this is going to change in the future.

          "text": "I don't work for OpenAI and I doubt some random employee is going to come here and share what is likely a secret. I'm in the industry though so I have some idea of what's going on these days, both where I work and more broadly. AI is getting better at writing code. However writing code is just some fraction of the work of many software engineers. AI doesn't work independently, it needs to be guided, its work needs to be reviewed, tested etc. There are some domains where it does better and some domains where it doesn't. There's a range of \"AI\" work between auto-complete style work, assisting in understanding a code base, and writing code from some spec or doing other types work. All in all I would say it's a decent improvement to productivity for many situations. It's really hard to say how much and it's also not a zero sum game, as productivity improves there's more work. Something to keep in mind is that if you look at a modern software project likely most of the code executing is not code written by the developers of that project. There's a huge stack of open source bits executing for almost any new project. Specifically in OpenAI you also need to consider what type of software they are likely writing. Some of it may be more or less \"vanilla\" code and other is likely very specialized/performance critical. The vanilla code like API wrappers or simple front end pieces is likely more amenable to be written by AI whereas the more cutting edge algorithmic/scheduling/optimization work is almost certainly not done by AI. At least yet. As software organizations become larger there's a lot of overhead and waste. It is possible that AI can enable smaller teams and that has a multiplicative effect because it lets you reduce that waste/overhead. There are likely also software engineers who will become better/adapt to new workflows and some who will not. It's really hard to say where things are going but overall my sense is that this like many other innovations will lead to more software and more jobs and not the other way around. There are many moving pieces here, not just AI itself but geopolitics, macro-economics, etc. Where are those new jobs going to get created, what new types of software/technology are going to be created etc. etc. History seems to show us that we'll adapt/evolve and grow. reply",

I doubt that very much. I think the difference between situations where AI-driven development works and doesn't is going to be largely down to the quality of the engineers who are supervising and prompting to generate that code, and the degree to which they manually evaluate it before moving it forward. I think you'll find that good engineers who understand what they're telling an agent to do are still extremely valuable, and are unlikely to go anywhere in the short to mid term. AI tools are not yet at the point where they are reliable on their own, even for systems they helped build, and it's unclear whether they will be any time soon purely through model scaling (though it's possible). I think you can see the realities of AI tooling in the fact that the major AI companies are hiring lots and lots of engineers, not just for AI-related positions, but for all sorts of general engineering positions. For example, here's a post for a backend engineer at OpenAI: https://openai.com/careers/backend-software-engineer-leverag... - and one from Anthropic: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4561280008 . Note that neither of these require direct experience with using AI coding agents, just an interest in the topic! Contrast that with many companies who now demand engineers explain how they are using AI-driven workflows. When they are being serious about getting people to do the work that will make them money, rather than engaging in marketing hype, AI companies are honest: AI agents are tools, just like IDEs, version control systems, etc. It's up to the wise engineer to use them in a valuable way. Is it possible they're just hiring these folks to try and make their models better to later replace those people? It's possible. But I'm not sure when in time, if ever, they'll reach the point where that was viable. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

That'll get you fired from PetSmart, let alone some bullshit $250k/yr software job. I think startups' freewheeling management and hiring practices need examined because this would be caught by the most basic of background or reference checks at any traditional business.

You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.

Technically there is always a contract between any two parties who are cooperating; it doesn’t have to be formalized in any particular way as long as the cooperating parties have a common understanding of the terms and agree on them. Many companies that don’t use formal contracts instead put all the information that is common to all employees into an employee handbook, and the details that are unique to a specific employee into the offer letter. The offer letter given to a new hire has details such as their starting salary and start date, and once they arrive they are given a copy of the handbook and often time to read it and discuss it with a manager. The handbook will explain in detail how promotions happen, the work expected from for various job titles, any rules the employees are expected to follow, etc, etc. Together these form the common understanding that underlies the contract, even if there is never a formal contract signed by both the employer and the employee. Contractors, on the other hand, always have a formal contract. Often a contractor spends a significant amount of their time negotiating these contracts, especially the scope of work.

Fix THAT problem, and you solve a myriad of other related problems for entire populations.\nCharacter questions are forbidden in the USA as they might lead to 'discrimination.' But 'discrimination' is where one discerns a preference between something desirable and something undesirable? \nHistorically the abuse of 'discrimination' created the legal restrictions that foster this situation where a candidate's character cannot be assessed accurately.\nSoham proves that the people doing the interviewing are less discerning than they believe themselves to be. Good character seldom is discerned during an interview. Also 'good' character relative; what 'Christians' or 'Westerners' consider to be good character is different from what other cultures accept or tolerate.\nIn summary, caveat emptor. reply",

You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

For example: I use Claude Code to explore options before I commit to a design. I’ll ask it “what are 3 ways to abstract this logic?” and sometimes that alone gives me a better direction. It’s pretty good at turning rough notes or comments into starter code or test cases. That saves time on boilerplate.

I’ve been descriptive and explicit in my prompting, way more so than previously. It has gotten the broad strokes right, I’ve got an exceptionally barebones DSL, made up of 5 entities, working…just. It has now started to spin its wheels on small issues and can’t fix them without breaking something else. The codebase isn’t even big (~8 main functions across a few files). Troubleshooting the code is difficult because it’s convoluted and I lack the same intuition for it I would have had I written it myself. I’ve decided to rewrite everything with less control ceded to the LLM. When it works, it feels great. When it doesn’t, which is often, the spell is broken and I feel I’ve wasted a bunch of time and have not much to show for it. reply",

I mean it will generate something, which will probably work, but the solution can often be over-engineered, or hacky. I think we have to build up enough code for it to start appearing like brownfield, before Claude knows how to engineer correctly. Which kind of makes sense if we view Claude Code as a junior engineer with infinite stamina. I also actually like to spin up Claude Code and Gemini in parallel to see what each one comes up with. Gemini will often do the simpler approach, but not often fully featured, and my solution often ends up taking the 2 solutions and refining in Cursor to come up with the final solution. reply",

Unless you had only the most mainstream generic usage in mind, there was not published code nor commercial software to address your particular ambitions and everybody knew you would have to write your own programs. Programming was never expected to be accomplished by everybody , rather by anybody who wanted to, whenever they felt like it. So naturally you were supposed to always be able to buy a new computer, take it out of the box, put it on the desk and start programming.  No other monkey business or friction of any kind, you just plug it in and go.  Anything less would be stupid as shinola. Of course the majority of buyers were not as ready to program as their PC's were capable, it had always been like that and of course most people got the most use out of their machines without having to write any code themselves. But anybody anywhere was still supposed to be able to sit down at any decent computer, turn it on and start programming or continue a project any time they wanted to.  Long after the box had been thrown away and the warranty had expired.  Just knowing how powerful the emerging machines were getting was pretty good incentive to purchase based on expectations, even when most buyers had no programming background at all they knew that was the only way to make the PC do what they really wanted.  But the widespread attitude was that once the PC was purchased, they were already so far ahead of the curve just learning how to use it for the simple stuff, it was fine for self-programming to stay on the back burner until it can be experimented with.  Nobody thought writing useful programs was going to be \"easy\", or that just anybody would be very effective, so it made sense to approach it seriously when the time would be right and you needed it most. Well before that attitude could be allowed to continue, the rug was pulled, making sure that no PC ever again will be like a Commodore where they are all ready-to-program right out-of-the-box using the same basic language & interface across-the-board.  Who would or would not benefit the most if all PC's would have retained the inbuilt \"amateur\" programming language and inherent ability to frictionlessly share personal programs that came along with it? Line numbers would have been worth it to this day :\\ reply",

          "text": "When we started our voice AI company 8 years ago, the first customers came from doing a ton of free consulting work. We'd reach out to companies in target industries and offer to analyze their customer service call data for free, then show them what voice AI could do with their actual data. It felt like being taken advantage of sometimes, honestly. We'd spend weeks building custom demos and proof-of-concepts without any guaranteed return. But when you don't have a network in the industry, you have to do that kind of work to prove your credibility. The breakthrough was realizing we weren't just giving away free work - we were learning what these companies actually needed vs what we thought they needed. Those free consulting projects taught us more about product-market fit than any survey could have. By the time we had 10 real paying customers, we'd probably done free work for 30+ companies. The key was setting boundaries about when to transition from free to paid. You have to judge that timing yourself based on the relationship and how much value you're providing. reply",

          "text": "My experience:  I've had a service called HRM.monster, the domain is up for renewal on the 19th of this month, and am thinking on letting it lapse, for a name change - it is off a product called HRMgo, I have had 0 users since the purchase a year ago, and spent $750 for it from a Flippa ad thinking I hit the money spot.  Eventually ended up finding out that the software was $69 package download and not custom built, as the main website led me to believe.  I tried to build relationships with various people to gain their trust in providing services to them for a bridge to their clientele (not compete, but add additional support services), a win win with the company and their clientele.  No one wanted to talk with me.  I heard comments later-on that said I wasn't made for being in the business.  It's brutal. While my experience may be different than yours, there are other factors at play in with God having something todo with it.  There is no greater thing than word of mouth, and the house is the answer. I been trying for over a year and too chose to use email as letting clients know I existed, I didn't get anything in return. I would try talking to influencers who you think would benefit by a simple DM or email; you might want to look into LinkedIn's higher tiered contact searching for better contact specific to your demographic, and services such as audience lab if you have the ability of spending $500/mo you can get a few contact lists that have an excess of 300k+ lines of info w/ various other relevant data that you could also sell additional services to. There's also building relationships through advertising on Facebook, Google, etc., there's also vibe.co, and caasie.co... budget minded services for getting your name and caasie allows targeting specific towards your industry through video ads... where as vibe puts you on billboards. While I don't have all the answers, having something different than the crowd is also a sell, like creating a service and building that need that answers a problem you deal with at work problem; something that you could turn into a serivce, and that also is viable for other people en masse. It is really an inundation of services out there as you've stated.  The early ones caught on, had fewer people contacting them. The ones with financial backing win, because of the marketing factor, and the NEED building for the product.  The best thing is to think of a project that women need, as they're the hard core consumer.  I can't think of buying myself anything except food in the last 10 years, the occasional new pair of shoes, and slacks/shirt.  I've used the same computer for the last 10 years, and its virtually my life rn... It's best to join a chamber and sell your services to on what you can do vs your product, you sound pretty sound in the AI generated apps, so you've got that going for you, just need ideas, keep building until someone finds a need for your services, you could essentially steal someones idea, unless you end up getting requested to sign an NDA with said person if you went through the chamber. Sounds like you got a people problem though ;-) reply",

It’s a miserable tech job market right now; hunkering down and continuing to collect a paycheck is something you shouldn’t take for granted. As others have said, use this opportunity to learn about what works w/ AI based on all the crap that doesn’t.  Your C-level execs have given you carte blanche to fuck around, without worrying too much about the immediate-term consequences. If they literally said to delete existing test files & generate new ones using AI, do it! And when shit inevitably goes sideways, you’ll be able to spend more of your salaried time rewriting those tests to probably look & work more like the original tests that you deleted. And while you’re learning to use AI, you’ll be burning the company’s funny-money on AI usage fees. At some point, they’re gonna realize they don’t have a lot to show for all the money that was thrown away in service of doing what they told employees to do. At which point, they’ll take a more measured & pragmatic approach towards using AI.  Do everyone a favor & help them get to that point sooner than later. reply",

What I'd suggest is adapt to it, find ways to push back. Obviously things like \"delete entire unit test file & have claude generate a new one\" is a bad idea. I've seen claude \"monkey patching\" a system so that it returns true to the tests. This issue is going to pop up in the future. Experiment with it on the company's dime even if you've checked out emotionally. You are still doing your job - improving code quality and making sure things run. The new approach seems to be doing TDD. One, as an engineer, you'll know when AI is bullshitting you with mocks. Even when mocks are BS, you can still test the thing they're meant to represent. 2) AI spits more code than anyone can review.

My first job was in a C++ codebase, and I spent a lot of time learning the OOP design patterns (or really, the \"how do we make C++ behave well\" patterns). That said, the rise of OOP is probably measured in a decade or two. It eventually \"spawned\" whole new programming languages, that eventually got a lot of popularity. But this is over a much longer time-frame than how quickly we went from no such thing as AI coding, to (now) coding agents. It also didn't affect the entire industry in the same way - hell, some people were still writing assembly in the 80s as the OOP craze was winding up. I don't have actual stats, but I imagine coding agents are far more ubiquitious across far more industries/languages/stacks, for more quickly. > In my list I didn’t even mention the internet, the web, smartphones, and the cloud, all of which had a very broad effect on programming and programmers, The internet (or maybe the web) I'd say was probably the more transformative thing. Cloud affected a lot of things too but not quite as much and didn't make quite as big a difference to the day-to-day work. I deployed things pre-cloud and post-cloud (though honestly mostly during the early-stage cloud), and there wasn't such a big difference. Look, at the end of the day you can't just compare AI to other technologies blindly and say \"well they were big hypes, this is the same\". By actually looking at what it's doing and how it's affecting things, it's fairly clear it has a much bigger impact on the day-to-day work of programming, as opposed to anything else you mentioned. I'm not saying this is the end of development, for all I know this will mean more developers! But I think software development will look fundamentally different in 5 years in a way that is far more widespread than in any other of these changes. reply",

          "text": "I've recently started using Claude Code, and also expected to not like it (based on using Claude Web to generate some code). I have 17 years of experience. But it's actually been fantastic. It's challenging in a new way: splitting things down into small enough descriptions that the LLM don't go down a rabbit hole it can't get out of. While also giving high-level guidance to plan for the whole project. I like UI design, but implementing it is tedious and slow. With Claude I can get a dashboard page done in less than 1 min, from a spec, that I can iterate on. Instead I can focus on the parts I care about, like backend. I need to nudge it to always care about security and storage concerns. I've seen O(n²) loops where O(n) would be sufficient. It keeps making enough mistakes that I'm not exactly out of a job. The best way to use Claude Code is to write those descriptions and use examples of what you want the output to look like, so take it in small steps and do manual corrections. However, you need to have seen some good code before using it to make something good. It's just a tool, like compilers and IDEs. I'm pretty happy I don't have to input programs using eight data switches and a latch switch on an Altair 80. And I'm now pretty happy I don't have to care so much about internal API boundaries, because doing a refactoring is one sentence away. However, I do keep running out of quota after 2-2.5h out of 5h. If I had a company sponsoring this, it would be a no-brainer to use it more. reply",

Relying solely on “vibe coding” and LLM-generated code can accelerate prototyping, but usually at the cost of long-term maintainability and deep technical understanding. If leadership is actively discouraging best practices like manual testing and code review, that is a red flag, especially for a senior engineer invested in quality and growth. Personally, I had try to have a candid discussion with your CTO/CEO about your concerns and see if there’s room for a more balanced approach. If it’s clear they’re not interested and you start feeling your skills are stagnating, it’s reasonable to look for a company whose engineering values align better with yours.

          "text": "I’d stay and actually try the vibe coding, but if it’s not working, only a bit. For example, try deleting one failing unit test and re-generate it with Claude. Then if it turns out mostly worthless, scrap it and restore the original test. Maybe the entire test is correct (and easy to verify), maybe you can take pieces from it, maybe it’s unsalvageable; if it doesn’t save time, write tests manually from then on until the next major AI improvement. Worst case, CEO fires you for not vibe-coding enough. Best case, you find a way for them to make your life easier. My prediction (based on some but not much experience) is that you spend only a small amount of time trying the AI tools, occasionally they impress you, usually they fail, but even then it’s interesting and fun to see what they do. EDIT: as for dealing with the spaghetti when others use AI; wait for that to become a problem before quitting over it. And of course you can look for opportunities now. reply",

It's ok at getting the first 20% of the project done, but that was never the hard part. It's always been the last 20%, and modern LLM's simply cannot do it. Not on large scale projects.

That's it. > I have never copy and pasted code into development from an LLM/AI helper Well that's simply a different reality from what my employer is encouraging. So not relevant. They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff.

If I was 0 yoe or 20 yoe, those would be relevant too. And for what it's worth, I also started in middle school. >one leadership away from asking their employees the same thing your employer is Yeah that's probably true reply",

The market is upended right now with no end in sight. Also, most employers if not meaningfully all, will or are involving AI. Many, if not most, people applying for decent positions right now have 3x the experience and are very willing to do whatever. Don't let your principles end you up sleeping in your car. >  LLM's are designed to make things that \"look\" like human output and thus are very good at hiding bugs. This can be true, definitely was more often true in the past. But there is a time and a place for human expression, and probably isn't in code. Your human expression is likely helped by tools. I doubt you're writing in Notepad, but your IDE doesn't get thrown out the window because it can't fully replace you or write code for you. IF you are being blindly told to copy/paste from an LLM, then use that as part of your ideation and work from there, using AI tools as much as you can in ways that work. Become a leader in this new frontier by delving in (just kidding, that's meta about another article trending on AI) >  They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff. Your post needs more detail if you want people to reply to your exact situation, but I think you can make clear arguments against doing this, then do this for 3 weeks, followed by the obvious: backtracking. Leaders are by nature often encouraged to try new things. Standing in their way won't help you, but you can warn them, do it, then help them get back on track. By being a team member in this way, you are not in charge, but you can build trust equity if these leaders stick around and have techy ideas in future. In my experience, I usually outlast bad leadership (and their associated ideas). You have to be correct and not act like you're the boss to survive it, though! reply",

And simultaneously start looking for another job because you clearly don’t like them and disagree with their strategy in important ways.

Maybe worth thinking about how to get that voice heard without ruffling feathers. Try an evaporating cloud! This is a bit heavy to read but is a good technique to think about. It is so good it might change YOUR mind too about this situation!

          "text": "This is exactly how bug bounty hunters are being exploited for. Though it is on the good side about disclosure, calculate how much financial, reputation impact, negative publicity would cost the company and settle for a fair price and not a measly sum of 1k EUR. It is a huge red flag to keep it under the radar if they think the impact is going to be high. I'm sure it is high and that's the reason they want to keep it undisclosed while they silently patch it. One question: Was the discovery part of a bug bounty program? Or you stumbled upon it without any actual request? I'm trying to see the legal angle that might get down played there if you do not have the authorization to look at it. Being ethical is the only advantage I see if that is the case. Else, you should negotiate and demand a fair price and go for a public disclosure which will cause more harm than good for them. Everything has a price. Nothing in this world is free. Contact some good lawyer. Don't ever sign an NDA without vetting it out with a good lawyer. Fine prints matter a lot. As some of the fellow HNs mentioned, they will probably be looking at a huge impact and the reason for the NDA and a low sum as a token appreciation. They think they can buy their way being a corporate, any my advice would be to talk to some lawyers or contact a non-profit to help sort things out. Probably you could donate a % to them if you get a good amount. Hope you get what you deserve. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply — really appreciate it. I actually stumbled upon the vulnerability without any prior request. They don’t have an active bug bounty program, and the Head of IT Security I’m in touch with mentioned they don’t have dedicated funds for security researchers — which is hard to believe for a company with a £200M+ market cap. I’ll definitely dig a bit deeper into the legal side. Based on all the suggestions here, I’m leaning toward quoting them a fair amount considering the impact. If they don’t agree, I’ll likely reject the NDA and do a public write-up after a reasonable disclosure window. One thing I forgot to mention earlier as of today — the vulnerability is fixed (I reported it around 3 weeks ago), not sure if that changes anything leverage wise. reply",

          "text": "1k sounds like a discretionary amount that would quite neatly fit within a manager's budget for external consultants and so on, which is probably what they'll say you are when accounting for it. They're trying to fly under the radar, and have likely kept this knowledge to only a few people. The organisation will never change their ways unless they get bad publicity or have to spend so much money that their c-suite gets involved. I would be wary of trying to negotiate the payment upwards in case you are accused of extortion; just explain you'll disclose publicly in 30 days, which is more than enough time to fix what I assume is a web app backend bug. You don't want them dealing with this kind of issue as a feature to be implemented when there's space in one of the future sprints. They may try at this point to negotiate the payment upwards, which is a matter for you and your conscience, but I would say that if you don't get something close to 100k, it's likely to be swept under the rug internally and they'll never learn from their mistakes. reply",

You hacked a site (probably not legal).You reach out and reported it (nice gesture). They fixed it (the site is more secure (yay!). They offered to pay you $1k pounds (awesome!). You are rejecting the offer based on lies you tell yourself (they can pay more and if rather share it with the world be cause good things will happen for me if I do). Bad things can happen too. They can reach out to authorities. Your current or future employer could reach your future post and decide you aren't the right person for them. The underlying company could respond to your post and confirm you weren't authorized to test and a good portion of the security community would never seriously consider you for employment. Sure, you might be able to negotiate a little more, if you take the right approach. How much do you want? 1200, 10,000, 50,000? When you do something wrong, even with good intentions, and now you aren't happy with the amount they graciously offered to compensate you with, your approach to publicly expose them if you don't get what you want because \"they can pay more\" seems less like they won't pay for my expertise and more like extortion.

His core work hasn’t changed much, but he has generated a lot of AI driven unit tests that mock so much that they’re worse than no unit tests. I approached him about this and he kinda shrugged - said it was good test coverage went up. He’s much more attracted to building new things than making things well, which I think is the source of the issue. 2. We have a low performing dev who has spit out not great code (I think a result of being unable to evaluate what code is good) at a much higher rate. The PR reviews are a massive increase in time wasted. Both of these devs have personally stated AI has made them much more productive. It’s greatly tempered how I view AI productivity claims I see online. Personally I use it everyday and am willing to pay for it, but I’ve seen limited uses where it’s 10x (translations, areas I’m a novice). reply",

It means back then if you were making $1k/week in Jan 1, 2024, you'd expect to make $33k/week a year later. But thanks to AI, the standard is closer to $142k/week. Back then, it was normal to raise $75k or so to build a prototype, now you can build a prototype in a couple of weekends. Back then, you would polish your pitch to get VC funding. Now you build, get the customers, then show what the customers are buying and why, and ask for funding to get 1000x the number of customers. A lot of the risk factors have been removed. Building a legacy app no longer take multiple sync calls and weeks, they can be resolved in hours and maybe one sync call. Yes, I have a story of AI migrating a whole DB table when I asked it to move a button to another page. But it gets the tables right about 7 out of 10 times if you give it the right instructions. I dislike ORMs; they're practically a code smell. And AI works around that layer. reply",

          "text": "We've been building voice AI for 8 years, so I've watched this from both sides - first building AI products, now using AI tools to build faster. Honestly, the productivity gains feel like a mirage sometimes. Yes, I can prototype features in days instead of weeks now. But getting those prototypes to production quality? Still takes the same amount of time. Real-time voice processing can't have the hallucinations or edge case failures that AI-generated code often has. The weirdest part is how expectations shifted. When I delivered a feature in 2 weeks before, that was good. Now if I use AI and deliver in 1 week, suddenly 1 week becomes the new baseline for everything. You're not getting ahead - you're just keeping up with inflated expectations. I've seen the real AI profits go to people who can build complete products solo, not just code faster at their day job. A few engineers I know left big tech to build AI-powered micro-SaaS. They're making $50K/month instead of waiting years for senior staff promotions that might bump them $20K. But here's the catch - if starting an AI product is 10x easier, so is your competition. We're seeing way more AI startups, but the success rate is about the same. The bottleneck was never \"can you build it fast enough\" - it was always \"do people actually want this.\" reply",

Why would higher worker productivity translate to higher compensation? Owners don’t part from their extra profits unless pressured to do so.  Higher productivity does not produce higher wages. This is the productivity-pay gap, in place since 1980 as real wages have barely budged while productivity has continued to skyrocket, the value from the accruing to a small wealthy minority. Besides causing  social ills such as the concomitant \n de-democratization of society we are witnessing around us as a direct result of this, the productivity pay gap also undermines the fundamental fallacy of the AI hype crowd - higher productivity doesn’t translate into broader benefits for society, only for the business owning class. Only external pressure can force business owners to part with gains from rising productivity. With the productivity-pay gap of the last 55 years wealth is so concentrated that the government today is entirely captured by business owners. Billionaires wave their hands and select government officials, unmake the constitution, and form new political parties.  Can our government be relied on to pressure business owners into parting with their growing profits and raise wages? Our government has failed to do this for 55 years. If engineers want higher wages for their increased productivity - which has multiplied since 1980 with little of that going to workers - then we will have to pressure business owners ourselves.

Not sure that it works like that with the AI tools. It could also work if programmers started leaving jobs to do their own thing. Programmers need to get scarce to bump up salaries. As for companies, their profits are also linked to competition. If they have equally good competitors, then extra productivity is likely to lead to lower prices to keep attracting customers. The customers profit. If they are more unique, then the extra productivity can lead to higher profits as they shrink their costs (fewer programmers, earlier deliverables, better customization to what customers want). All of these forces take time to shake out. The most likely path is to enable a million independent projects to flourish and to find unserved niches that lead to a good, but not exorbitant, income, at least for a time. reply",

          "text": "\"If the productivity gains are so huge, shouldn’t we see those engineers getting promoted super fast or getting rich from building a product extremely fast?\" This is an entirely different question in itself, and isn't really related to AI, but more between productivity and corporations. Corporations are a pipeline. You have a certain amount of input and a certain amount of output. There is a queue of input stuff. If that queue runs dry, then you have wasted productivity. The pipe manager is being negligent somewhere - either we can cut down on costs by removing the cogs in the machine, or someone further up the pipe isn't producing enough output to satisfy the inputs. If FE has too much free time, then your options are: 1) pull FE into BE, 2) pull work from BE to FE, 3) get FE to do product stuff like A/B testing or talking to customers, 4) make more FE teams or even have one person in two teams, 5) turn the site into an app or the app into a site, 6) slow them down by making them return to office, 7) fire someone A Chinese company might have a couple dudes dedicated to answering all questions on APIs and the systems. A Western company will simply not document things or overdocument it to the point that it's too obtuse to read and yet doesn't answer the question. The worst cases I've seen is developing a whole new programming language, which becomes a white elephant maintained by interns. But the point is, there's mechanisms that kick in and slow down productivity so nobody needs to be laid off. There's also additional mechanisms like engineers being sick of working in 3 teams at once with no documentation, and so they leave. reply",

We settled on two practices that really helped: Append-only logs\n    Instead of chat threads that scroll away, we keep a single plain-text “journal” per project. Every update gets appended with a timestamp and author tag. No editing, no missed messages—people just read from the top and see everything in context.\n\n    Per-task semantic headers\n    We prefix each log entry with a short header like TASK-123: or MEETING-UX: so you can grep for specific topics later. It’s saved us hours hunting through free-form notes. (For anyone curious, I recently wrapped this into a tiny “TXT OS” proof-of-concept that lives in a single .txt file—happy to share if it’s of interest.) Hope that helps!

If you finish your calls late in the evening, especially the ones where you are the one doing the talking and presenting things, it's very hard to go to sleep straight after that. You need to add at least 1h of winding down time. As for motivation, from my experience, when I'm working on something I really like, I'm 10x more efficient that I would be in the office. When you start in the morning, you know that for a long period there will be nobody to interrupt you and you get a LOT more done. The opposite is similar though - when I'm not motivated by a project, it's insanely hard to motivate myself. But maybe it's a sign that the project shouldn't be done in the first place. reply",

          "text": "Most people don't like working 9-5. My sweet spot is 4 AM. Half the people I work with prefer nights - it's cooler, better time to smoke, etc. Maybe it's just SE Asia where people get lazy during the day. Or maybe we just have a culture of hanging out at night. 9-5 takes priority but teams tend to follow the devs. The main issue is always the regular meetings, the standups. Most people prefer to wake up at 10. Some at 11 lol. So you can move standups around \"lunch\" safely enough. Some people hate standups at the end of the day (i.e. me) because it tends to overlap with the inconsistent end of day school schedules and traffic jams. But do consider if you actually need standups. Everything should be on Jira. Whenever you commit a file, it can be on Jira too. Scrum was invented before all these tools, back when people had individual offices. Continuous Flow is a valid option and agile. Other key meetings are what to do (grooming), what have we done (demo), and what can we do better (retro). You don't actually need to follow any sprint format. A clean format is meetings on Monday and Friday, but with new teams and startups, you might want one every 2 days. If you can do async, do so. Lots of people prefer text too. Text is slower, mainly an issue for managers who need to talk to lots of people. But it lets people think more clearly and supply links as necessary. reply",

Some days I just don't work, and I learned to give myself the day (rarely two) but get back to work with a strong day the following day to regain my momentum. I find momentum is key in working remotely, you have to maintain a steady pace and not go too hard or too easy or else you're going to burn out or develop bad habits. I tend to work whatever days are necessary, weekend or whatever. My life is very flexible, so sometimes I'll have a mid-week weekend and work the weekend instead. tl;dr: momentum is key, try and work at least a few hours a day and ensure you maintain a steady pace over time without doing death-marches or being lazy. reply",

Something I've learned with eating + time zones is \"find out when people actually eat, not what time you'd be eating if your clock was changed too\". Apart from cultural differences you easily conclude lunch is \"sometime between 11:00 and 2:00\" just by surveying ones neighbors. Add in a few hour time difference and suddenly it's impossible to schedule a meeting unless you guess, learn, or see it on their calendar when scheduling. reply",

Easily top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates -- other startups will tell you this as well. The problem is when the job (or work-trial in our case) actually starts, it's just excuses upon excuses as to why he's missing a meeting, or why the PR was pushed late. The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

They don't own the transport and the burden of owning, and maintaining the transport is pushed on to freelancers, who have less certainty of income than they would as employees might. Theres been lots written about the insecurity to employment that is created by more things offering gig jobs on one hand but not always ending up also offering part time or full time positions. From the customers side, apps like Uber provide a sense of certainty (visual map) that existing industries haven't been willing to invest the same kind of capital into and those apps as a result are not comparable or inviting. reply",

Take it for the single point of data that it is, but: I have met equally as many high performers who do NOT code at home as I have mediocre ones that did. And the number of programmers who code solely on the job is far, far more common than those who take their work home with them. Statistically speaking, at least in my personal experience, that makes the at-home coder notably worse on average. As someone that used to think like you, I think the only thing you're really doing is the boys-club-esque equivalent of what the old Ivy League managers used to do (Oh, he's from MIT! That's perfect, we only hire MIT grads here). You're hiring what you know because you understand people with that background more. You might find on the opposite end of the spectrum that someone with a perfectly equal skillset is laughing at the idea of taking on personal projects when he can just optimize for getting hired somewhere where they prioritize paying you to learn on the job. reply",

People who regularly don't show up for work are by definition not \"top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates\" - in fact quite the opposite. That'll get you fired from PetSmart, let alone some bullshit $250k/yr software job. I think startups' freewheeling management and hiring practices need examined because this would be caught by the most basic of background or reference checks at any traditional business.

There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.  That's relevant to the discussion at hand because, at least in California, you could work from home for two companies with unrelated businesses and not break any rules. reply",

Technically there is always a contract between any two parties who are cooperating; it doesn’t have to be formalized in any particular way as long as the cooperating parties have a common understanding of the terms and agree on them. Many companies that don’t use formal contracts instead put all the information that is common to all employees into an employee handbook, and the details that are unique to a specific employee into the offer letter. The offer letter given to a new hire has details such as their starting salary and start date, and once they arrive they are given a copy of the handbook and often time to read it and discuss it with a manager. The handbook will explain in detail how promotions happen, the work expected from for various job titles, any rules the employees are expected to follow, etc, etc. Together these form the common understanding that underlies the contract, even if there is never a formal contract signed by both the employer and the employee. Contractors, on the other hand, always have a formal contract. Often a contractor spends a significant amount of their time negotiating these contracts, especially the scope of work.

You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

Prior to this current generation of web applications, we had the advent of concepts like Object Orientated Programming and prior to that even C was a massive move up from Assembly and punch cards. AI has written a lot of code. AI has written very little high velocity production code by itself (ie. for people with no coding background). In Ruby on Rails, the concept of fast coding has been around for over 20 years, look up this concept of Scaffolding: https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/ So to answer your question, 1. AI has pushed a lot of code\n2. AI has pushed almost no code without the oversight of human software engineers\n3. Software engineers are pushing a magnitude more code and producing more functional utility and solving more bugs than ever before I don't know what the future holds, but I do think that this is not a new trend to use software to help humans build faster, and I don't think software has the ability to fully replace humans (yet). reply",

Roll to disbelieve on this one. There's no way that creating something like WordPress 20 years ago, before any modern-day web application frameworks, was anywhere near as easy. I'm not even talking React/Next or whatever - this was before RoR, before Django (or at least very early versions of both). I think it's pretty impossible to look around and not notice that technical advances have improved a lot of things in the world - why does it sound credible that programming itself hasn't improved at all in twenty years? Even look at languages like C++ today compared to 20 years ago, they're massively different - do you think all those changes to the languages are neutral or negative in terms of productivity? reply",

I just didn't think we were talking about that aspect, just how long it takes to actually build the code of WordPress. You might be saying that making the technical-building aspects of most technical products go faster won't necessarily have as big an impact as many programmers believe. Programming isn't the core of most products to the degree most programmers think, and instead the core of most products/companies is more about product thinking, sales & marketing, etc. I agree with this sentiment a lot. That aside, I think there's no question it's faster to program in Python or C++ right now, than it was 20 years ago.

There is a big difference between AI autonomously writing code and developers just finding it easier to prompt changes rather than typing them manually. In one case, you have an automated software engineer, and may be able to reduce your headcount. In the other, developers may just be slightly more productive or even just enjoy writing code using AI more, but the coding is still very much driven by the developers themselves.

So let's take it on face value and say 95% is written by AI. When you free one bottleneck you expose the next. You still need developers to review it to make sure it's doing the right thing. You still need developers to be able to translate the business context into instructions that make the right product. You have to engage with the product. You need to architect the system - the context windows mean that the tasks can't just be handed off to AI.

Nowadays, this is not the case any more as people order replacement parts for whatever metal piece that broke in your car, house, etc. The metal molding happens in factories instead. But in order you still need to have people who know how to mold metals. The early folks for this profession were blacksmiths. Nowadays you would not call them any more. But it's definitely been \"engineers with AI\". Same goes for industrialized food. The huge industrial bakeries still employ people who know how to bake bread, but they can do 1000x more than they could do if they had to knead the dough on their own, separate it, form little pieces of bread, order it nicely on a tray, etc. Now it's a machine doing most pieces of work, but they still have folks who design new bread products, adjust machines, know what to change in the formula if one particular product from one particular supplier is not available in the quantities needed, etc. A lot of the skills needed aligns enough with the traditional job of a baker that these factories employ actual bakers. As for software, whenever I use AI tools, I don't really feel that they help me save time much. But it's entirely possible that this is going to change in the future. They are only going to get better. And of course a lot of people say it's useful for them, so it already affects folks. Just because something is not useful to me doesn't mean it's not going to be useful to anybody. reply",

          "text": "I don't work for OpenAI and I doubt some random employee is going to come here and share what is likely a secret. I'm in the industry though so I have some idea of what's going on these days, both where I work and more broadly. AI is getting better at writing code. However writing code is just some fraction of the work of many software engineers. AI doesn't work independently, it needs to be guided, its work needs to be reviewed, tested etc. There are some domains where it does better and some domains where it doesn't. There's a range of \"AI\" work between auto-complete style work, assisting in understanding a code base, and writing code from some spec or doing other types work. All in all I would say it's a decent improvement to productivity for many situations. It's really hard to say how much and it's also not a zero sum game, as productivity improves there's more work. Something to keep in mind is that if you look at a modern software project likely most of the code executing is not code written by the developers of that project. There's a huge stack of open source bits executing for almost any new project. Specifically in OpenAI you also need to consider what type of software they are likely writing. Some of it may be more or less \"vanilla\" code and other is likely very specialized/performance critical. The vanilla code like API wrappers or simple front end pieces is likely more amenable to be written by AI whereas the more cutting edge algorithmic/scheduling/optimization work is almost certainly not done by AI. At least yet. As software organizations become larger there's a lot of overhead and waste. It is possible that AI can enable smaller teams and that has a multiplicative effect because it lets you reduce that waste/overhead. There are likely also software engineers who will become better/adapt to new workflows and some who will not. It's really hard to say where things are going but overall my sense is that this like many other innovations will lead to more software and more jobs and not the other way around. There are many moving pieces here, not just AI itself but geopolitics, macro-economics, etc. Where are those new jobs going to get created, what new types of software/technology are going to be created etc. etc. History seems to show us that we'll adapt/evolve and grow. reply",

          "text": "I absolutely believe that a large proportion of new code written is at least in-part AI generated, but that doesn't mean a large proportion of new code is 100% soup-to-nuts/pull-request-to-merge the result of decisions made by an agent and not a human. I doubt that very much. I think the difference between situations where AI-driven development works and doesn't is going to be largely down to the quality of the engineers who are supervising and prompting to generate that code, and the degree to which they manually evaluate it before moving it forward. I think you'll find that good engineers who understand what they're telling an agent to do are still extremely valuable, and are unlikely to go anywhere in the short to mid term. AI tools are not yet at the point where they are reliable on their own, even for systems they helped build, and it's unclear whether they will be any time soon purely through model scaling (though it's possible). I think you can see the realities of AI tooling in the fact that the major AI companies are hiring lots and lots of engineers, not just for AI-related positions, but for all sorts of general engineering positions. For example, here's a post for a backend engineer at OpenAI: https://openai.com/careers/backend-software-engineer-leverag... - and one from Anthropic: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4561280008 . Note that neither of these require direct experience with using AI coding agents, just an interest in the topic! Contrast that with many companies who now demand engineers explain how they are using AI-driven workflows. When they are being serious about getting people to do the work that will make them money, rather than engaging in marketing hype, AI companies are honest: AI agents are tools, just like IDEs, version control systems, etc. It's up to the wise engineer to use them in a valuable way. Is it possible they're just hiring these folks to try and make their models better to later replace those people? It's possible. But I'm not sure when in time, if ever, they'll reach the point where that was viable. reply",

I've had good experiences with the GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code for working with Rust, specifically with Sonnet 4. Refactoring duplicate code into a helper function should be achievable with current agents. To replace existing code with an external crate , you could try giving the agent access to a browser (e.g. playwright-mcp), and instructing it to browse the crate docs. For anything that involves using APIs that may be past the knowledge cutoff for the agent's model, it's definitely worthwhile to have some MCP tools on hand that'll let it browse for up-to-date info - the brave-search and context7 MCPs are good. reply",

For example: I use Claude Code to explore options before I commit to a design. I’ll ask it “what are 3 ways to abstract this logic?” and sometimes that alone gives me a better direction. It’s pretty good at turning rough notes or comments into starter code or test cases. That saves time on boilerplate.

While I'm unsure whether it still ends up being quicker, that's really immaterial for me because it absolutely kills the enjoyment of the work. reply",

I’ve followed the commonly touted “plan, act, evaluate” approach; I’ve got it to generate a clear project vision, scope, and feature checklist. Then told it to refer to that for context. I’ve been descriptive and explicit in my prompting, way more so than previously. It has gotten the broad strokes right, I’ve got an exceptionally barebones DSL, made up of 5 entities, working…just. It has now started to spin its wheels on small issues and can’t fix them without breaking something else. The codebase isn’t even big (~8 main functions across a few files). Troubleshooting the code is difficult because it’s convoluted and I lack the same intuition for it I would have had I written it myself. I’ve decided to rewrite everything with less control ceded to the LLM. When it works, it feels great. When it doesn’t, which is often, the spell is broken and I feel I’ve wasted a bunch of time and have not much to show for it. reply",

Which kind of makes sense if we view Claude Code as a junior engineer with infinite stamina. I also actually like to spin up Claude Code and Gemini in parallel to see what each one comes up with. Gemini will often do the simpler approach, but not often fully featured, and my solution often ends up taking the 2 solutions and refining in Cursor to come up with the final solution. reply",

Here’s what I’ve seen help in getting those crucial first 10 customers: Be brutally specific about who you're helping: Which ones, where, with what exact pain, and why now. This is your ICP. Write your Dream 10 list (real names, real companies). These are your early believers. Go deep into their problems and show up where they already are. Your unfair advantage right now is your founder network, your story and your industry experience. This is where the “why you” matters most. And honestly, every B2B founder needs to be able to pull in 10 clients from their own network off the bat. Early traction comes from being focused, obsessed and specific. You need to be honest with yourself and get those first three things down before you build or go make lists with Apollo. reply",

We'd reach out to companies in target industries and offer to analyze their customer service call data for free, then show them what voice AI could do with their actual data. It felt like being taken advantage of sometimes, honestly. We'd spend weeks building custom demos and proof-of-concepts without any guaranteed return. But when you don't have a network in the industry, you have to do that kind of work to prove your credibility. The breakthrough was realizing we weren't just giving away free work - we were learning what these companies actually needed vs what we thought they needed. Those free consulting projects taught us more about product-market fit than any survey could have. By the time we had 10 real paying customers, we'd probably done free work for 30+ companies. The key was setting boundaries about when to transition from free to paid. You have to judge that timing yourself based on the relationship and how much value you're providing. reply",

          "text": "My experience:  I've had a service called HRM.monster, the domain is up for renewal on the 19th of this month, and am thinking on letting it lapse, for a name change - it is off a product called HRMgo, I have had 0 users since the purchase a year ago, and spent $750 for it from a Flippa ad thinking I hit the money spot.  Eventually ended up finding out that the software was $69 package download and not custom built, as the main website led me to believe.  I tried to build relationships with various people to gain their trust in providing services to them for a bridge to their clientele (not compete, but add additional support services), a win win with the company and their clientele.  No one wanted to talk with me.  I heard comments later-on that said I wasn't made for being in the business.  It's brutal. While my experience may be different than yours, there are other factors at play in with God having something todo with it.  There is no greater thing than word of mouth, and the house is the answer. I been trying for over a year and too chose to use email as letting clients know I existed, I didn't get anything in return. I would try talking to influencers who you think would benefit by a simple DM or email; you might want to look into LinkedIn's higher tiered contact searching for better contact specific to your demographic, and services such as audience lab if you have the ability of spending $500/mo you can get a few contact lists that have an excess of 300k+ lines of info w/ various other relevant data that you could also sell additional services to. There's also building relationships through advertising on Facebook, Google, etc., there's also vibe.co, and caasie.co... budget minded services for getting your name and caasie allows targeting specific towards your industry through video ads... where as vibe puts you on billboards. While I don't have all the answers, having something different than the crowd is also a sell, like creating a service and building that need that answers a problem you deal with at work problem; something that you could turn into a serivce, and that also is viable for other people en masse. It is really an inundation of services out there as you've stated.  The early ones caught on, had fewer people contacting them. The ones with financial backing win, because of the marketing factor, and the NEED building for the product.  The best thing is to think of a project that women need, as they're the hard core consumer.  I can't think of buying myself anything except food in the last 10 years, the occasional new pair of shoes, and slacks/shirt.  I've used the same computer for the last 10 years, and its virtually my life rn... It's best to join a chamber and sell your services to on what you can do vs your product, you sound pretty sound in the AI generated apps, so you've got that going for you, just need ideas, keep building until someone finds a need for your services, you could essentially steal someones idea, unless you end up getting requested to sign an NDA with said person if you went through the chamber. Sounds like you got a people problem though ;-) reply",

          "text": "Even during great hiring times, the roles you're seeking are often slow to hire and sometimes don't get filled even when there are qualified applicants. There has to be a hand-in-glove fit to the team for these roles to be effective, which means interviews often get delayed because someone key can't be there... then later, another key person is out, and the cycle turns into a crisis and finally interviews happen and the role gets filled. But, as you know, AI has seriously cut into your niche and hiring has been very minimal for over a year in data-related roles. Non-data people can do so much more with the help of an AI that can read CSV output from common data sources that I'm seeing people get more benefit from directly being able to work with the sources themselves and ask questions rather than get a report made from the BI team. I would consider widening your search into other domains, adding AI to your workflow and make it front-and-center. I clicked on your LinkedIn profile and you are wearing the most casual outfit I have ever seen on a LinkedIn profile, so I would consider finding or taking a photograph that looks like a typical job seeker. I would then remove any recent activity from my profile: without logging in, your first post is about difficulties you are facing and the third is a \"hot take\" that some companies would not appreciate. I'd cut all personal information that wouldn't get me hired. Lastly, I'd make a more memorable and higher resolution main graphic. Right now, if this is an example of the quality of your work output, it is very blurry on my 15\" laptop and doesn't give a great impression in that regard. None of this is a complaint or attack - I heard your desire for input and am sharing my feedback as a person who has been in hiring roles for 2 decades. reply",

OTOH I did get a sales gig a while back and I do look good in my profile. So I’m not advocating bad photos. You should simply look like someone everyone would like to work with and get along. I used a bright city-vacation photo in which I look happy because I really am happy.

Like, it’s clear to me that someone on an executive/salesy biz dev brand will probably present best with a professional studio headshot in a suit. That’s the look. But then someone who is being hired to say, code, that same choice may give off the wrong vibe. Reason why I’m pointing it out is that on LI folks will over-compensate. You’ll see kids presenting themselves with magazine cover headshots that sort of thing. So yeah, conformity matters - but it’s very context specific and nuanced. It’s worth asking the question who is looking at this and what should they think at first glance? What are the values? reply",

I’ve been working professionally since 1996 across 10 jobs from everything from startups, to boring enterprise jobs to BigTech and full time for consulting companies.  My last three jobs have been remote as have been the interviews.  No one had the slightest clue about my having CP since going remote. Why do you think it’s your CP and not just the market sucking for everyone right now? Why do you have that you are “physically disabled” on you LinkedIn profile? Don’t do that . You are giving people a reason to discriminate \nagainst you unlawfully. Second point:  if you are just blindly submitting your resume to job sites/ATS’s you have already lost.  I’m very credentialed in my field and I heard crickets from fire bombing my resume in 2023 and last year when I was looking for a job back to back.  But that was my plan C while I was going through the interview processes  based on my network and a targeted outreach where I had the  exact set of skills and specialized experience that were looking for and responding to inbound recruiters.

Two things stand out from my experience: (1) my company isn't hiring, while the DS team is doing fine revenue wise, the rest of the company is doing poorly; so uncommunicated moratorium on hiring; (2) I interviewed at an AI company that I'm currently subcontracting under - and they like me - and I didn't get past the first round because their requirements are so high right now (aka I did mediocrely on one interview and that was enough to tank me). All this is to say, GenAI is booming but there's competing factors going on for businesses to hire. Also a different take, look for contract jobs. As with (1) above, my company isn't hiring FT but they're open to contractors. I wish you luck. reply",

          "text": "> it's just super competitive so companies have so many options on who to hire Yes, it is this and not likely related to your abilities or disabilities so much as the natural flow and quality of the interview. Having interviewed a lot of people, some candidates really make an awesome impression and stand out. If we don't have one of those stand-out, hire-them-now candidates, we don't hire. So I would work on being the person they can't wait to send an offer to -- in addition to skillset, this most often comes down to charm, a sense of \"getting it\" or clicking with the overall role/company, reading the room, and excellent natural back-and-forth, which is super hard over video calls. The key here is numbers. In a tough market, you probably need 10 interviews to get hired. Figure out what got you those first few interviews and lean in and make many more happen. You'll find the people you click with and your experience of going to multiple interviews will give you great practice in the meantime. reply",

If Usain Bolt had to run a race using his fingers, he would have to get used to being in second place behind me ( and smile showing it's okay to laugh )\" You mentioned you use a walker, would a wheelchair (just for in-person interviews) be doable?  I think people are less likely to be negatively judged for using a wheelchair than a walker.  Seeing a younger person in a wheelchair is far more common than seeing a younger person use a walker.  Seeing something strange (uncommon) will be treated negatively subconsciously.  If you can locomote faster in a wheelchair, than people will subconsciously equate that with your ability to work faster, especially if you can roll faster than other people can walk. If you do the wheelchair thing, and you get a job working in-person, use the wheelchair for a week or two, but tell people a white-lie such as your doctor says you can transition to a walker in the next week or two, which will help strengthen your leg muscles.  Always spin stuff positively.  That way when your coworkers see you using a walker, they will be supportive and think positively to themselves rather than thinking how terrible that must be. (Just be sure to have a complete backstory ready to go for things like when people ask, how long have you been in a wheelchair.  Or maybe have a reason why the wheelchair was just temporary and you used a walker beforehand.) Hmmm... Would that be considered a \"hack\" good enough for Y Combinator's application?

          "text": "There was nothing anybody could do to offset the reversal once the IBM/Microsoft alliance resulted in removal of ROM Basic just when PC adoption was in the early skyrocketing stage. Up until that point the main paradigm was that one of the primary things you would purchase a \"personal\" computer for was to program it the way you wanted.  Unless you had only the most mainstream generic usage in mind, there was not published code nor commercial software to address your particular ambitions and everybody knew you would have to write your own programs. Programming was never expected to be accomplished by everybody , rather by anybody who wanted to, whenever they felt like it. So naturally you were supposed to always be able to buy a new computer, take it out of the box, put it on the desk and start programming.  No other monkey business or friction of any kind, you just plug it in and go.  Anything less would be stupid as shinola. Of course the majority of buyers were not as ready to program as their PC's were capable, it had always been like that and of course most people got the most use out of their machines without having to write any code themselves. But anybody anywhere was still supposed to be able to sit down at any decent computer, turn it on and start programming or continue a project any time they wanted to.  Long after the box had been thrown away and the warranty had expired.  Just knowing how powerful the emerging machines were getting was pretty good incentive to purchase based on expectations, even when most buyers had no programming background at all they knew that was the only way to make the PC do what they really wanted.  But the widespread attitude was that once the PC was purchased, they were already so far ahead of the curve just learning how to use it for the simple stuff, it was fine for self-programming to stay on the back burner until it can be experimented with.  Nobody thought writing useful programs was going to be \"easy\", or that just anybody would be very effective, so it made sense to approach it seriously when the time would be right and you needed it most. Well before that attitude could be allowed to continue, the rug was pulled, making sure that no PC ever again will be like a Commodore where they are all ready-to-program right out-of-the-box using the same basic language & interface across-the-board.  Who would or would not benefit the most if all PC's would have retained the inbuilt \"amateur\" programming language and inherent ability to frictionlessly share personal programs that came along with it? Line numbers would have been worth it to this day :\\ reply",

They always seem to take the form of \"Should we divide this group into A and B,  A stays here and B goes over there and that way everybody is happy\" Invariably the person who proposes this wants to remain in group A and will not be a participant in group B. To me this seems like the subtext is \"Those people are not welcome here,  they are not like us.   It's not like we have anything against them, we just don't want them ramming it down our throats\" Anyone is free to make a website with whatever content they want,  they can invite people to it and grow your own community.    Directing a community to divide to remove an element you dislike is an attempt to appropriate the established community. reply",

Every day it was the same discussion over again, from someone who didn't bother to do a Google search or look at what was posted the day prior. After a week or so of seeing the same discussion over and over again, I stopped reading the news site. Needless to say, it's important to occasionally have discussions like this. I also think we under-appreciate the amount of moderation that goes on here. Sometimes I look at the \"new\" feed and it is just loaded with lots and lots of nonsense, so I get that someone has to put their finger on the scale to keep the quality up. reply",

In the specific case of AI it's way worse than the usual suspects where everyone is effected and so everyone has to have some opinion (looking at you politics). Because even some rant about how much you hate AI is directly feeding it at least 3 ways: first there's the raw data, then there's the free-QA aspect, then there's the free-advertisement aspect when others speak up to disagree with your rant.

After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

Most people just buy/flip crypto or hold BTC that they'll sell when they double it after a year. AI in LLM form is at least useful in many ways and in front of millions of people without any rugpulls and other shit, but due to their inherent limitations (doesn't matter how much python it writes and executes, half the time or more its wrong for any actual/meaningful work) I think the hype will settle in the next couple of years. reply",

Since then, they've increased to: - \"show hn\" \"llm\" – 2,417 (+54) - \"show hn\" \"ai\" – 13,376 (+248) - \"show hn\" \"vibe coded\" – 23 (past month) That’s about 6 LLM-related and 27 AI-related posts per day, just in the \"show hn\" category. When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a non-negligible amount of astroturfing going on across HN.

It is weak because this tool is strongly coupled to the problem: filtering HN. It's an example of the more general problem of people wanting to control what they see. This has existed at least since the classic usenet \"killfiles\", but is an area that, I believe, has been ripe for a comprehensive local solution for some time. OTOH, narrow solutions validate the broader solution, especially if there are a lot of them. Although in that case you invite a ton of \"momentum\" issues with ingrained user bases (and heated advocacy), hopelessly incompatible data models and/or UX models, and so on. It's an interesting world (in the Chinese curse sense) where such tools can be trivially created.

If you're not going to do that, then since we are hackers here and we solve things by building tools, building a tool that filters out the stuff you don't want to see is trivial . So trivial I could get o3 to solve it for me in literally minutes. (This is a pointed knock at the \"AI isn't even useful crowd\", just in case any of them are still holding out.) There's a solid meta-joke here too, which is that filtering on keywords is a bad way to solve this problem. The better way to solve this profile... is to use AI! So yeah, I'm not embarrassed at all.

For useful tools I basically wait until something starts appearing in multiple places like HN comments, YouTube tech videos/comments, or on Reddit. This is what led to me hearing about Claude Code and trying it out before convincing other engineers at my company to try it. Now we're considering it over Cursor not so much because of Cursor pricing change but just because Claude Code is doing so much better. That then leads me to an even more specific topic which is how I stay on top of info about the tools I'm using and for that I tend to stick to subreddits i.e. /r/ClaudeAI Some YouTube sources would be any of the \"tech-influencers\" like ThePrimeagen[0], Internet of Bugs[1], or dare I say Fireship[2] 0 - https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen 1 - https://www.youtube.com/@InternetOfBugs 2 - https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship reply",

O3 Pro is better at abstraction, but grok heavy is better at bug hunting, and only doing exactly as needed. I swapped my openai pro license for grok, its good. Another big advantage is the context window size. Honestly I use these models all day long, and have felt that while sonnet 3.5 was ground breaking, but that anthropic is behind google, openai, and now xai. For tools, I use repo prompt + grok website. Personally think claude code is overrated, and hand building the context by selecting the files is far better for complicated tasks reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer.

They also came with the problem that institutional knowledge was non-existent because they had a rotating crew of people working for you. Hiring someone in-house is more efficient and better for building institutional knowledge. The companies he applied for specifically did not want to contract the work out to a body shop. reply",

There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.

          "text": "It’s not really rare, plenty of companies in the US use employment contracts. But a majority don’t, not in the European sense. Technically there is always a contract between any two parties who are cooperating; it doesn’t have to be formalized in any particular way as long as the cooperating parties have a common understanding of the terms and agree on them. Many companies that don’t use formal contracts instead put all the information that is common to all employees into an employee handbook, and the details that are unique to a specific employee into the offer letter. The offer letter given to a new hire has details such as their starting salary and start date, and once they arrive they are given a copy of the handbook and often time to read it and discuss it with a manager. The handbook will explain in detail how promotions happen, the work expected from for various job titles, any rules the employees are expected to follow, etc, etc. Together these form the common understanding that underlies the contract, even if there is never a formal contract signed by both the employer and the employee. Contractors, on the other hand, always have a formal contract. Often a contractor spends a significant amount of their time negotiating these contracts, especially the scope of work. I should know, I worked as a contractor for many years. reply",

But that's pretty much it. >  I think I would need to spend $2000+ to run a decent model locally Not really. Repurpose second hand parts and you can do it for 1/4 of that cost. It can also be a server and do other things when you aren't running models. reply",

In practice there's no right answer to this - I mean sad library for plants? Animals? Fungi? The question quickly becomes meaningless because without a lot more context there's no right answer. In the scope of language - is this for embedded programs? Desktops? Phones? Is it for system components? Is it going to talk to hardware? Or networks? Is it headless or heavy UI? What OS is it running on? Is it for writing CRUD apps? Or games? Will it be used in space? Every context brings different trade offs. Different boundaries, different resources, different everything. Thus every answer to your question is both true for some places, and false in others. Thus variety in context is what leads us to the current situation- lots of options. reply",

At 3 years, you’re probably leaving behind the part of your career where you learn to write good code at the function/class/small module level and entering the part where the learning is about design and architecture of larger systems and libraries. This is also the point where at many companies you’ll start to be expected to engage more with what the product is and the ultimate problems you’re solving for the user.

          "text": "I think this is the wrong question. The right question is how much human code can a human push now vs prior to AI. Everything we've done in coding has been assisted. Prior to this current generation of web applications, we had the advent of concepts like Object Orientated Programming and prior to that even C was a massive move up from Assembly and punch cards. AI has written a lot of code. AI has written very little high velocity production code by itself (ie. for people with no coding background). In Ruby on Rails, the concept of fast coding has been around for over 20 years, look up this concept of Scaffolding: https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/ So to answer your question, 1. AI has pushed a lot of code\n2. AI has pushed almost no code without the oversight of human software engineers\n3. Software engineers are pushing a magnitude more code and producing more functional utility and solving more bugs than ever before I don't know what the future holds, but I do think that this is not a new trend to use software to help humans build faster, and I don't think software has the ability to fully replace humans (yet). reply",

Roll to disbelieve on this one. There's no way that creating something like WordPress 20 years ago, before any modern-day web application frameworks, was anywhere near as easy. I'm not even talking React/Next or whatever - this was before RoR, before Django (or at least very early versions of both). I think it's pretty impossible to look around and not notice that technical advances have improved a lot of things in the world - why does it sound credible that programming itself hasn't improved at all in twenty years? Even look at languages like C++ today compared to 20 years ago, they're massively different - do you think all those changes to the languages are neutral or negative in terms of productivity? reply",

I just didn't think we were talking about that aspect, just how long it takes to actually build the code of WordPress. You might be saying that making the technical-building aspects of most technical products go faster won't necessarily have as big an impact as many programmers believe. Programming isn't the core of most products to the degree most programmers think, and instead the core of most products/companies is more about product thinking, sales & marketing, etc. I agree with this sentiment a lot. That aside, I think there's no question it's faster to program in Python or C++ right now, than it was 20 years ago.

There is a big difference between AI autonomously writing code and developers just finding it easier to prompt changes rather than typing them manually. In one case, you have an automated software engineer, and may be able to reduce your headcount. In the other, developers may just be slightly more productive or even just enjoy writing code using AI more, but the coding is still very much driven by the developers themselves.

You still need developers to be able to translate the business context into instructions that make the right product. You have to engage with the product. You need to architect the system - the context windows mean that the tasks can't just be handed off to AI.

          "text": "It could be true, the primary issue here is that it's the wrong metric. I mean you could write 100% of your code with AI if you were basically telling it exactly what to write... If we assume it isn't a lie, then given current AI capabilities we should assume that AI isn't being used in a maximally efficient way. However, developer efficiency isn't the only metric a company like Anthropic would care about, after all they're trying to build the best coding assistant with Claude Code. So for them understanding the failure cases, and the prompting need to recover from those failures is likely more important than just lines of code their developers are producing per hour. So my guess (assuming the claim is true) is that Anthropic are forcing their employees to use Claude Code to write as much code as possible to collect data on how to improve it. reply",

Nowadays, this is not the case any more as people order replacement parts for whatever metal piece that broke in your car, house, etc. The metal molding happens in factories instead. But in order you still need to have people who know how to mold metals. The early folks for this profession were blacksmiths. Nowadays you would not call them any more. But it's definitely been \"engineers with AI\". Same goes for industrialized food. The huge industrial bakeries still employ people who know how to bake bread, but they can do 1000x more than they could do if they had to knead the dough on their own, separate it, form little pieces of bread, order it nicely on a tray, etc. Now it's a machine doing most pieces of work, but they still have folks who design new bread products, adjust machines, know what to change in the formula if one particular product from one particular supplier is not available in the quantities needed, etc. A lot of the skills needed aligns enough with the traditional job of a baker that these factories employ actual bakers. As for software, whenever I use AI tools, I don't really feel that they help me save time much. But it's entirely possible that this is going to change in the future. They are only going to get better. And of course a lot of people say it's useful for them, so it already affects folks.

I'm in the industry though so I have some idea of what's going on these days, both where I work and more broadly. AI is getting better at writing code. However writing code is just some fraction of the work of many software engineers. AI doesn't work independently, it needs to be guided, its work needs to be reviewed, tested etc. There are some domains where it does better and some domains where it doesn't. There's a range of \"AI\" work between auto-complete style work, assisting in understanding a code base, and writing code from some spec or doing other types work. All in all I would say it's a decent improvement to productivity for many situations. It's really hard to say how much and it's also not a zero sum game, as productivity improves there's more work. Something to keep in mind is that if you look at a modern software project likely most of the code executing is not code written by the developers of that project. There's a huge stack of open source bits executing for almost any new project. Specifically in OpenAI you also need to consider what type of software they are likely writing. Some of it may be more or less \"vanilla\" code and other is likely very specialized/performance critical. The vanilla code like API wrappers or simple front end pieces is likely more amenable to be written by AI whereas the more cutting edge algorithmic/scheduling/optimization work is almost certainly not done by AI. At least yet. As software organizations become larger there's a lot of overhead and waste. It is possible that AI can enable smaller teams and that has a multiplicative effect because it lets you reduce that waste/overhead. There are likely also software engineers who will become better/adapt to new workflows and some who will not. It's really hard to say where things are going but overall my sense is that this like many other innovations will lead to more software and more jobs and not the other way around. There are many moving pieces here, not just AI itself but geopolitics, macro-economics, etc. Where are those new jobs going to get created, what new types of software/technology are going to be created etc. etc. History seems to show us that we'll adapt/evolve and grow. reply",

I think the difference between situations where AI-driven development works and doesn't is going to be largely down to the quality of the engineers who are supervising and prompting to generate that code, and the degree to which they manually evaluate it before moving it forward. I think you'll find that good engineers who understand what they're telling an agent to do are still extremely valuable, and are unlikely to go anywhere in the short to mid term. AI tools are not yet at the point where they are reliable on their own, even for systems they helped build, and it's unclear whether they will be any time soon purely through model scaling (though it's possible). I think you can see the realities of AI tooling in the fact that the major AI companies are hiring lots and lots of engineers, not just for AI-related positions, but for all sorts of general engineering positions. For example, here's a post for a backend engineer at OpenAI: https://openai.com/careers/backend-software-engineer-leverag... - and one from Anthropic: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4561280008 . Note that neither of these require direct experience with using AI coding agents, just an interest in the topic! Contrast that with many companies who now demand engineers explain how they are using AI-driven workflows. When they are being serious about getting people to do the work that will make them money, rather than engaging in marketing hype, AI companies are honest: AI agents are tools, just like IDEs, version control systems, etc. It's up to the wise engineer to use them in a valuable way. Is it possible they're just hiring these folks to try and make their models better to later replace those people? It's possible. But I'm not sure when in time, if ever, they'll reach the point where that was viable. reply",

For example: I use Claude Code to explore options before I commit to a design. I’ll ask it “what are 3 ways to abstract this logic?” and sometimes that alone gives me a better direction. It’s pretty good at turning rough notes or comments into starter code or test cases. That saves time on boilerplate.

Regardless, I'm still unsure how it can read these temperatures since the \"put in freezer for a while\" method seems to work when it does this and everything gets \"un-sluggish\" right away and starts working as well as if I restart it, no matter how many things are open. So it's like the processor \"works as if it wasn't overheating\", but for some reason the temperature readings for things like synching sometimes don't work because it reads the temp as approaching ~200º, and even external apps read it as such (though I realize they may just be repeating an internal OS error). reply",

Then you can get two for $1600, fit them in a full size case, 128GB DDR5 for $300, some Ryzen CPU like the 9900X and a mobo and case and PSU to fill up the rest of the budget. If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

          "text": "Do not track dev productivity. That is a concern of the engineering manager, not the PM. If a product manager needs analytics, dig into what they are trying to accomplish. Most of the time, they are trying to understand delivery velocity in order to plan roadmaps and communications, and do not truly care about productivity of individual devs. This is why Scrum got popular - not because it is good for the devs, but because it is predictable for the PMs. So you are on the right track of pulling info from your system. Continue to treat this as a consulting gig - work with them on metrics they can pull from your systems to give them the answers they really want. Depending on how easy they are to work with, and how open to change, suggest that they change their communication patterns, and do not promise timelines to stakeholders or customers. If they limit customer transparency to roadmaps and priorities, it is amazing how little they need to track from the devs. And in my experience, the increased autonomy that gives the dev team results in feaster delivery, anyway. reply",

Also I'd make sure to hold back the commits done in the WFO days and hammer them in on the WFH days.

After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

This for me has solved the issue of dividing community, which at the least from a practical level can be tricky. Ive been exploring how to achieve this effect \"on top\" of HN lately, rather than by controlling followers, by popping a very simple AI filter on top that re-ranks it for me, and found it quite satisfying, but not sure what the ultimate value/usecase might be. reply",

There were so many posts about how all the topics are about crypto and how it is annoying. Ultimately, all that noise and the billions of dollars poured into that turned into a meme if we're honest. Most people just buy/flip crypto or hold BTC that they'll sell when they double it after a year. AI in LLM form is at least useful in many ways and in front of millions of people without any rugpulls and other shit, but due to their inherent limitations (doesn't matter how much python it writes and executes, half the time or more its wrong for any actual/meaningful work) I think the hype will settle in the next couple of years. reply",

Since then, they've increased to: - \"show hn\" \"llm\" – 2,417 (+54) - \"show hn\" \"ai\" – 13,376 (+248) - \"show hn\" \"vibe coded\" – 23 (past month) That’s about 6 LLM-related and 27 AI-related posts per day, just in the \"show hn\" category. When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a non-negligible amount of astroturfing going on across HN.

If you're not going to do that, then since we are hackers here and we solve things by building tools, building a tool that filters out the stuff you don't want to see is trivial . So trivial I could get o3 to solve it for me in literally minutes. (This is a pointed knock at the \"AI isn't even useful crowd\", just in case any of them are still holding out.) There's a solid meta-joke here too, which is that filtering on keywords is a bad way to solve this problem. The better way to solve this profile... is to use AI! So yeah, I'm not embarrassed at all.

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop.

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this.",

That's perfect, we only hire MIT grads here). You're hiring what you know because you understand people with that background more.

Other states might be different, but stuff you do outside of work doesn't automatically become your employer's IP in California. There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.  That's relevant to the discussion at hand because, at least in California, you could work from home for two companies with unrelated businesses and not break any rules. reply",

          "text": "It’s not really rare, plenty of companies in the US use employment contracts. But a majority don’t, not in the European sense. Technically there is always a contract between any two parties who are cooperating; it doesn’t have to be formalized in any particular way as long as the cooperating parties have a common understanding of the terms and agree on them. Many companies that don’t use formal contracts instead put all the information that is common to all employees into an employee handbook, and the details that are unique to a specific employee into the offer letter. The offer letter given to a new hire has details such as their starting salary and start date, and once they arrive they are given a copy of the handbook and often time to read it and discuss it with a manager. The handbook will explain in detail how promotions happen, the work expected from for various job titles, any rules the employees are expected to follow, etc, etc. Together these form the common understanding that underlies the contract, even if there is never a formal contract signed by both the employer and the employee. Contractors, on the other hand, always have a formal contract. Often a contractor spends a significant amount of their time negotiating these contracts, especially the scope of work. I should know, I worked as a contractor for many years. reply",

At first it felt absurd & silly, but over time, the spirit of it grew on me a lot & has stuck with me. Let the backlog grow! But have tools to see what actually matters in the backlog, to assess where to go next. And the Cost of Delay should really indicate what really must be moved on. (I've seen more complex attempts, with a Weighted Shortest Job First (instead of Cost of Delay) that sometimes helps. But conceptually it feels more abstract and more overhead than just asking, how bad is it to put this off?) Also, having different ticket types can help a lot. Teams can figure out what's high value, but sometimes your business should be focusing on defects. Sometimes it should be focusing on spikes. Sometimes it should be focusing on features. If everything is just a ticket, in the same pool, it's hard to assess & align. reply",

          "text": "Your comment sparked an idea. Most ticket systems have what can become a somewhat useless “Priority” field which occasionally ends up meaning “above X or below X”.  We try to select the things from every priority that seem either valuable at higher priorities or easy at lower priorities, but a lot of time can get wasted reviewing the same tickets to decide. I am thinking a second similar field of “Risk” would be a great play on this Cost of Delay concept without adding much complexity and might help with more meaningful sorting. Something may be a low priority but a high risk(maybe it isn’t important in itself, but might represent a slice of a bigger risk), or a high priority but a low risk (like something customers want, but in reality is just a nice to have and the product would be fine without it). I suspect “Risk” could be arbitrary or whatever it means to a business, as long as it is consistent. Definitely given something to consider. Thanks for sharing. reply",

They should keep doing that, constantly updating as things change. (Kanban ain't Scrum.) Then the devs are instructed to always grab the top card. If cards pile up below that... meh, doesn't matter. Because that board owner is making sure it doesn't matter because they already prioritized it all. If some old card is causing problems by not getting done... well, the board owner needs to prioritize it higher. Cards that never get done didn't need to be done anyway. Then, actually follow the rules of Kanban. Don't run a Kanban board with a Scrum team and think it will work. They are fundamentally different approaches to moving work forward. Basically, it is not about your board, it is about your leadership and culture. BTW, I never put the backlog on the dev's Kanban board. I am the one who needs to worry about all that noise, so I only expose them to the small subset of work that matters. I do give them access to the backlog so they are not in the dark, but don't mix that with their day-to-day board. reply",

So if you dont check it, you are the one to blame. \nThe energy consumption is really a thing that needs to be talked about, but its not that bad as its often stated. We already use buttloads of energy to stream movies, stream games, do stupid crypto stuff and the amount of bad mouthing AI gets for its energy consumption is just not proportional.

Most products and services available to us today are unnecessary, unsustainable, destructive (economically and socially), and many represent a huge bubble which will hurt us down the line. LLM have exposed the sort of office jobs which have been automatable for years.

I don't know exactly what this will end up looking like but rsyslog is trying to do \"AI first\" in their primary product.  Rsyslog is or was a great light-weight and incredibly flexible logging daemon.  When I see them say \"AI first\" it makes me cringe.  If AI was a separate, entirely optional bolt on product and package I would not be concerned at all.  I am concerned they are about to bloatify, enshittify, hyppeify, crappify a great product.  Maybe they won't.  Or maybe they lose all sense of priorities and lose great developers and fade into history only to be replaced by some new daemon created without knowing all the lessons learned over the decades and we have to experience all those painful evolutionary steps all over again such as collaborating with hundreds of companies to narrow down interpretations of RFC's.  Or maybe they are just leaving out too many details for me. I see other products trying to do this as well.  My intuition tells me this is not going to end well.  I could be entirely wrong.  I really hope I am wrong.  Maybe it's just purely hype and products will not lose what makes them great.  Maybe it will just be some burnt development cycles.  Or maybe it will really just be making new application connectors, formatting and protocols to be more AI friendly. [1] - https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-goes-ai-first-a-new-chapter-... reply",

It's true that AI development involves intense competition, and that can feel overwhelming - like we're all just passengers on a train we can't control. But I don't think we're as powerless as it might seem. Throughout history, we've found ways to guide powerful technologies toward better outcomes, even when there were strong economic incentives pushing in other directions. Think about how we've developed safety standards for cars, regulations for medicines, or international agreements around nuclear technology. It took time and effort, but people working together made a real difference. When it comes to AI, we still have meaningful choices. We can support leaders who take these issues seriously, back companies that are genuinely trying to develop AI responsibly, and speak up when we see problems. We can also stay informed and help others understand what's happening - sometimes the most important thing is just having honest conversations about what we want our future to look like. reply",

For useful tools I basically wait until something starts appearing in multiple places like HN comments, YouTube tech videos/comments, or on Reddit.

Now we're considering it over Cursor not so much because of Cursor pricing change but just because Claude Code is doing so much better. That then leads me to an even more specific topic which is how I stay on top of info about the tools I'm using and for that I tend to stick to subreddits i.e. /r/ClaudeAI Some YouTube sources would be any of the \"tech-influencers\" like ThePrimeagen[0], Internet of Bugs[1], or dare I say Fireship[2] 0 - https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen 1 - https://www.youtube.com/@InternetOfBugs 2 - https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship reply",

          "text": "Really depends on how motivated and how much time you want to invest. I find Tinkercad to be an incredibly simple (and yet also surprisingly useful) way to build our simple to moderately complex parts, it’s free, and you can even sell parts you’ve created with it. It’s no Fusion360, but it also doesn’t have nearly the learning curve. Fusion is fantastic for complex parts, but costly if you ever want to sell anything. It is a combination CAD/parametric modeling program. FreeCAD has gotten better over the years, though it’s a bit clunky but has a lot of parity where it counts for 3d printing. Either one is going to require a time investment. Others have provided good resources for that. Personally, I’d start with Tinkercad to dip your toes in the water. Let your needs decide whether you should invest more time in another program (or not). You might be surprised at how for it can take you, and it will introduce you to the thought process you’ll need for designing 3d objects. reply",

          "text": "What do you want to make? A quick primer. There are two forms of 3D modeling - parametric solid body modeling, used in engineering CAD programs like Solidworks, and mesh modeling, used in CGI industries from programs like Blender. Hobbyist 3D printing currently exists between these two audiences of engineers who design for function and designers who design for design, and all the newbies get caught up in the mosh pit between them all and it gets crazy confusing. It doesn't help that some software (like Fusion360) integrates both in the same software, or that STL is a mesh format and not a solid body format (like STEP). If you want to make things that have any importance put on things like fit, function, dimensions, tolerances, etc., then you want to learn CAD (Solidworks) and find resources that teach the basics of mechanical engineering parts design (intro to CAD courses, basically). If you want to design from a more artistic standpoint, then use a mesh modeling software (Blender). Fusion360 is actually quite usable for both, but my problem is that the Fusion resources for functional design are frequently non-engineers trying to teach engineering concepts and it's just a longer and more frustrating process. BTW, their Maker version locks Maker-created files to ONLY be editable in Maker, which means upgrading to normal Solidworks renders your previous files unusable. The $60/year student edition is better. Avoid cloud versions of anything you pick. Up to you on your use case. This was also posted to HN 2 months ago and is a gold mine of useful info for designing for function. https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/ reply",

O3 Pro is better at abstraction, but grok heavy is better at bug hunting, and only doing exactly as needed. I swapped my openai pro license for grok, its good. Another big advantage is the context window size. Honestly I use these models all day long, and have felt that while sonnet 3.5 was ground breaking, but that anthropic is behind google, openai, and now xai. For tools, I use repo prompt + grok website. Personally think claude code is overrated, and hand building the context by selecting the files is far better for complicated tasks reply",

I've also been taking the approach of hand building context and copying and pasting it in for complicated tasks where I want lots of reasoning, like bug/security audits. I found o1-pro unbelievably good for coding, but when o3-pro was released, I saw the response length in ChatGPT was gimped severely compared to o1-pro, so didn't find it all that useful - it couldn't output long enough responses. I actually cancelled my ChatGPT subscription as it seemed like such a downgrade, though I'll probably try using again via OpenAI's API at some point, so long as the response length isn't capped.

Prior to this current generation of web applications, we had the advent of concepts like Object Orientated Programming and prior to that even C was a massive move up from Assembly and punch cards. AI has written a lot of code. AI has written very little high velocity production code by itself (ie. for people with no coding background). In Ruby on Rails, the concept of fast coding has been around for over 20 years, look up this concept of Scaffolding: https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/ So to answer your question, 1. AI has pushed a lot of code\n2. AI has pushed almost no code without the oversight of human software engineers\n3. Software engineers are pushing a magnitude more code and producing more functional utility and solving more bugs than ever before I don't know what the future holds, but I do think that this is not a new trend to use software to help humans build faster, and I don't think software has the ability to fully replace humans (yet). reply",

Roll to disbelieve on this one. There's no way that creating something like WordPress 20 years ago, before any modern-day web application frameworks, was anywhere near as easy. I'm not even talking React/Next or whatever - this was before RoR, before Django (or at least very early versions of both). I think it's pretty impossible to look around and not notice that technical advances have improved a lot of things in the world - why does it sound credible that programming itself hasn't improved at all in twenty years? Even look at languages like C++ today compared to 20 years ago, they're massively different - do you think all those changes to the languages are neutral or negative in terms of productivity? reply",

I just didn't think we were talking about that aspect, just how long it takes to actually build the code of WordPress. You might be saying that making the technical-building aspects of most technical products go faster won't necessarily have as big an impact as many programmers believe. Programming isn't the core of most products to the degree most programmers think, and instead the core of most products/companies is more about product thinking, sales & marketing, etc. I agree with this sentiment a lot. That aside, I think there's no question it's faster to program in Python or C++ right now, than it was 20 years ago. Things really have improved on the programming language front (and related libraries, and other advances). reply",

There is a big difference between AI autonomously writing code and developers just finding it easier to prompt changes rather than typing them manually. In one case, you have an automated software engineer, and may be able to reduce your headcount. In the other, developers may just be slightly more productive or even just enjoy writing code using AI more, but the coding is still very much driven by the developers themselves.

So let's take it on face value and say 95% is written by AI. When you free one bottleneck you expose the next. You still need developers to review it to make sure it's doing the right thing. You still need developers to be able to translate the business context into instructions that make the right product. You have to engage with the product. You need to architect the system - the context windows mean that the tasks can't just be handed off to AI.

So for them understanding the failure cases, and the prompting need to recover from those failures is likely more important than just lines of code their developers are producing per hour.

          "text": "It's everywhere. One example is probably blacksmiths. Before, each larger village used to have one. Nowadays, this is not the case any more as people order replacement parts for whatever metal piece that broke in your car, house, etc. The metal molding happens in factories instead. But in order you still need to have people who know how to mold metals. The early folks for this profession were blacksmiths. Nowadays you would not call them any more. But it's definitely been \"engineers with AI\". Same goes for industrialized food. The huge industrial bakeries still employ people who know how to bake bread, but they can do 1000x more than they could do if they had to knead the dough on their own, separate it, form little pieces of bread, order it nicely on a tray, etc. Now it's a machine doing most pieces of work, but they still have folks who design new bread products, adjust machines, know what to change in the formula if one particular product from one particular supplier is not available in the quantities needed, etc. A lot of the skills needed aligns enough with the traditional job of a baker that these factories employ actual bakers. As for software, whenever I use AI tools, I don't really feel that they help me save time much. But it's entirely possible that this is going to change in the future. They are only going to get better. And of course a lot of people say it's useful for them, so it already affects folks. Just because something is not useful to me doesn't mean it's not going to be useful to anybody. reply",

          "text": "I don't work for OpenAI and I doubt some random employee is going to come here and share what is likely a secret. I'm in the industry though so I have some idea of what's going on these days, both where I work and more broadly. AI is getting better at writing code. However writing code is just some fraction of the work of many software engineers. AI doesn't work independently, it needs to be guided, its work needs to be reviewed, tested etc. There are some domains where it does better and some domains where it doesn't. There's a range of \"AI\" work between auto-complete style work, assisting in understanding a code base, and writing code from some spec or doing other types work. All in all I would say it's a decent improvement to productivity for many situations. It's really hard to say how much and it's also not a zero sum game, as productivity improves there's more work. Something to keep in mind is that if you look at a modern software project likely most of the code executing is not code written by the developers of that project. There's a huge stack of open source bits executing for almost any new project. Specifically in OpenAI you also need to consider what type of software they are likely writing. Some of it may be more or less \"vanilla\" code and other is likely very specialized/performance critical. The vanilla code like API wrappers or simple front end pieces is likely more amenable to be written by AI whereas the more cutting edge algorithmic/scheduling/optimization work is almost certainly not done by AI. At least yet. As software organizations become larger there's a lot of overhead and waste. It is possible that AI can enable smaller teams and that has a multiplicative effect because it lets you reduce that waste/overhead. There are likely also software engineers who will become better/adapt to new workflows and some who will not. It's really hard to say where things are going but overall my sense is that this like many other innovations will lead to more software and more jobs and not the other way around. There are many moving pieces here, not just AI itself but geopolitics, macro-economics, etc. Where are those new jobs going to get created, what new types of software/technology are going to be created etc. etc. History seems to show us that we'll adapt/evolve and grow. reply",

I doubt that very much. I think the difference between situations where AI-driven development works and doesn't is going to be largely down to the quality of the engineers who are supervising and prompting to generate that code, and the degree to which they manually evaluate it before moving it forward. I think you'll find that good engineers who understand what they're telling an agent to do are still extremely valuable, and are unlikely to go anywhere in the short to mid term. AI tools are not yet at the point where they are reliable on their own, even for systems they helped build, and it's unclear whether they will be any time soon purely through model scaling (though it's possible). I think you can see the realities of AI tooling in the fact that the major AI companies are hiring lots and lots of engineers, not just for AI-related positions, but for all sorts of general engineering positions. For example, here's a post for a backend engineer at OpenAI: https://openai.com/careers/backend-software-engineer-leverag... - and one from Anthropic: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4561280008 . Note that neither of these require direct experience with using AI coding agents, just an interest in the topic! Contrast that with many companies who now demand engineers explain how they are using AI-driven workflows. When they are being serious about getting people to do the work that will make them money, rather than engaging in marketing hype, AI companies are honest: AI agents are tools, just like IDEs, version control systems, etc. It's up to the wise engineer to use them in a valuable way. Is it possible they're just hiring these folks to try and make their models better to later replace those people? It's possible. But I'm not sure when in time, if ever, they'll reach the point where that was viable. reply",

I've had good experiences with the GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code for working with Rust, specifically with Sonnet 4. Refactoring duplicate code into a helper function should be achievable with current agents. To replace existing code with an external crate , you could try giving the agent access to a browser (e.g. playwright-mcp), and instructing it to browse the crate docs. For anything that involves using APIs that may be past the knowledge cutoff for the agent's model, it's definitely worthwhile to have some MCP tools on hand that'll let it browse for up-to-date info - the brave-search and context7 MCPs are good. reply",

What helped me was shifting how I use it. I don’t treat it like a junior dev anymore, I treat it more like a second brain. For example: I use Claude Code to explore options before I commit to a design. I’ll ask it “what are 3 ways to abstract this logic?” and sometimes that alone gives me a better direction. It’s pretty good at turning rough notes or comments into starter code or test cases. That saves time on boilerplate. If I feed it a clean, self-contained chunk of code and ask for a targeted change (e.g., “convert this to async”), it often nails it. But yeah, across a codebase, not so much. reply",

It's also quick to forget how I like to do things or what libraries and packages it should use. So I either have to keep reminding it or fix up the work myself.

I think we have to build up enough code for it to start appearing like brownfield, before Claude knows how to engineer correctly. Which kind of makes sense if we view Claude Code as a junior engineer with infinite stamina. I also actually like to spin up Claude Code and Gemini in parallel to see what each one comes up with. Gemini will often do the simpler approach, but not often fully featured, and my solution often ends up taking the 2 solutions and refining in Cursor to come up with the final solution. reply",
