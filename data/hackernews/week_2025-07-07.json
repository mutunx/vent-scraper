          "text": "Commercial suppliers. No motel microwave is “smart”. No commercial kitchen is going to have the line cooks installing “apps”. BUT BE AWARE that commercial items have different requirements and tradeoffs! You need to research them before buying. Some may matter to you, some may be a safety issue, some may be technically or actually illegal to run at home. For example, commercial ovens may look similar to your home oven, but have zero insulation anywhere and NOT be designed to be installed next to anything except solid metal. But commercial and used commercial can be great. You can still get zero smarts devices, like microwaves with literally no computers in them, just a timer dial. You can also import many from the USA, but you’d have to check power requirements very carefully. Commercial equipment is often available in 240v in the USA but it may not be self-switching. But be aware that commercial dishwashers work - but even if you don’t get a massive Hobart machine that they’re designed for speed, not energy efficiency or silent operation. reply",

My new microwave with a \"child safety\" lock has a button combination you can use to disable the lock, but it forgets that setting on losing power, so you have to perpetually keep the sequence needed around if you ever have brownouts or blackouts.

          "text": "30 or more years ago I was at a law firm that had some specialized software to pump out the paperwork for residential mortgages. Every so often it would throw an error and refuse to run, which made it really popular with the paralegals who were trying to churn out a dozen mortgages a day. I called the software company. \"Oh, that's not a real error, we just prefer that customers check in every so often.\" I called them many foul names and found out how to disable that shit. Another company sold us perverted Xerox 635 daisywheel printers that were EPROM'd to only work with their particular shitty app-specific typewheels. I had a buddy with an EEPROM burner, and we had several unperverted 635s from which we could draw clean copies. We burned new chips for every printer in the building (65 of them). And back then there wasn't shit the vendor could do. Overnight we repurposed the printers for use with regular PCs and our cost for new METAL xerox typewheels was far less. reply",

The problem is when the job (or work-trial in our case) actually starts, it's just excuses upon excuses as to why he's missing a meeting, or why the PR was pushed late. The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

Sounds like a legit negotiation strategy: - You prefer a consulting arrangement over being hired. - The company prefers to pay less for the job. So both involved sides get a part of the pie that is negotiated about, and has to compromise on another aspect. reply",

There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.

While US employment is usually at will without a defined contract term , there are mutually enforceable obligations, including some definition of what the employee is obligated to do for the employer and that the employer is obligated to pay the employee at some specified rate assuming the employee's obligations are met. That's a contract. Exactly what the detailed terms are may be difficult to prove absent a single comprehensive written document, but it is a contract. reply",

          "text": "I have done it as a hiring manager, it's really not that hard. 1. You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

I know several people who spent months working for two companies: one full time, the other part time. The most productive few would reach two full time positions and actually keep delivering for over a year. The reason this happens at all is that sufficiently large organisations expect performance to be in a specific range - if it's too low you'll be fired, but going the extra mile will not yield benefits, as your compensation is decided by the assigned budget and promotions are rare. Case in point: a few years ago my former co-worker was given \"overtime\" which was actually a hidden raise, as management really wanted to keep him, but couldn't officially increase his compensation. The organisation for which we worked eventually cracked down on such practices, so he left to work at a place which would compensate him this much and more without resorting to such tricks. reply",

People who follow that stuff and “HR” crap are also the types that probably don’t realize that they’re a row in some expense sheet. First of all I’m not a corporate ladder climbing rat because I’d rather be the captain of the ship or THE GUY. It’s not about being nice it’s about completing the mission. Second, corporate psychopaths are usually not self-aware in the way I am. They do it out of selfishness purely for themselves, not for any other greater purpose that drives them (some ego shit). So I agree that those people are just selfish assholes and they hinder everyone in the long run. It’s not a good way to run. Ultimately, I do it because I’m a mission leader. The mission is greater than me, and as such it is greater than any or all individual on the team. If I’m dedicating a huge portion of my time to leading some effort, then either I’ll shape my team or replace as necessary. I’m not motivated my money nor “dominance” because those aren’t that interesting. And I could give no less fks about corporate ladders and proving myself. If anything I’m dangerous to dishonest people because they’re the ones who will doom the mission. Time is most important to me because I don’t get it back. Building something meaningful as a founder or leader takes time, and I don’t like wasting time and by extension effort without efficient resource optimization. Sorry if I’m harsh. When I was a team lead at $job I learned that most of this “be kind” and do a drum circle (anything but the actual work!) nonsense is window dressing for mediocrity and I just… I hated it. No dead weight. No babysitting. And no illusions.  I will go to war together with someone if they’re real and capable of sticking to the mission. reply",

          "text": "When running a commercial \"hacker space\" you have a ton of problems with strangers, it sounds like you're focused on a community hacker space which can be much smaller scale with fewer rando issues. I was on the board of a successful commercial/community hacker space for a while and our problems were not around money (we had a great community of paying members who also volunteered to maintain the space) but more people not using the space in ways that were acceptable to the community (mentally ill members trying to live there, people doing stinky projects, people abusing the tools, major disagreements about how to organize scrap wood, plumb the dust collection, etc). You probably want to avoid this complexity (at least, for now, until you start running into scaling limits) and stick to the \"computer club\" community. You will probably want an onboarding process with liability waiver. This is partly materials for parents to help them understand what their kids will be up to at your house. You're going to host other people in your place and there is liability that comes along with that. You will need to figure out how to keep your computer club from devolving into a lan party (unless that's what you want) and focused on learning opportunities by providing guided learning opportunities. LLMs are really good for helping you develop these activities based on an idea, including digging down into the details. Some things that kids might be into: building adder circuits in Minecraft with redstone (requires a basis in binary math and logic gates, which you can teach on paper and in minecraft). Scratch programs to fulfill certain goals (build a gravity model and get a spaceship to orbit; make a clone of a simple platformer video game they like; etc). After you have some ideas for projects/classes, you're going to want to write up a schedule so parents can help their kids get there. You should also provide volunteer opportunities so kids (and possibly their parents) can help out - maintain the website, fix the computers, etc. This not only helps lessen your workload, it also gives them a sense of community, that they're not just coming to hang out, they're responsible. Make sure to have community standards around cleaning up after yourself and enforce them. So, maybe after having a couple of scheduled classes, put out a call for donation of old computer hardware, and maybe have the kids try to assemble some working systems from whatever you get. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "Hi pkdpic! As one of the founders of the hackerspace you've visited out in seattle & a fellow recurser that you might've heard about the space from, I can drop to you some of my notes & learnings from two years in of devhack. the biggest piece of advice by far that I pulled from a bunch of european-style hackerspaces (& HacDC, my formative hackspace) has been: Just do it. Find a physical space, start doing meetups, promote it a bit and cool folks will find you. https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/attach... We at devhack took a very word-of-mouth based approach to promotion and that has prevented what a lot of comments here are trying to mitigate in terms of attracting the wrong crowd too quickly -- although I think there's lots of value in creating a space which supports eccentric folks / ppl with diverse backgrounds. Founding a hackspace is a very learn-as-you-go experience, has been very fulfilling and has had plenty of hiccups that we've had to react to as they come. The most important part is to have fun and create a fun space for you and your friends. Also, put a roller rink in your space. very important and wish we had that reply",

It’s a miserable tech job market right now; hunkering down and continuing to collect a paycheck is something you shouldn’t take for granted.

Your C-level execs have given you carte blanche to fuck around, without worrying too much about the immediate-term consequences. If they literally said to delete existing test files & generate new ones using AI, do it! And when shit inevitably goes sideways, you’ll be able to spend more of your salaried time rewriting those tests to probably look & work more like the original tests that you deleted. And while you’re learning to use AI, you’ll be burning the company’s funny-money on AI usage fees. At some point, they’re gonna realize they don’t have a lot to show for all the money that was thrown away in service of doing what they told employees to do. At which point, they’ll take a more measured & pragmatic approach towards using AI.  Do everyone a favor & help them get to that point sooner than later. reply",

What I'd suggest is adapt to it, find ways to push back. Obviously things like \"delete entire unit test file & have claude generate a new one\" is a bad idea. I've seen claude \"monkey patching\" a system so that it returns true to the tests. This issue is going to pop up in the future.

Even when mocks are BS, you can still test the thing they're meant to represent. 2) AI spits more code than anyone can review.

In the mean time, you get to contribute to the situation, instead of simply not being present. It's not going to be fun of course. I don't think we're ever going back from this.

My first job was in a C++ codebase, and I spent a lot of time learning the OOP design patterns (or really, the \"how do we make C++ behave well\" patterns). That said, the rise of OOP is probably measured in a decade or two. It eventually \"spawned\" whole new programming languages, that eventually got a lot of popularity. But this is over a much longer time-frame than how quickly we went from no such thing as AI coding, to (now) coding agents. It also didn't affect the entire industry in the same way - hell, some people were still writing assembly in the 80s as the OOP craze was winding up. I don't have actual stats, but I imagine coding agents are far more ubiquitious across far more industries/languages/stacks, for more quickly. > In my list I didn’t even mention the internet, the web, smartphones, and the cloud, all of which had a very broad effect on programming and programmers, The internet (or maybe the web) I'd say was probably the more transformative thing. Cloud affected a lot of things too but not quite as much and didn't make quite as big a difference to the day-to-day work. I deployed things pre-cloud and post-cloud (though honestly mostly during the early-stage cloud), and there wasn't such a big difference. Look, at the end of the day you can't just compare AI to other technologies blindly and say \"well they were big hypes, this is the same\". By actually looking at what it's doing and how it's affecting things, it's fairly clear it has a much bigger impact on the day-to-day work of programming, as opposed to anything else you mentioned. I'm not saying this is the end of development, for all I know this will mean more developers! But I think software development will look fundamentally different in 5 years in a way that is far more widespread than in any other of these changes. reply",

I use LLMs every day in my work (both to help write code and as a component of the thing I’m coding). They’re pretty cool.

Speculating about that is just noise. The engineer’s job is to find the signal.

Obviously, clueless people are going to misuse it. But let them learn the hard way. I've found that in organizations where the higher ups are incompetent if you try to signal the problem you become the problem. Then you're viewed as \"being hard to work with\" rather than trying to prevent a tragedy. Keep your job lad. If you do get another offer remember that there's always a risk when you change jobs. I.E. how stable is that companies funding? Will they want to do layoffs, too? Are their investors pressuring them to make cuts? Because if you're a new hire you can say good bye to that job. We don't have formal tenure in tech but there's still a human cost to firing people who have been long-time with a company. The decision makers have less attachment to a new hire so its easier to fire them in that respect (and how many decisions with fires are just arbitrary, number-based, bad luck.) reply",

          "text": "I've recently started using Claude Code, and also expected to not like it (based on using Claude Web to generate some code). I have 17 years of experience. But it's actually been fantastic. It's challenging in a new way: splitting things down into small enough descriptions that the LLM don't go down a rabbit hole it can't get out of. While also giving high-level guidance to plan for the whole project. I like UI design, but implementing it is tedious and slow. With Claude I can get a dashboard page done in less than 1 min, from a spec, that I can iterate on. Instead I can focus on the parts I care about, like backend. I need to nudge it to always care about security and storage concerns. I've seen O(n²) loops where O(n) would be sufficient. It keeps making enough mistakes that I'm not exactly out of a job. The best way to use Claude Code is to write those descriptions and use examples of what you want the output to look like, so take it in small steps and do manual corrections. However, you need to have seen some good code before using it to make something good. It's just a tool, like compilers and IDEs. I'm pretty happy I don't have to input programs using eight data switches and a latch switch on an Altair 80. And I'm now pretty happy I don't have to care so much about internal API boundaries, because doing a refactoring is one sentence away. However, I do keep running out of quota after 2-2.5h out of 5h. If I had a company sponsoring this, it would be a no-brainer to use it more. reply",

I would also add that it's probably pretty easy to fake it - in my experience management, especially executive level, have no idea how things actually get done. If they aren't prescribing a very specific workflow, you can create you own/install whatever tooling you want. It's also worth pointing out - if you really are sufficiently experienced, these tools could prove to be a force multiplier and may actually be worth an investigation.

It's ok at getting the first 20% of the project done, but that was never the hard part. It's always been the last 20%, and modern LLM's simply cannot do it. Not on large scale projects. New things have come and gone. So far the only thing I'm convinced of is, it's easier to get funding when you can claim you use AI. That's it. > I have never copy and pasted code into development from an LLM/AI helper Well that's simply a different reality from what my employer is encouraging. So not relevant. They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff.

This can be true, definitely was more often true in the past. But there is a time and a place for human expression, and probably isn't in code. Your human expression is likely helped by tools. I doubt you're writing in Notepad, but your IDE doesn't get thrown out the window because it can't fully replace you or write code for you. IF you are being blindly told to copy/paste from an LLM, then use that as part of your ideation and work from there, using AI tools as much as you can in ways that work.

Your post needs more detail if you want people to reply to your exact situation, but I think you can make clear arguments against doing this, then do this for 3 weeks, followed by the obvious: backtracking. Leaders are by nature often encouraged to try new things. Standing in their way won't help you, but you can warn them, do it, then help them get back on track. By being a team member in this way, you are not in charge, but you can build trust equity if these leaders stick around and have techy ideas in future. In my experience, I usually outlast bad leadership (and their associated ideas). You have to be correct and not act like you're the boss to survive it, though! reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

          "text": "Still working on:  an enclosure-compatible open-source version of the 2nd gen Nest thermostat. It reuses the enclosure, encoder ring, display, and mounts of the Nest but replaces the \"thinking\" part with an open-source PCB that can interact with Home Assistant. - The encoder ring which works like an LED mouse, but in reverse: Fully reverse-engineered and on its own demo PCB - The faceplate PCB, which does the actual control of the thermostat wires, has been laid out, but the first version missed a really-obvious problem involving the behavior on power-on with certain of the GPIO pins from the ESP32, so I've got rev 3 on order from the PCB manufacturer. Nest Thermostats of the 1st and 2nd generation will no longer be supported by Google starting October 25, 2025. You will still be able to access temperature, mode, schedules, and settings directly on the thermostat – and existing schedules should continue to work uninterrupted. However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist. It has been pretty-badly supported in Home Assistant for over a year anyway, missing important connected features. reply",

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

          "text": "To be clear, your work is next level awesome and technically more sophisticated than anything I've done. Mine is Javascript based and essentially a sprite screen graph rendering engine mixed with pixel-level effects on top of canvas, with an isometric endless world platform for runners and RPGs built on top of that renderer. I did ship one game with it, back in 2016. Since then, I've relegated my commercial work in that vein to threejs and pixijs. It sounds counterintuitive, but using your own codebase like this to develop a finished commercial product inevitably forces you to pollute the purity of the code. You start to develop sets of features that are specific to the game's needs and which force compromises that shear it away from being a general-purpose green field engine. Do I still dream of the day when I finish a new game built on my own codebase....? Totally. But maintaining a game in production and not having its needs override the intent of keeping a general purpose engone is like 4x times the work. reply",

          "text": "After 2+ years of maintaining the FOSS lightweight Reddit frontend Redlib [0], I realized that my niche but extremely detailed knowledge and experience of using Reddit's endpoints might be useful. After reverse engineering the mobile app and writing code to emulate nearly every aspect of its behavior, plus writing a codegen framework that will auto-update my code from analyzing the behavior from an Android emulator, I can pretty easily replay common user flows from any IP around the world, collecting and extracting the data. Some use cases: * OSINT (r00m101 just beat me to it by launching...) * Research into recommendation algorithms, advertising placement algorithms, etc * Marketing (ad libraries, detailed analysis of content given data not even exposed to the mobile app due to some interesting side channels, things like trend analysis, etc) * Market research for products * Sales teams can use it to find exact mentions of other products. Eg: selling crash reporting software? Look up your target accounts' brands and find examples of complaints. Plus a few more with more imagination. So I'm working on a site that allows user access to some of the read-only functions available here. Coming soon :tm:. Been really fun building it all in Rust, though :) If you're interested in anything here, email in profile. [0]: https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib reply",

It's an area with some heavyweight incumbents (e.g. Visio, Lucid) but I think there's good opportunity here to differentiate in simplicity and overall experience. I'm still in the fairly early phase, and I suspect I haven't quite found the best match of features to customers yet. From a dev perspective this area has a ton of super interesting algorithmic / math / data structure applications, and computational geometry has always been special to me.

          "text": "Years ago I was making a diagram editor with the intent of doing code generation from diagrams (like simulink, not stateflow). I started with splines for the connections and decided straight lines and junctions would be better for complex diagrams. I realized that a better way to internally define the connecting wires is via a set of lines and their connectivity (vs their endpoint coordinates). Imagine each line segment is defined by a direction (vertical or horizontal) and a position (perpendicular distance from the origin) Like ax+by=d where a and b are either 0 or 1. You also need to define which other lines it connects to. Given the list of connections you can then calculate the intersections at rendering time. By sorting the list of connections you can render the line without features at the start and end, and then draw junctions for any intermediate connections. The beauty of this would be to allow dragging blocks around and having the lines follow with the junctions passing through each other as needed. There is some housekeeping with this data structure (merging colinear segments that connect, breaking segments when needed) but the UI for dragging should be much better than anything out there. reply",

Before I got laid off - I was making it @ Autodesk. I have quite some experience dealing with LLM based applications - taming them into giving more sane answers. The best one that I have built so far lets you attach to any data sources (SQL/NoSQL/Files) etc and then just ask questions about them. Literally any question (even outside the schema) and it never makes up stuff.

I am very transparent about my work and I do not ask for payment beforehand and no compulsion to pay if work is not up to your standards. Also, before I take you as my client, we will do a call - this helps me to have a measure at your expectations/requirements and helps to build a bond which is something I really value.

At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails. Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon. Now it's time for something new. You can checkout my CV/resume linked above for lots more details, and please reach out with any interesting opportunities. reply",

I was jumping between leading, architecting, designing, programming and things in-between :) Last years I programmed mostly in C# (web services, aspnet, razor, ...) also desktop apps (WinForms, WPF, Avalonia), JS/Typescript (mostly for gui, I enjoyed mithril and now SolidJS). I also did some c++ for various small integrations (for example some plugin for Godot, some ffmpeg, ...) and lately studying Rust. Mostly worked with GPC 70% , AWS 20%, other 10%. I like to make GUI/backends that makes sense, are easy to understand (test with users) and performant/fast. Also to last years, with minimum dependencies. I also have experience with live events setup for small broadcast of events, networking experience I did tons of remote support with people around the world, also know how to use this information to make better programs (or design...).

          "text": "SEEKING WORK - Remote - A designer who can code!\nI have 14 years of experience in Fin-Tech, Journalism, TV and Media, Health, Science, and more. I've taken countless projects from 0 to 1 and worked for clients like JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, Rob Walling, Trello, Peter Diamandis, Syncthing, SimplyCredit and others. I'm experienced in Vue.js, Django, Phoenix framework, Quasar and many others, I've worked with most web tech stacks out there. I pick up new tech easily and like working on complex products. Case studies are on my website: https://gilli.is . I can provide the following for you: - Product Design — Whether you need a design from scratch, a redesign, or you're having issues with a small part of your product, I can design it. - Front-end Development — I can build the design into a pixel perfect product. This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort. I've worked with a wide range of frontend and backend technologies and can hit the ground running on new projects. I pick up new tech quickly, which makes it easy for me to adapt to different environments. - Analysis — Your users, know everything that's wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That's where my usability analysis comes in. I'll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback. - Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free. I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | US/Canada Remote | Toronto Hybrid I'm experimenting with a new model for CS education using advisors who follow and adapt to students' interests. The core idea is that students should learn how to learn early and to self-direct their own education. However, they need support for when they get stuck. At the moment, I'm looking to work with students who have deep interests in CS/tech, but want something more dynamic than a fixed curriculum program. Experience:\n* Self-taught programmer.\n* Worked on data engineering at a large hospital. \n* Ex-VC - worked on technology due-diligence.\n* Started independent R&D lab (www.ithron.com).\n* Designed this model based on my experiences hiring engineers. Engagement model:\n* Work with students 1 on 1\n* ideal age range is 16-21, \n* 2-3 hours of meetings per week + 15-20 hours of self-directed time\n* 3 month batches, can be extended to a full-year.\n* More info at: https://www.divepod.to Feel free to reach out at: frank [at] divepod [dot] to reply",

          "text": "SEEKING WORK | Remote | Lead Infrastructure Engineer I am a Lead Infrastructure Engineer with 20+ years of experience. Whether your team is stuck troubleshooting infra issues, needs extra hands on an infra-heavy project or is just lacking tech leadership on the DevOps topics, contact me and we'll figure it out. I prefer to work along the existing engineering teams, mentoring or training them while working together on the real tasks. This is a very effective and also a flexible way to learn and as a bonus, some work gets done on the way. I am located in EU (Estonia) and work remotely with occasional on-site visits. The usual topics are various AWS services, Elastic Stack, Linux, wide range of troubleshooting, infrastructure as code, logging & monitoring, managing cloud costs, but I find it rewarding to venture into new areas together with the team.

I remember using a mechanical typewriter with Midi-type connector and a printer driver (not sure what the terminology is) for C64. The typewriter manual contained all the codes to control the typewriter, like a terminal. Would be fun to buy one of those and try to re-implement your own driver. The mechanical typewriter had a buffer, you were able to type faster than the printing head could bring it on paper. reply",

We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots. Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot's position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on. Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 60 people and we're growing rapidly to meet demand. Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS. Some open roles: - Software Engineer, Full Stack - Software Engineer, Controls - Software Engineer, Machine Vision - Assembly/manufacturing technicians and robot operators https://www.monumental.co/jobs P.S. When we say full stack, we really mean it. Bolting things together, mixing mortar, embedded firmware, (software) build systems, React components and everything in between.

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

We are a founding team made up of ex-YC, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Harvard Business School with previous successful exits. We have a 6+ month customer waitlist and growing insanely fast. We're hiring our first engineer outside the founders. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, design the right solution, and build from zero to one. You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity. We care about slope, not where you are today. This is an opportunity to work in an insanely fast paced, high ownership environment while solving real problems in healthcare. We're happy to share more details on the role in person/on zoom. Please fill out this form if interested! https://wgwx7h7be0p.typeform.com/to/LV0t8OjI reply",

          "text": "I live in Australia and we have preferential voting. We also don't vote for a president but the prime minister is decided by majority of seats in house of representatives. It still ends up mostly being a 2 party thing. Supporting your team is deep rooted. However at least there is the potential for a third party to get in. But it suffers from the same statistical issue. If a quarter of voters vote green but equally across seats then that popular vote is not represented in the number of seats. It is a vote of a vote still. I wonder if we can move away from representation purely on where you live. Where you live means something. City vs. Countryside. Poor neighbourhoods vs. Rich. But if your issue is suffered by many but you don't all cluster together in latitude and longitude then that issue has less weight. Sorry forgot this is who's hiring! reply",

It’s very much a system level strategy, but more by way of democratized technology as opposed to head on disruption. I asked the same questions when I joined. We want to provide powerful technology to candidates that are not going to be supported by the two main parties. And we have some other qualifications, like not taking corporate money. The more that independent candidates can succeed and win, the more we normalize the electorate expecting something that isn’t just to two main parties. In a way, it’s the electorate that we are trying to empower by supporting viable alternatives to the current system. I’m glad there is interest in what we’re doing. I think we are on track too, making increasing impacts and I am excited about our growing team. reply",

Btw, there are other ways to get rid of employees which do not even need PIP. I have made peace with the fact employees are just means to an end. Always have been. Nothing less or nothing more. The power is extremely lopsided in favour of the companies. This makes so many things beyond the control of an individual [1]. Focus on things in your control: 1. Keep learning 2. Be debt free as soon as possible. 3. Invest and build a financial cushion 4. Eat healthy and exercise (I am pretty bad at this but trying to improve) 5. Develop an alternative skill(s) which can you put to use if needed 6. Never burn the bridges, no matter what. All of the above are easier said than done but I see no sustainable way of coping up.

I do a lot of programming, usually in Python and C++, and with a mathematical or algorithmic focus. For example, as part of my research I developed a BDD library that uses complexity theory to guarantee correctness with small overhead. Or recently, in my spare time, I created an AI for MTG (drafting, to be precise), using a transformer architecture with PyTorch. I am very enthusiastic about using or coming up with theoretical ideas that can improve outcomes in practice. I rely on having strong fundamentals, from mathematics over algorithms to knowledge of the actual hardware, to enable me to easily pick up new areas and tackle novel problems. Most of my research is the result of collaborations — it is important to me to both support my colleagues and be able to learn from them. Please feel free to refer to my CV for more detailed information, or my website ( https://nicze.de/philipp/ ). Currently, I am very interested in AI, but I am also happy to discuss any other interesting opportunities! reply",

I’m Caroline — a product leader and systems thinker with 8+ years of experience building cloud-native software across security, infrastructure, and impact-driven sectors.\nI’ve launched first-of-its-kind SaaS platforms, shipped secure cloud features from scratch, and led cross-functional teams through everything from GTM to compliance audits. I know how to get things built — and built right. I’m currently based in Texas (CST), but I’m open to relocating internationally for the right mission. I’m looking to join a sharp, focused team solving real-world problems with technical depth and clear ownership.

Email: nathaniel.bennett@gmail.com My name is Nate Bennett. I reside Thousand Oaks, Ca with my beautiful wife of almost 15yrs and 3 children. I'm a product-minded engineer who loves to think through and map out the opportunities and problems associated with developing a product. I have founding experience and I have worked remote for much of my career, thriving with both autonomy and team-based projects. In previous roles I have worked with designers to create user-friendly interfaces and interactions from Figma designs and through customer feedback as well as building out database schemas and APIs. As a former professional athlete, I am looking to join a team where teamwork is paramount and opportunities for growth and learning from others are a daily occurrence. I’m currently developing a SaaS application called “Great Job!,” a productivity platform for job hunters, learning roadmaps, and AI-enhanced portfolio creation workflows. I'm very interested in AI Engineering and have began to dive deeper into AI topics and use it daily to augment my coding. Away from the computer I enjoy working out in my garage gym, playing guitar, and playing outside with my kids. reply",

But there's no integration with formatting, stylesheets, or anything, right? In 2017 or so I wrote the maintenance manual for an earlier version of this educational 3D printer: https://www.ysoft.com/be3d It was about 350 pages with lots of illustrations and diagrams. The entire manual was a single giant Word outline. That meant all the headings, subheadings, sub-sub-headings etc. were automatically formatted for me, plus automatic generation of table of contents and index, all automatically linked to the structure of the steps in each chapter. The first edition took me about 6-8 weeks, the second edition under a month. Later on I spent 4 years working with DocBook XML and a professional documentation production system -- but I can state from personal experience that for a solo project, me and 1 engineer, Word in Outline Mode was vastly more productive and efficient. To the client's amazement, the final stage of print-ready layout took part of one morning at the end. I took one of their leaflets, laid out in Word, removed all the text leaving only styles, and then merged that stylesheet with the manual. Bingo, fully-formatted document, in corporate colours and fonts, with headers and footers and so on. Just a little layout tweaking, adding some page breaks and things. The ability to collapse all the levels down to just headings is an amazing navigation tool: it's like zooming out to an overview, then zooming back in somewhere else, while the text remains readable throughout. reply",

Fix THAT problem, and you solve a myriad of other related problems for entire populations.\nCharacter questions are forbidden in the USA as they might lead to 'discrimination.' But 'discrimination' is where one discerns a preference between something desirable and something undesirable? \nHistorically the abuse of 'discrimination' created the legal restrictions that foster this situation where a candidate's character cannot be assessed accurately.\nSoham proves that the people doing the interviewing are less discerning than they believe themselves to be. Good character seldom is discerned during an interview. Also 'good' character relative; what 'Christians' or 'Westerners' consider to be good character is different from what other cultures accept or tolerate.\nIn summary, caveat emptor. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

So both involved sides get a part of the pie that is negotiated about, and has to compromise on another aspect. reply",

People who regularly don't show up for work are by definition not \"top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates\" - in fact quite the opposite. That'll get you fired from PetSmart, let alone some bullshit $250k/yr software job. I think startups' freewheeling management and hiring practices need examined because this would be caught by the most basic of background or reference checks at any traditional business.

There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.

While US employment is usually at will without a defined contract term , there are mutually enforceable obligations, including some definition of what the employee is obligated to do for the employer and that the employer is obligated to pay the employee at some specified rate assuming the employee's obligations are met. That's a contract. Exactly what the detailed terms are may be difficult to prove absent a single comprehensive written document, but it is a contract. reply",

You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

I know several people who spent months working for two companies: one full time, the other part time. The most productive few would reach two full time positions and actually keep delivering for over a year. The reason this happens at all is that sufficiently large organisations expect performance to be in a specific range - if it's too low you'll be fired, but going the extra mile will not yield benefits, as your compensation is decided by the assigned budget and promotions are rare. Case in point: a few years ago my former co-worker was given \"overtime\" which was actually a hidden raise, as management really wanted to keep him, but couldn't officially increase his compensation. The organisation for which we worked eventually cracked down on such practices, so he left to work at a place which would compensate him this much and more without resorting to such tricks. reply",

One trick is converting HTML to structured JSON (just the visible text), translating that, then rebuilding the HTML. You can also parallelize translation and use faster models like Claude Haiku or Gemini Flash. For bulk tasks, traditional models like MarianMT via Hugging Face are much faster. Caching also helps a lot. Curious how your JSON approach works out! reply",

Looking at the list of hosts there I note that people still post articles from The New York Times despite them hardly ever frontpaging.  I think phys.org (ScienceX) wasn't a thing back then,  there was a time I thought I was the main booster (like I am for https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=coindesk.com ) but it's a big source that many people post from and others complain about.

Back in the day, there was a lot of Ad Tech / advent of big data. This is when Snapchat and Hulu were coming up. I’d go on Angellist and see who was hiring and who’d be down to meet. Now, especially post covid, I feel sparks of excitement. I missed the crypto hype in LA so that was probably wild and weird. a16z opened an office in Santa Monica and do their speedrun accelerator. Focused on games and media it seems. upfront hosted some cool cowork and mingle events too. Two meetups I regularly go to is AI Tinkerers and MLOps. Generally it’s the same small crowd. I went to a Ruby meetup which was cool too. Less of a young startup crowd. Maybe people got older and rich and retired early. reply",

          "text": "For me: 1. Neighborhood matters a lot. This determines the kinds of events you’ll go to and people you see regularly. I explored a lot before I settled some place that felt like home. I live some place with good walkability and being able to walk to a coffee shop or park has been very important. 2. Hobbies. Outdoor fitness, DIY/underground music, and board games for me. It took some digging to find groups I liked (some of which I found out about online and some by asking people I met), but now I participate in at least one event/meetup pertaining to these hobbies every week (more if I can). Ex helping out at a DIY show, run clubs, hiking groups, board game meetups. 3. Having a dog. I’m outside regularly bumping into people. Having a dog often sparks a conversation and helped me to know my neighbors. You don’t really need a dog though any way you can open a conversation is good. Compliment someone’s shirt, ask a question, etc So TL;DR walkable neighborhood that suits you, find something related to your hobbies and do it as much as you can, start conversations. Good luck, it took me years before I got into a rhythm. reply",

          "text": "You're still going to spend an unholy amount of money to have a decent standard of living. It's just math. Chicago, no need for a car, rent is 1600$ within walking distance of a metro station. \nA monthly metro pass is about 100$. 1700$. In LA, 2700$ for an apartment. 500$ car payment, 300$ insurance, 200$ for gas. About 100$ a month on stuff like parking and basic maintenance. 3800$. If you have an extra 2100$ a month to tell everyone you live in LA, that's great. But the next problem is most people in LA are struggling. It's complex, but this factors into the quality of people you meet. Personally it's the difference between driving around a 30 year old Instagram model who has no real interest in you, but expects you to pay for stuff vs dating an amazing 30 year old with a solid career. Outside of dating, in LA you have \"friends\" who will beg you for money and then resent when you help them out. This weird interiority complex develops. I've lived in about 3 major metros for any real period of time. LA is by far the worst. Concerts are fun, the food is good, but it's just a really hard place to live. Now 20 years ago, you still had 500,600$ apartments for working class people. It USED to be an affordable city. But that's gone now. I miss that Los Angeles. I miss my 600$ Ktown apartment, 4$ tortas, 3$ bottles of Soju. It was an amazing place once. Doesn't really matter if it's completely unaffordable now. reply",

If you are middle of the road earner, you will have to live in the valley or another suburb, yes. But even those are among the most prized places to live in the USA. Your quantitative approach intrinsically flattens the qualitative dimension out of the lived experience.  Where else can you find Mexican, Korean, Japanese, Armenian, and Thai culture alive and well within their own neighborhoods in a 5 mile radius? Or even all on the same block? NYC is the closest, but LA arguably has the better food and culture (people are more liberal and accepting in LA). LA is also ground zero for the resistance against the rise of Trump's fascist reich. For many people those things are invaluable, especially if they are non-white (which perhaps you're not, so that may be lost on you.) It's fine if LA does not offer anything of worth to you, but that isn't going to be the case for everybody. Source: the 20 million or so people that live in LA County must like something, because they stay there (and that number is always growing) despite being the most expensive place in the US. And for the record, I moved to LA 20 years ago. I remember the $600 apartments - I had one by UCLA. I am sensitive to the rising cost of housing (though the new state law about zoning should ameliorate that in the coming years). But the reason you move to LA isn't for affordable housing. Assuming you are good at what you do, you should not be making the same financial calculations today as you made 20 years ago. reply",

I'm definitely not white. Chicago is liberal. It has one of the only Chinatowns in America that's actually growing. Boystown is one of the oldest LGBT communities in America. I don't think I'm going to change your opinion here, but when it comes to numbers, LA is just a difficult city. If you have the money, and LA is giving you something you can get elsewhere, great.

I understand that the lack of insulation might be the cause of this, at least partially. But since it's already typically very hot in the kitchen, I can see why makers won't add external insulation: the unit passively losing heat might not be a real issue in production.

Every so often it would throw an error and refuse to run, which made it really popular with the paralegals who were trying to churn out a dozen mortgages a day. I called the software company. \"Oh, that's not a real error, we just prefer that customers check in every so often.\" I called them many foul names and found out how to disable that shit. Another company sold us perverted Xerox 635 daisywheel printers that were EPROM'd to only work with their particular shitty app-specific typewheels. I had a buddy with an EEPROM burner, and we had several unperverted 635s from which we could draw clean copies. We burned new chips for every printer in the building (65 of them). And back then there wasn't shit the vendor could do. Overnight we repurposed the printers for use with regular PCs and our cost for new METAL xerox typewheels was far less. reply",

          "text": "If it's a Maytag, Whirlpool or another older super-reliable machine then you might consider fixing it yourself (if you're handy with tools) or finding someone to fix it. If you want to replace it with a good washer, then know that there are shops who sell rebuilt/refurbished models of the most trustworthy appliances. Meanwhile for DIY-ers, parts are usually available and there are YouTube videos on most major models (telling you which models are best, how to fix/maintain them, how to run them, etc.). We have a Whirlpool Ultimate Care II that is about 50 years old and has been thru 4 generations of people. I've worked on it twice: once to replace a switch and the second time to replace some ratchet gears. Repairmen have also worked on it in my absence. Like most of the older washers, it's designed to be easy to dismantle and repair. It washes more gently than any other washer I've seen: consequently our clothes last longer. Wish the software I use was as easy to fix. reply",

          "text": "That's an insane amount - how old is the dryer? I've replaced two heating elements in my ~9 year old Samsung dryer, I think the heating elements were less than 50 USD. I did the labor myself so I don't know how much that would have been - you do have to take the dryer apart, but it doesn't take very long if you have experience, 15-20 minutes or less. I would not recommend Samsung - I've had to take that dryer apart more than 10 times to replace/fix things, I can't imagine how much it would have cost me if I couldn't do it myself. The only plus there is now I can literally break it down and put it back together very quickly when I need to fix it. Luckily the Samsung washer has been fine. reply",

I am in a similar financial situation and age ($6M liquid, $60k spend, 38, not single), and have been in burnout for a while and haven’t found the courage to quit yet. Similar burnout reasons as yours: nothing is horrible about the work but I feel deeply inadequate, I feel in my 20s I was a high performer with incredible mastery of my domain, and as the industry “progressed” complexity-wise and everyone became more advanced in their craft, I got left behind. There are many (most?) younger (and older) folks at my current company who are producing 100X what I do (this is not some kind of impostor syndrome btw, I literally had a trusted colleague say to me: “you really should be more ambitious and build more, much more”), and are hired on the same ladder, for the same comp. As you stated, that chips away at your confidence every day and it plants the seed for burnout. Similar worries as yours: I am quite honestly afraid of what I will do with my time. I would just be running away from work and not running towards something else, and having grown up with some money trauma I did not want to regret willingly stepping away from the high pay, but I think a forced layoff would probably be the best gift someone could give me right now. I hope for many more insightful replies to this thread. reply",

You close your computer after you put in 40 hours a week and go home.  You try your best to communicate in trade offs between time, budget and requirements and if that doesn’t work and you get fired for refusing to be overworked, why do you care? I’ve been working for 30 years from startups, to boring enterprise companies, to BigTech and now working as a staff consultant for a third party cloud consulting company.  Never once have I experienced burn out. Not because I’m special, I’m disciplined enough to say “no”, have savings (nowhere near what you have), and I’m always prepared to get another job - yes during the dot com bust, the 2008 recession and twice since 2023. I’m not in a position where I don’t have to work.  But I am in a position where I can say no to bullshit - being overworked, mistreated, being forced to return to office, say “no” to high pressure BigTech opportunities, etc. In your position? I would travel (well I do that a lot now including nomadding), enjoy life, work for a risky startup that will probably under pay you but you might enjoy it and worse case you can walk away, volunteer, etc reply",

There’s little incentive for them to bother competing with wrappers today. Over time, however, I do think most wrappers are doomed. Prices will inevitably equalize, and AI companies can rapidly capture a lot of market share with little effort — via custom bots, agents and the like. If a wrapper is nothing more than an optimized prompt and a beautiful UI, it will be crushed by the competition one day. That being said, wrappers that implement proprietary algorithms can still thrive in the long run. Of course, if an app is that good, AI companies might eventually go after it anyway, regardless of how advanced the app is. reply",

I tried asking it for the meaning of the lyrics of a certain song in my head but only gave it the band name, not the song. It picked the wrong band-song at first, but noted that similar questions were asked for the exact song in my head. If I ask GPT/Gemini/etc, it will say, \"I know the band, but which song?\" I think this sort of invalidates the rest of the question - most of the things that people just assume are wrappers are not.

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

It started as an experiment in writing LINQ-style queries over real datasets and grew into a full language with: - declarative queries built into the language - a register-based VM designed for analysis and optimization - an intermediate representation with liveness analysis, constant folding, and dead code elimination - static type inference, inline tests, and golden snapshot support Example: type Person {\n    name: string\n    age: int\n  }\n\n  let people = load \"people.yaml\" as Person\n\n  let adults = from p in people\n             where p.age >= 18\n             select { name: p.name, age: p.age }\n\n  for a in adults {\n    print(a.name, \"is\", a.age)\n  }\n\n  save adults to \"adults.json\" The long-term goal is to make a small, expressive language for data pipelines, querying, and agent logic, without reaching for Python, SQL, and a half-dozen libraries.

However, these thermostats will no longer receive software or security updates, will not have any Nest app or Home app controls, and Google will end support for other connected features like Home/Away Assist.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

The difference might be that I have this 'big' project called a 'game engine' that wraps them all up into some semblance of a cohesive whole.  For example, projects that are incomplete, but mostly just good enough to be serviceable (sometimes barely): 1. Font rasterizer\n2. Programming language\n3. Imgui & layout engine\n4. 3D renderer\n5. Voxel editor .. etc Now, every one of those on their own is pretty boring and borderline useless .. there are (mostly) much better options out there for each in their specific domain.  But, squash them all together and it's starting to become a useful thing. It just happened that I enjoy working on engine tech and I picked a huge project I have no hope of ever finishing.

          "text": "To be clear, your work is next level awesome and technically more sophisticated than anything I've done. Mine is Javascript based and essentially a sprite screen graph rendering engine mixed with pixel-level effects on top of canvas, with an isometric endless world platform for runners and RPGs built on top of that renderer. I did ship one game with it, back in 2016. Since then, I've relegated my commercial work in that vein to threejs and pixijs. It sounds counterintuitive, but using your own codebase like this to develop a finished commercial product inevitably forces you to pollute the purity of the code. You start to develop sets of features that are specific to the game's needs and which force compromises that shear it away from being a general-purpose green field engine. Do I still dream of the day when I finish a new game built on my own codebase....? Totally. But maintaining a game in production and not having its needs override the intent of keeping a general purpose engone is like 4x times the work. reply",

          "text": "After 2+ years of maintaining the FOSS lightweight Reddit frontend Redlib [0], I realized that my niche but extremely detailed knowledge and experience of using Reddit's endpoints might be useful. After reverse engineering the mobile app and writing code to emulate nearly every aspect of its behavior, plus writing a codegen framework that will auto-update my code from analyzing the behavior from an Android emulator, I can pretty easily replay common user flows from any IP around the world, collecting and extracting the data. Some use cases: * OSINT (r00m101 just beat me to it by launching...) * Research into recommendation algorithms, advertising placement algorithms, etc * Marketing (ad libraries, detailed analysis of content given data not even exposed to the mobile app due to some interesting side channels, things like trend analysis, etc) * Market research for products * Sales teams can use it to find exact mentions of other products. Eg: selling crash reporting software? Look up your target accounts' brands and find examples of complaints. Plus a few more with more imagination. So I'm working on a site that allows user access to some of the read-only functions available here. Coming soon :tm:. Been really fun building it all in Rust, though :) If you're interested in anything here, email in profile. [0]: https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib reply",

It's an area with some heavyweight incumbents (e.g. Visio, Lucid) but I think there's good opportunity here to differentiate in simplicity and overall experience. I'm still in the fairly early phase, and I suspect I haven't quite found the best match of features to customers yet. From a dev perspective this area has a ton of super interesting algorithmic / math / data structure applications, and computational geometry has always been special to me. It's a lot of fun to work on. If anyone here is interested in this as a user, I'd love for any feedback or comments, here or you can email me directly: tyler@vexlio.com.

Before I got laid off - I was making it @ Autodesk. I have quite some experience dealing with LLM based applications - taming them into giving more sane answers. The best one that I have built so far lets you attach to any data sources (SQL/NoSQL/Files) etc and then just ask questions about them. Literally any question (even outside the schema) and it never makes up stuff. My going rate at the moment is $5 per hour (subject to complexity and my preference) - capped at 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is around $200/wk at minimum. I am very transparent about my work and I do not ask for payment beforehand and no compulsion to pay if work is not up to your standards. Also, before I take you as my client, we will do a call - this helps me to have a measure at your expectations/requirements and helps to build a bond which is something I really value. If you prefer - you could directly schedule a meet @ https://calendly.com/suvarnanarayanan2g/30min?month=2025-07 If you cannot make the slots to work for the calendar above, please shoot me an email and I will do a meet at a time you are comfortable with.

At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails. Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon. Now it's time for something new.

I have strong technical foundations, good product sense, and have gone deep with AI/LLM tech both in the sense of being able to use it effectively, and in exploring the design space for products/tools leveraging it. Tools I use most frequently these days: Typescript, node, React, pnpm+vite. I've also done extensive work with three.js in the past.

Hi, I’m Vincent — a one-man consultancy for service managers who need a second brain, a sounding board, or someone who’s seen worse. With over a decade of hands-on experience in IT and Logistics operations, service quality, and process improvement, I help teams under pressure make sense of what’s actually happening, and what to do next. Common reasons clients call me in:\n– Support is overwhelmed and nothing’s improving\n– Tooling, processes and roles are unclear, but nobody has time to fix it\n– Team leads or Service Managers are stuck and need a sparring partner\n– Leadership wants answers, and all you have is noise This is call-a-friend consulting.

I was jumping between leading, architecting, designing, programming and things in-between :) Last years I programmed mostly in C# (web services, aspnet, razor, ...) also desktop apps (WinForms, WPF, Avalonia), JS/Typescript (mostly for gui, I enjoyed mithril and now SolidJS). I also did some c++ for various small integrations (for example some plugin for Godot, some ffmpeg, ...) and lately studying Rust. Mostly worked with GPC 70% , AWS 20%, other 10%. I like to make GUI/backends that makes sense, are easy to understand (test with users) and performant/fast. Also to last years, with minimum dependencies. I also have experience with live events setup for small broadcast of events, networking experience I did tons of remote support with people around the world, also know how to use this information to make better programs (or design...).

At the moment, I'm looking to work with students who have deep interests in CS/tech, but want something more dynamic than a fixed curriculum program. Experience:\n* Self-taught programmer.\n* Worked on data engineering at a large hospital. \n* Ex-VC - worked on technology due-diligence.\n* Started independent R&D lab (www.ithron.com).\n* Designed this model based on my experiences hiring engineers. Engagement model:\n* Work with students 1 on 1\n* ideal age range is 16-21, \n* 2-3 hours of meetings per week + 15-20 hours of self-directed time\n* 3 month batches, can be extended to a full-year.\n* More info at: https://www.divepod.to Feel free to reach out at: frank [at] divepod [dot] to reply",

I've taken countless projects from 0 to 1 and worked for clients like JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, Rob Walling, Trello, Peter Diamandis, Syncthing, SimplyCredit and others. I'm experienced in Vue.js, Django, Phoenix framework, Quasar and many others, I've worked with most web tech stacks out there. I pick up new tech easily and like working on complex products. Case studies are on my website: https://gilli.is . I can provide the following for you: - Product Design — Whether you need a design from scratch, a redesign, or you're having issues with a small part of your product, I can design it. - Front-end Development — I can build the design into a pixel perfect product. This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort. I've worked with a wide range of frontend and backend technologies and can hit the ground running on new projects. I pick up new tech quickly, which makes it easy for me to adapt to different environments. - Analysis — Your users, know everything that's wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That's where my usability analysis comes in. I'll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback. - Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free. I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.

It’s a miserable tech job market right now; hunkering down and continuing to collect a paycheck is something you shouldn’t take for granted. As others have said, use this opportunity to learn about what works w/ AI based on all the crap that doesn’t.  Your C-level execs have given you carte blanche to fuck around, without worrying too much about the immediate-term consequences. If they literally said to delete existing test files & generate new ones using AI, do it! And when shit inevitably goes sideways, you’ll be able to spend more of your salaried time rewriting those tests to probably look & work more like the original tests that you deleted. And while you’re learning to use AI, you’ll be burning the company’s funny-money on AI usage fees. At some point, they’re gonna realize they don’t have a lot to show for all the money that was thrown away in service of doing what they told employees to do. At which point, they’ll take a more measured & pragmatic approach towards using AI.  Do everyone a favor & help them get to that point sooner than later. reply",

What I'd suggest is adapt to it, find ways to push back. Obviously things like \"delete entire unit test file & have claude generate a new one\" is a bad idea. I've seen claude \"monkey patching\" a system so that it returns true to the tests. This issue is going to pop up in the future. Experiment with it on the company's dime even if you've checked out emotionally. You are still doing your job - improving code quality and making sure things run. The new approach seems to be doing TDD. One, as an engineer, you'll know when AI is bullshitting you with mocks. Even when mocks are BS, you can still test the thing they're meant to represent. 2) AI spits more code than anyone can review.

In the mean time, you get to contribute to the situation, instead of simply not being present. It's not going to be fun of course. I don't think we're ever going back from this. There's an entire generation of new coders, and new managers who are growing up with this stuff.

          "text": "I've been programming professionally since around 2003. I'd say I caught the late-stages OOP craze (or maybe after-craze) though not really the origin or rise of OOP. My first job was in a C++ codebase, and I spent a lot of time learning the OOP design patterns (or really, the \"how do we make C++ behave well\" patterns). That said, the rise of OOP is probably measured in a decade or two. It eventually \"spawned\" whole new programming languages, that eventually got a lot of popularity. But this is over a much longer time-frame than how quickly we went from no such thing as AI coding, to (now) coding agents. It also didn't affect the entire industry in the same way - hell, some people were still writing assembly in the 80s as the OOP craze was winding up. I don't have actual stats, but I imagine coding agents are far more ubiquitious across far more industries/languages/stacks, for more quickly. > In my list I didn’t even mention the internet, the web, smartphones, and the cloud, all of which had a very broad effect on programming and programmers, The internet (or maybe the web) I'd say was probably the more transformative thing. Cloud affected a lot of things too but not quite as much and didn't make quite as big a difference to the day-to-day work. I deployed things pre-cloud and post-cloud (though honestly mostly during the early-stage cloud), and there wasn't such a big difference. Look, at the end of the day you can't just compare AI to other technologies blindly and say \"well they were big hypes, this is the same\". By actually looking at what it's doing and how it's affecting things, it's fairly clear it has a much bigger impact on the day-to-day work of programming, as opposed to anything else you mentioned. I'm not saying this is the end of development, for all I know this will mean more developers! But I think software development will look fundamentally different in 5 years in a way that is far more widespread than in any other of these changes. reply",

Nor am I saying all big hypes are equivalent, just that there’s always a big hype about something , and you need a strategy to stay levelheaded about them despite the irrational polarized yelling you hear. I use LLMs every day in my work (both to help write code and as a component of the thing I’m coding). They’re pretty cool. But as an engineer you need to make decisions based on what they actually do , in your empirical observation, not what people tell you they will do, eventually, in their fantasies. Speculating about that is just noise. The engineer’s job is to find the signal. In my observation, I can trust an LLM to write code way more than last year, but I still have to keep it on a very short leash. Will it be better next year? I don’t know. Nobody does. reply",

But it's actually been fantastic. It's challenging in a new way: splitting things down into small enough descriptions that the LLM don't go down a rabbit hole it can't get out of. While also giving high-level guidance to plan for the whole project. I like UI design, but implementing it is tedious and slow. With Claude I can get a dashboard page done in less than 1 min, from a spec, that I can iterate on. Instead I can focus on the parts I care about, like backend. I need to nudge it to always care about security and storage concerns. I've seen O(n²) loops where O(n) would be sufficient. It keeps making enough mistakes that I'm not exactly out of a job. The best way to use Claude Code is to write those descriptions and use examples of what you want the output to look like, so take it in small steps and do manual corrections. However, you need to have seen some good code before using it to make something good. It's just a tool, like compilers and IDEs. I'm pretty happy I don't have to input programs using eight data switches and a latch switch on an Altair 80. And I'm now pretty happy I don't have to care so much about internal API boundaries, because doing a refactoring is one sentence away. However, I do keep running out of quota after 2-2.5h out of 5h.

Sooner or later you will be asked to fix all that AI mess in your company codebase and when you respond that you are unable to do so without a major, manual rewrite, you will probably get fired. Stay at your job for as long as possible, but start searching for a new position ASAP in an organization that declares up front that they do not intend to use AI for their codebase as a matter of company policy. There are actually companies out there already that make that kind of choice, but it might take a year or two for you to find such a job in the current job market. If all else fails, switch to the Linux kernel/driver development specialty with C/Rust for companies like Canonical. reply",

          "text": "I’d stay and actually try the vibe coding, but if it’s not working, only a bit. For example, try deleting one failing unit test and re-generate it with Claude. Then if it turns out mostly worthless, scrap it and restore the original test. Maybe the entire test is correct (and easy to verify), maybe you can take pieces from it, maybe it’s unsalvageable; if it doesn’t save time, write tests manually from then on until the next major AI improvement. Worst case, CEO fires you for not vibe-coding enough. Best case, you find a way for them to make your life easier. My prediction (based on some but not much experience) is that you spend only a small amount of time trying the AI tools, occasionally they impress you, usually they fail, but even then it’s interesting and fun to see what they do. EDIT: as for dealing with the spaghetti when others use AI; wait for that to become a problem before quitting over it. And of course you can look for opportunities now. reply",

It's ok at getting the first 20% of the project done, but that was never the hard part. It's always been the last 20%, and modern LLM's simply cannot do it. Not on large scale projects.

They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff.

This can be true, definitely was more often true in the past. But there is a time and a place for human expression, and probably isn't in code. Your human expression is likely helped by tools. I doubt you're writing in Notepad, but your IDE doesn't get thrown out the window because it can't fully replace you or write code for you. IF you are being blindly told to copy/paste from an LLM, then use that as part of your ideation and work from there, using AI tools as much as you can in ways that work.

Your post needs more detail if you want people to reply to your exact situation, but I think you can make clear arguments against doing this, then do this for 3 weeks, followed by the obvious: backtracking. Leaders are by nature often encouraged to try new things. Standing in their way won't help you, but you can warn them, do it, then help them get back on track. By being a team member in this way, you are not in charge, but you can build trust equity if these leaders stick around and have techy ideas in future. In my experience, I usually outlast bad leadership (and their associated ideas). You have to be correct and not act like you're the boss to survive it, though! reply",

Speaking of adversity the last 6 months I’ve: lost a job, split from fiancé of 7 years, got fat, lost a dog, lost an apartment, got diagnosed with adhd, faced strong suicidal ideation, sever depression and nihilism. But fast forward to current day - I’ve got back to the gym and doubled all my lifts and genuinely starting to get strong again, lost fat, made friends, started rock climbing and road cycling, progressed in my career and doing well at my new job, planned greater international travels. I’ve realised I’m unnaturally resilient and I can basically push through anything life throws at me. Even in my darkest days I still dragged my ass to the gym and hit personal bests. I do not know where this resilience comes from. I’ve realised over the years as a 30 y/o male no one is going to help you get to where you want to be, no one is going to have much empathy for you no matter how shit your life is, and that you control your own destiny and can only play the cards you’ve been dealt, but you alone can push yourself to greatness (whatever that may be for you) reply",

But I also don't like change and I have strong internal motivation, so I naturally resist giving up on things almost to a fault. I tend to remove emotion from decisions and I hold myself to high standards, which helps me stay committed to my convictions even under peer pressure or without external validation. If I believe something is right, I'll stick with it to the end rather than do what I see as wrong; even if there's a big gap between what I think is right and what others think is right, I'll stick to my convictions in the face of 'adversity' (which manifests differently depending on what we're talking about, which is why I mentioned it at the start). reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

We're tackling the growing complexity of US energy regulations by automating data validation, documentation, and reporting — turning what's now a painful, manual process into a seamless, secure platform. With a power engineering talent shortage compounding the problem, operators desperately need automation. We're driven by $1.7T energy transition investment, where new regulatory requirements create natural competitive moats and mandatory adoption. By leveraging AI to detect anomalies and flag compliance risks early, we help operators move from reactive to proactive, so they’re always ahead of the curve. As a founding engineer, you’ll shape the technical core of our platform — from building secure cloud pipelines and encryption frameworks to architecting time-series data storage and intuitive compliance dashboards. You’ll work closely with our team (a CFA with a decade in capital markets and a PhD EE from the power sector) to solve problems that sit at the heart of energy reliability and grid stability. Founding Data / Full Stack Engineer: • Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), VPC & secure data pipelines\n• IaC (Terraform / CloudFormation)\n• Encryption, IAM, audit logging\n• Handling batch + real-time ingestion (Kafka, NiFi, serverless)\n• Building the foundation for ML models that spot compliance gaps before they become audit findings Meaningful equity, full product/technical ownership, remote friendly (US preferred).

          "text": "I live in Australia and we have preferential voting. We also don't vote for a president but the prime minister is decided by majority of seats in house of representatives. It still ends up mostly being a 2 party thing. Supporting your team is deep rooted. However at least there is the potential for a third party to get in. But it suffers from the same statistical issue. If a quarter of voters vote green but equally across seats then that popular vote is not represented in the number of seats. It is a vote of a vote still. I wonder if we can move away from representation purely on where you live. Where you live means something. City vs. Countryside. Poor neighbourhoods vs. Rich. But if your issue is suffered by many but you don't all cluster together in latitude and longitude then that issue has less weight. Sorry forgot this is who's hiring! reply",

          "text": "no mention of any system-level strategy on the website. this may as well be another lobbying group. pumping more candidates (even good ones) into a busted system is like increasing the flow rate into a cracked bucket. good metrics showing how much more is going in, with little attention paid to how much is flowing out. i do appreciate the ambition to change things at a higher level, but there is nothing resembling significant disruption here. my suggestion would be to identify a single, core point of systemic leverage that can actually make a demonstrable change to the way things operate (i.e. patch the bucket or, better still, replace it). for example, if you can get a sensible cap put on the amount of funds that can be given in support of a political campaign (yeah, i know, good luck with that) or can instigate a nationwide movement for proportional representation, or tie up the practice of gerrymandering, that might get momentum for a bigger step. i'm sure there is lots i don't know about the role and potential for independents in the US (i live elsewhere), but the principle still holes that a problem must be solved by a higher level of complexity than the one that created it. so i implore you, don't stop what you are doing, but try to find the next step up into systems thinking or, even better, meta-systematic strategy, which is actually what is needed for serious political reform. there are, of course, many ways to shoot down my argument, and it is true to some extent that 'policy is personnel', but the level of systemic failure evidenced in recent years makes me think that such an initiative, while valuable in itself, cannot flourish in the way it needs to in order to be effective reply",

It’s very much a system level strategy, but more by way of democratized technology as opposed to head on disruption. I asked the same questions when I joined. We want to provide powerful technology to candidates that are not going to be supported by the two main parties. And we have some other qualifications, like not taking corporate money. The more that independent candidates can succeed and win, the more we normalize the electorate expecting something that isn’t just to two main parties. In a way, it’s the electorate that we are trying to empower by supporting viable alternatives to the current system. I’m glad there is interest in what we’re doing. I think we are on track too, making increasing impacts and I am excited about our growing team. reply",

Think of it as the Canva or Figma for full-stack applications: a next-gen, AI-powered builder that lets you create, edit, and deploy web and mobile apps instantly, right in your browser. WebContainers make it possible. Bolt.new brings it to life. Together, they reimagine what it means to build software lowering the barrier to entry, speeding up workflows, and unlocking creativity for the next generation of builders. We’re a globally distributed, fully remote team of passionate engineers, designers, and creatives building the future of software development. If you love shipping fast, solving real problems, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible we’d love to meet you. — We're currently looking for: - Events Lead (B2B + B2C Focus) - Customer Experience Engineer - Full Stack Engineer - Senior Applied AI Engineer - Senior Front-End Engineer (UI/UX) - Senior Software Engineer - Rails — If you are interested please apply at: https://stackblitz.com/careers reply",

          "text": "Documentation needs to be maintained. Period. There are no shortcuts. When people join your team, stress this point. In the onboarding, require them to make at least one change to the documentation during their first week. People tend to think that documentation is someone else's responsibility, and it just isn't so. The main problem is not a lack of documentation, but being able to find it. Search is woeful in all the documentation systems I've used. The only thing that can save the day is proper linking of related articles. By default, people tend to throw documentation into a hierarchy. While that works for many things, it creates a structure that ultimately makes it hard to find things. Most documentation is related to a few different areas or domains, and with a hierarchy, you can only put it into a single \"folder.\" Any time you add a piece of documentation, you should link to it from at least two different places. Spend a moment and think about the person who will look for the thing you just documented. Where are they likely to look for it? Link it there. If you ever look for something like OP, and can not find it easily, but ultimately do find it, add links to it in the places you looked earlier. Over time, if enough people do this, the documentation will get decent or even good. It's a solved problem in the sense that there is a solution, but the solution is not automatic. It requires someone to manage the process and the people to keep the documentation in a good state.

I tried putting something together to formalize the process of reviews and got nothing but lazy rubber stamps, even from people who typically did excellent work. Getting people to care is the hardest part, in my experience. The bigger the organization, the worse this problems seems to get. After seeing some people delete some big docs I wrote, which I think were still good, and changing documentation platforms so many times (usually to platforms with higher friction), my motivation to be a champion for good documentation has waned significantly. I still do write good readme files for my code, and end user docs for its use, but all the other little nice to have stuff I mostly just keep to myself in my own system.

Even just business processes often change quickly enough that information on the wiki becomes misleading. Now that said, I have yet to actually use a platform with a good search functionality too.

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

But 'discrimination' is where one discerns a preference between something desirable and something undesirable? \nHistorically the abuse of 'discrimination' created the legal restrictions that foster this situation where a candidate's character cannot be assessed accurately.\nSoham proves that the people doing the interviewing are less discerning than they believe themselves to be. Good character seldom is discerned during an interview. Also 'good' character relative; what 'Christians' or 'Westerners' consider to be good character is different from what other cultures accept or tolerate.\nIn summary, caveat emptor. reply",

Other states might be different, but stuff you do outside of work doesn't automatically become your employer's IP in California. There are some nuances and I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of it is that three ways to trigger the IP to attach to your employer: 1. You do it on-prem or during work hours (but work hours are flexible for salaried employees) 2. You do it using company equipment (say, company laptop at home) 3. It's reasonably related to what you or other people do at your day job If none of those apply, then you own it.  That's relevant to the discussion at hand because, at least in California, you could work from home for two companies with unrelated businesses and not break any rules. reply",

          "text": "I have done it as a hiring manager, it's really not that hard. 1. You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

I know several people who spent months working for two companies: one full time, the other part time. The most productive few would reach two full time positions and actually keep delivering for over a year. The reason this happens at all is that sufficiently large organisations expect performance to be in a specific range - if it's too low you'll be fired, but going the extra mile will not yield benefits, as your compensation is decided by the assigned budget and promotions are rare. Case in point: a few years ago my former co-worker was given \"overtime\" which was actually a hidden raise, as management really wanted to keep him, but couldn't officially increase his compensation. The organisation for which we worked eventually cracked down on such practices, so he left to work at a place which would compensate him this much and more without resorting to such tricks. reply",

They're trying to fly under the radar, and have likely kept this knowledge to only a few people. The organisation will never change their ways unless they get bad publicity or have to spend so much money that their c-suite gets involved. I would be wary of trying to negotiate the payment upwards in case you are accused of extortion; just explain you'll disclose publicly in 30 days, which is more than enough time to fix what I assume is a web app backend bug. You don't want them dealing with this kind of issue as a feature to be implemented when there's space in one of the future sprints. They may try at this point to negotiate the payment upwards, which is a matter for you and your conscience, but I would say that if you don't get something close to 100k, it's likely to be swept under the rug internally and they'll never learn from their mistakes. reply",

Schedule wise, I do some regular evening hours (2 / week) to catchup - that can be a real problem sleep wise. If you finish your calls late in the evening, especially the ones where you are the one doing the talking and presenting things, it's very hard to go to sleep straight after that. You need to add at least 1h of winding down time. As for motivation, from my experience, when I'm working on something I really like, I'm 10x more efficient that I would be in the office. When you start in the morning, you know that for a long period there will be nobody to interrupt you and you get a LOT more done. The opposite is similar though - when I'm not motivated by a project, it's insanely hard to motivate myself. But maybe it's a sign that the project shouldn't be done in the first place. reply",

I don't have much trouble being motivated to work, I am only part time for now anyways, but I do get out and do a daily walk before I do anything heavy for the day, so I'll do some meetings, planning, and admin in the mornings then walk then I have energy to sling code for 4-6 hours. Some days I just don't work, and I learned to give myself the day (rarely two) but get back to work with a strong day the following day to regain my momentum. I find momentum is key in working remotely, you have to maintain a steady pace and not go too hard or too easy or else you're going to burn out or develop bad habits. I tend to work whatever days are necessary, weekend or whatever. My life is very flexible, so sometimes I'll have a mid-week weekend and work the weekend instead. tl;dr: momentum is key, try and work at least a few hours a day and ensure you maintain a steady pace over time without doing death-marches or being lazy. reply",

Something I've learned with eating + time zones is \"find out when people actually eat, not what time you'd be eating if your clock was changed too\". Apart from cultural differences you easily conclude lunch is \"sometime between 11:00 and 2:00\" just by surveying ones neighbors. Add in a few hour time difference and suddenly it's impossible to schedule a meeting unless you guess, learn, or see it on their calendar when scheduling. reply",

IF (and it's a big IF) there is a route at work to more compensation then that is likely the best use of your time.

          "text": "For me: 1. Neighborhood matters a lot. This determines the kinds of events you’ll go to and people you see regularly. I explored a lot before I settled some place that felt like home. I live some place with good walkability and being able to walk to a coffee shop or park has been very important. 2. Hobbies. Outdoor fitness, DIY/underground music, and board games for me. It took some digging to find groups I liked (some of which I found out about online and some by asking people I met), but now I participate in at least one event/meetup pertaining to these hobbies every week (more if I can). Ex helping out at a DIY show, run clubs, hiking groups, board game meetups. 3. Having a dog. I’m outside regularly bumping into people. Having a dog often sparks a conversation and helped me to know my neighbors. You don’t really need a dog though any way you can open a conversation is good. Compliment someone’s shirt, ask a question, etc So TL;DR walkable neighborhood that suits you, find something related to your hobbies and do it as much as you can, start conversations. Good luck, it took me years before I got into a rhythm. reply",

LA's patchwork governmental structure generally inhibits progress and keeps wealth and development concentrated in small areas instead of benefiting the broader metropolitan area. That's part of why you can go a few blocks in LA and your surroundings will change dramatically, often for the worse. LA is top 1-5 in US cities by GDP (and to be fair so are the others you mentioned except for Seattle), so I personally see it as a hugely negative mark on our local and national character to have large parts of it be dirty, choked to death by traffic, have insanely high rents, etc. I don't know if other cities have quite as many structural aberrations in their governance as LA despite seeing many of the same issues - I don't know whether it would relieve or horrify me to learn that they don't. reply",

Chicago, no need for a car, rent is 1600$ within walking distance of a metro station. \nA monthly metro pass is about 100$. 1700$. In LA, 2700$ for an apartment. 500$ car payment, 300$ insurance, 200$ for gas. About 100$ a month on stuff like parking and basic maintenance. 3800$. If you have an extra 2100$ a month to tell everyone you live in LA, that's great. But the next problem is most people in LA are struggling. It's complex, but this factors into the quality of people you meet. Personally it's the difference between driving around a 30 year old Instagram model who has no real interest in you, but expects you to pay for stuff vs dating an amazing 30 year old with a solid career. Outside of dating, in LA you have \"friends\" who will beg you for money and then resent when you help them out. This weird interiority complex develops. I've lived in about 3 major metros for any real period of time. LA is by far the worst. Concerts are fun, the food is good, but it's just a really hard place to live. Now 20 years ago, you still had 500,600$ apartments for working class people. It USED to be an affordable city. But that's gone now. I miss that Los Angeles.

If you are middle of the road earner, you will have to live in the valley or another suburb, yes. But even those are among the most prized places to live in the USA. Your quantitative approach intrinsically flattens the qualitative dimension out of the lived experience.  Where else can you find Mexican, Korean, Japanese, Armenian, and Thai culture alive and well within their own neighborhoods in a 5 mile radius? Or even all on the same block? NYC is the closest, but LA arguably has the better food and culture (people are more liberal and accepting in LA). LA is also ground zero for the resistance against the rise of Trump's fascist reich. For many people those things are invaluable, especially if they are non-white (which perhaps you're not, so that may be lost on you.) It's fine if LA does not offer anything of worth to you, but that isn't going to be the case for everybody. Source: the 20 million or so people that live in LA County must like something, because they stay there (and that number is always growing) despite being the most expensive place in the US. And for the record, I moved to LA 20 years ago. I remember the $600 apartments - I had one by UCLA. I am sensitive to the rising cost of housing (though the new state law about zoning should ameliorate that in the coming years). But the reason you move to LA isn't for affordable housing. Assuming you are good at what you do, you should not be making the same financial calculations today as you made 20 years ago. reply",

There’s little incentive for them to bother competing with wrappers today. Over time, however, I do think most wrappers are doomed. Prices will inevitably equalize, and AI companies can rapidly capture a lot of market share with little effort — via custom bots, agents and the like. If a wrapper is nothing more than an optimized prompt and a beautiful UI, it will be crushed by the competition one day. That being said, wrappers that implement proprietary algorithms can still thrive in the long run. Of course, if an app is that good, AI companies might eventually go after it anyway, regardless of how advanced the app is. reply",

That's not including the agent stuff, MCP, context management, etc. Perplexity might have been a wrapper some time ago, but today, it's far more. I tried asking it for the meaning of the lyrics of a certain song in my head but only gave it the band name, not the song. It picked the wrong band-song at first, but noted that similar questions were asked for the exact song in my head. If I ask GPT/Gemini/etc, it will say, \"I know the band, but which song?\" I think this sort of invalidates the rest of the question - most of the things that people just assume are wrappers are not. The things that are only wrappers die out pretty quick because people would just ask ChatGPT instead of Essay Writer 2025. reply",

BUT BE AWARE that commercial items have different requirements and tradeoffs! You need to research them before buying. Some may matter to you, some may be a safety issue, some may be technically or actually illegal to run at home. For example, commercial ovens may look similar to your home oven, but have zero insulation anywhere and NOT be designed to be installed next to anything except solid metal. But commercial and used commercial can be great. You can still get zero smarts devices, like microwaves with literally no computers in them, just a timer dial. You can also import many from the USA, but you’d have to check power requirements very carefully. Commercial equipment is often available in 240v in the USA but it may not be self-switching. But be aware that commercial dishwashers work - but even if you don’t get a massive Hobart machine that they’re designed for speed, not energy efficiency or silent operation. reply",

Every so often it would throw an error and refuse to run, which made it really popular with the paralegals who were trying to churn out a dozen mortgages a day. I called the software company. \"Oh, that's not a real error, we just prefer that customers check in every so often.\" I called them many foul names and found out how to disable that shit. Another company sold us perverted Xerox 635 daisywheel printers that were EPROM'd to only work with their particular shitty app-specific typewheels. I had a buddy with an EEPROM burner, and we had several unperverted 635s from which we could draw clean copies. We burned new chips for every printer in the building (65 of them). And back then there wasn't shit the vendor could do. Overnight we repurposed the printers for use with regular PCs and our cost for new METAL xerox typewheels was far less. reply",

Given that you are in the EU, you might wanna consider something like Gorenje - a Slovenian company, they make plenty of \"smart\" appliances but they also offer the good old analogue stuff. All my appliances at home are from them, nothing smart, nothing wifi connected, awesome build quality, good looking, reliable and an awesome value for money. Oven, fridge and washing machine combined set me back less than 2k. The downside in my case was that the ones I got were not the most efficient in terms of electricity but I can live with that. reply",

          "text": "If it's a Maytag, Whirlpool or another older super-reliable machine then you might consider fixing it yourself (if you're handy with tools) or finding someone to fix it. If you want to replace it with a good washer, then know that there are shops who sell rebuilt/refurbished models of the most trustworthy appliances. Meanwhile for DIY-ers, parts are usually available and there are YouTube videos on most major models (telling you which models are best, how to fix/maintain them, how to run them, etc.). We have a Whirlpool Ultimate Care II that is about 50 years old and has been thru 4 generations of people. I've worked on it twice: once to replace a switch and the second time to replace some ratchet gears. Repairmen have also worked on it in my absence. Like most of the older washers, it's designed to be easy to dismantle and repair. It washes more gently than any other washer I've seen: consequently our clothes last longer. Wish the software I use was as easy to fix. reply",

I did the labor myself so I don't know how much that would have been - you do have to take the dryer apart, but it doesn't take very long if you have experience, 15-20 minutes or less. I would not recommend Samsung - I've had to take that dryer apart more than 10 times to replace/fix things, I can't imagine how much it would have cost me if I couldn't do it myself. The only plus there is now I can literally break it down and put it back together very quickly when I need to fix it. Luckily the Samsung washer has been fine. reply",

Your C-level execs have given you carte blanche to fuck around, without worrying too much about the immediate-term consequences.

And while you’re learning to use AI, you’ll be burning the company’s funny-money on AI usage fees. At some point, they’re gonna realize they don’t have a lot to show for all the money that was thrown away in service of doing what they told employees to do.

My first job was in a C++ codebase, and I spent a lot of time learning the OOP design patterns (or really, the \"how do we make C++ behave well\" patterns). That said, the rise of OOP is probably measured in a decade or two. It eventually \"spawned\" whole new programming languages, that eventually got a lot of popularity. But this is over a much longer time-frame than how quickly we went from no such thing as AI coding, to (now) coding agents. It also didn't affect the entire industry in the same way - hell, some people were still writing assembly in the 80s as the OOP craze was winding up. I don't have actual stats, but I imagine coding agents are far more ubiquitious across far more industries/languages/stacks, for more quickly. > In my list I didn’t even mention the internet, the web, smartphones, and the cloud, all of which had a very broad effect on programming and programmers, The internet (or maybe the web) I'd say was probably the more transformative thing. Cloud affected a lot of things too but not quite as much and didn't make quite as big a difference to the day-to-day work. I deployed things pre-cloud and post-cloud (though honestly mostly during the early-stage cloud), and there wasn't such a big difference. Look, at the end of the day you can't just compare AI to other technologies blindly and say \"well they were big hypes, this is the same\". By actually looking at what it's doing and how it's affecting things, it's fairly clear it has a much bigger impact on the day-to-day work of programming, as opposed to anything else you mentioned. I'm not saying this is the end of development, for all I know this will mean more developers! But I think software development will look fundamentally different in 5 years in a way that is far more widespread than in any other of these changes. reply",

We don't have formal tenure in tech but there's still a human cost to firing people who have been long-time with a company.

Worst case, CEO fires you for not vibe-coding enough. Best case, you find a way for them to make your life easier. My prediction (based on some but not much experience) is that you spend only a small amount of time trying the AI tools, occasionally they impress you, usually they fail, but even then it’s interesting and fun to see what they do.

          "text": "I've recently started using Claude Code, and also expected to not like it (based on using Claude Web to generate some code). I have 17 years of experience. But it's actually been fantastic. It's challenging in a new way: splitting things down into small enough descriptions that the LLM don't go down a rabbit hole it can't get out of. While also giving high-level guidance to plan for the whole project. I like UI design, but implementing it is tedious and slow. With Claude I can get a dashboard page done in less than 1 min, from a spec, that I can iterate on. Instead I can focus on the parts I care about, like backend. I need to nudge it to always care about security and storage concerns. I've seen O(n²) loops where O(n) would be sufficient. It keeps making enough mistakes that I'm not exactly out of a job. The best way to use Claude Code is to write those descriptions and use examples of what you want the output to look like, so take it in small steps and do manual corrections. However, you need to have seen some good code before using it to make something good. It's just a tool, like compilers and IDEs. I'm pretty happy I don't have to input programs using eight data switches and a latch switch on an Altair 80. And I'm now pretty happy I don't have to care so much about internal API boundaries, because doing a refactoring is one sentence away. However, I do keep running out of quota after 2-2.5h out of 5h.

It's ok at getting the first 20% of the project done, but that was never the hard part. It's always been the last 20%, and modern LLM's simply cannot do it. Not on large scale projects. New things have come and gone. So far the only thing I'm convinced of is, it's easier to get funding when you can claim you use AI.

They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff.

This can be true, definitely was more often true in the past. But there is a time and a place for human expression, and probably isn't in code. Your human expression is likely helped by tools. I doubt you're writing in Notepad, but your IDE doesn't get thrown out the window because it can't fully replace you or write code for you. IF you are being blindly told to copy/paste from an LLM, then use that as part of your ideation and work from there, using AI tools as much as you can in ways that work.

Your post needs more detail if you want people to reply to your exact situation, but I think you can make clear arguments against doing this, then do this for 3 weeks, followed by the obvious: backtracking. Leaders are by nature often encouraged to try new things. Standing in their way won't help you, but you can warn them, do it, then help them get back on track. By being a team member in this way, you are not in charge, but you can build trust equity if these leaders stick around and have techy ideas in future. In my experience, I usually outlast bad leadership (and their associated ideas). You have to be correct and not act like you're the boss to survive it, though! reply",

          "text": "I go through periods of genuinely thinking I’m capable of greatness, and periods of not caring at all about greatness and just wanting to be happy. Speaking of adversity the last 6 months I’ve: lost a job, split from fiancé of 7 years, got fat, lost a dog, lost an apartment, got diagnosed with adhd, faced strong suicidal ideation, sever depression and nihilism. But fast forward to current day - I’ve got back to the gym and doubled all my lifts and genuinely starting to get strong again, lost fat, made friends, started rock climbing and road cycling, progressed in my career and doing well at my new job, planned greater international travels. I’ve realised I’m unnaturally resilient and I can basically push through anything life throws at me. Even in my darkest days I still dragged my ass to the gym and hit personal bests. I do not know where this resilience comes from. I’ve realised over the years as a 30 y/o male no one is going to help you get to where you want to be, no one is going to have much empathy for you no matter how shit your life is, and that you control your own destiny and can only play the cards you’ve been dealt, but you alone can push yourself to greatness (whatever that may be for you) reply",

People who follow that stuff and “HR” crap are also the types that probably don’t realize that they’re a row in some expense sheet. First of all I’m not a corporate ladder climbing rat because I’d rather be the captain of the ship or THE GUY. It’s not about being nice it’s about completing the mission. Second, corporate psychopaths are usually not self-aware in the way I am. They do it out of selfishness purely for themselves, not for any other greater purpose that drives them (some ego shit). So I agree that those people are just selfish assholes and they hinder everyone in the long run. It’s not a good way to run. Ultimately, I do it because I’m a mission leader. The mission is greater than me, and as such it is greater than any or all individual on the team. If I’m dedicating a huge portion of my time to leading some effort, then either I’ll shape my team or replace as necessary. I’m not motivated my money nor “dominance” because those aren’t that interesting. And I could give no less fks about corporate ladders and proving myself. If anything I’m dangerous to dishonest people because they’re the ones who will doom the mission. Time is most important to me because I don’t get it back. Building something meaningful as a founder or leader takes time, and I don’t like wasting time and by extension effort without efficient resource optimization. Sorry if I’m harsh. When I was a team lead at $job I learned that most of this “be kind” and do a drum circle (anything but the actual work!) nonsense is window dressing for mediocrity and I just… I hated it. No dead weight. No babysitting. And no illusions.  I will go to war together with someone if they’re real and capable of sticking to the mission. reply",

          "text": "When running a commercial \"hacker space\" you have a ton of problems with strangers, it sounds like you're focused on a community hacker space which can be much smaller scale with fewer rando issues. I was on the board of a successful commercial/community hacker space for a while and our problems were not around money (we had a great community of paying members who also volunteered to maintain the space) but more people not using the space in ways that were acceptable to the community (mentally ill members trying to live there, people doing stinky projects, people abusing the tools, major disagreements about how to organize scrap wood, plumb the dust collection, etc). You probably want to avoid this complexity (at least, for now, until you start running into scaling limits) and stick to the \"computer club\" community. You will probably want an onboarding process with liability waiver. This is partly materials for parents to help them understand what their kids will be up to at your house. You're going to host other people in your place and there is liability that comes along with that. You will need to figure out how to keep your computer club from devolving into a lan party (unless that's what you want) and focused on learning opportunities by providing guided learning opportunities. LLMs are really good for helping you develop these activities based on an idea, including digging down into the details. Some things that kids might be into: building adder circuits in Minecraft with redstone (requires a basis in binary math and logic gates, which you can teach on paper and in minecraft). Scratch programs to fulfill certain goals (build a gravity model and get a spaceship to orbit; make a clone of a simple platformer video game they like; etc). After you have some ideas for projects/classes, you're going to want to write up a schedule so parents can help their kids get there. You should also provide volunteer opportunities so kids (and possibly their parents) can help out - maintain the website, fix the computers, etc. This not only helps lessen your workload, it also gives them a sense of community, that they're not just coming to hang out, they're responsible. Make sure to have community standards around cleaning up after yourself and enforce them. So, maybe after having a couple of scheduled classes, put out a call for donation of old computer hardware, and maybe have the kids try to assemble some working systems from whatever you get. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "I'm from Sac also. In ~2012 (just a bit before Hacker Lab) I remember some of the people from Parallax Inc in Rocklin getting together to start a hacker space (Dweeb Den[1]). I went to 4 or 5 meetings with attendance of around 20-40 people and I was really impressed with the community-oriented spirit that was forming. We had plans to get a booth at the state fair, distribute puzzles and cards[2] to attract attention, and were working on getting a 501c3. Just about that time, we heard about Hacker Lab getting started, and it was better funded and further along, so we pivoted to supporting Hacker Lab. It turns out Hacker Lab was SIGNIFICANTLY more entrepreneur-focused (which is fine, just not what I was looking for). I ended up disappointed that Dweeb Den got dropped and we lost that nerd/maker/artist community feel. I'd love to see something like that come back around. Unfortunately, my Charisma score is low enough that I'd have to be behind-the-scenes assistance in starting anything of the sort.

As one of the founders of the hackerspace you've visited out in seattle & a fellow recurser that you might've heard about the space from, I can drop to you some of my notes & learnings from two years in of devhack. the biggest piece of advice by far that I pulled from a bunch of european-style hackerspaces (& HacDC, my formative hackspace) has been: Just do it. Find a physical space, start doing meetups, promote it a bit and cool folks will find you. https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/attach... We at devhack took a very word-of-mouth based approach to promotion and that has prevented what a lot of comments here are trying to mitigate in terms of attracting the wrong crowd too quickly -- although I think there's lots of value in creating a space which supports eccentric folks / ppl with diverse backgrounds. Founding a hackspace is a very learn-as-you-go experience, has been very fulfilling and has had plenty of hiccups that we've had to react to as they come. The most important part is to have fun and create a fun space for you and your friends. Also, put a roller rink in your space. very important and wish we had that reply",

Easily top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates -- other startups will tell you this as well. The problem is when the job (or work-trial in our case) actually starts, it's just excuses upon excuses as to why he's missing a meeting, or why the PR was pushed late. The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. reply",

The excuses become more ridiculous and unbelievable, up until it's obvious he's just lying. I worked with an overemployed person (not Soham). It was exactly like this. Started out great. They could do good work when they knew they were in focus. Then they started pushing deliverables out farther and farther until it was obvious they weren't trying. Meetings were always getting rescheduled with an array of excuses. Lots of sad stories about family members having tragedies over and over again. It wears everyone down. Team mates figure it out first. Management loses patience. Worst part is that one person exhausts the entire department's trust. Remote work gets scrutinized more. Remote employees are tracked more closely. It does a lot of damage to remote work. > Other people in this thread are incorrect, it's not a dev. shop. I worked with Soham in-person for 2 days during the work-trial process, he's good. I doubt it's a dev shop because the dev shops use rotating stand-ins to collect the paychecks, not the same identity at every job. This guy wanted paychecks sent directly to him. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to hire other devs to outsource some of his workload while he remained the interaction point with the company. > He left half of each day with some excuse about meeting a lawyer. Wild to be cutting work trial days in half to do other jobs. Although I think he was also testing companies to see who was lenient enough to let him get away with all of this. reply",

Uber sells demand for transport.  They don't own the transport and the burden of owning, and maintaining the transport is pushed on to freelancers, who have less certainty of income than they would as employees might. Theres been lots written about the insecurity to employment that is created by more things offering gig jobs on one hand but not always ending up also offering part time or full time positions. From the customers side, apps like Uber provide a sense of certainty (visual map) that existing industries haven't been willing to invest the same kind of capital into and those apps as a result are not comparable or inviting. reply",

Take it for the single point of data that it is, but: I have met equally as many high performers who do NOT code at home as I have mediocre ones that did. And the number of programmers who code solely on the job is far, far more common than those who take their work home with them. Statistically speaking, at least in my personal experience, that makes the at-home coder notably worse on average. As someone that used to think like you, I think the only thing you're really doing is the boys-club-esque equivalent of what the old Ivy League managers used to do (Oh, he's from MIT! That's perfect, we only hire MIT grads here). You're hiring what you know because you understand people with that background more. You might find on the opposite end of the spectrum that someone with a perfectly equal skillset is laughing at the idea of taking on personal projects when he can just optimize for getting hired somewhere where they prioritize paying you to learn on the job. reply",

People who regularly don't show up for work are by definition not \"top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates\" - in fact quite the opposite. That'll get you fired from PetSmart, let alone some bullshit $250k/yr software job. I think startups' freewheeling management and hiring practices need examined because this would be caught by the most basic of background or reference checks at any traditional business.

Technically there is always a contract between any two parties who are cooperating; it doesn’t have to be formalized in any particular way as long as the cooperating parties have a common understanding of the terms and agree on them. Many companies that don’t use formal contracts instead put all the information that is common to all employees into an employee handbook, and the details that are unique to a specific employee into the offer letter. The offer letter given to a new hire has details such as their starting salary and start date, and once they arrive they are given a copy of the handbook and often time to read it and discuss it with a manager. The handbook will explain in detail how promotions happen, the work expected from for various job titles, any rules the employees are expected to follow, etc, etc. Together these form the common understanding that underlies the contract, even if there is never a formal contract signed by both the employer and the employee. Contractors, on the other hand, always have a formal contract. Often a contractor spends a significant amount of their time negotiating these contracts, especially the scope of work.

You can use an employer of record service which costs a few hundred bucks a month – it seems like a lot... but if I'm already paying a recruiter £12 to £25k to find me a senior data engineer in London on £80 to 120k that is going to want to WFH 3/4 days a week, I will gladly pay £400/mo for an EOR service 2. You can also not hire them, and use their services as independent contractors instead. I've never had an issue doing this with my finance teams, as long as the contractor submits a valid invoice they don't care who they are. Plus, it's good for cashflow (net 30 to net 90 is pretty standard) and the hire gets a nice tax save on their end. I do understand that at large companies it can be tricky, but IMHO at startups there is little excuse. I suppose it all doesn't matter if you're playing with unlimited silicon valley VC money, I've only ever had to deal with european investors and they love a bit of smart frugality. reply",

I've had nearly 4 years of it at a payment gateway and IIRC only one time was there something that had to be solved that night. When it happened, it was sort of my fault anyway; a good deal of the problems are (should be?) within the control of the people being on-call. And I think companies like payment gateways and cloud services which need people active at all times are also far more tolerant of things like spending a week reviewing a PR and such, so the frequency of downtime is lower even if the impact is much higher. Though I'd agree it's a staffing issue. 5 people in a cycle is fine. If you had a concert or something that week, just swap places with a colleague. When we reduced it to 2 people, it was not cool to spend half your time on-call. There's also policies like don't release on Fridays, don't release on a vacation week. If there's a tool for it, it would be flagging these behaviors. Unfortunately, we can't really control when partners go down. reply",

          "text": "I think we somewhat agree.. Uncompensated on-call is not acceptable. Even if you're not busy, there is an ever-present burden to knowing you could be interrupted at any moment that takes a toll on your personal time. But as long as the expected cost of downtime outweighs the financial cost of keeping someone available to fix it, on-call in some form will be inevitable. (There are a lot of instances where the cost doesn't make sense, and we should just accept the system being broken until 9am) I don't think on-call needs to suck though. IMO \"staffing issues\" (whether it's headcount, time, competing priorities, etc) are resourcing issues and I believe better tooling can absolutely help with that - either by reducing the resources required to fix it or by making the cost of the issues quantifiable. Thanks for the good luck :) reply",

          "text": "I'm certainly not at liberty to invite a random to cover on-call shifts for us, but here's some anecdata about things I've witness that made on-call suck. We began with free food delivery over the weekend, and the expectation that you'd take a day off the next week (\"unlimited\" PTO policy). Eventually they stopped letting us do that and now the \"unlimited\" in our PTO policy has an invisible limit, so you can't actually do that without it counting towards the invisible limit on your unlimited PTO for the year. Our monitoring and alerting is unusably noisy. Deviance is fully normalized. All our postmortems typically have a section stating that alerts were issued, but ignored until customers began complaining. Attempts to cut the noise down to a sane level have all been defeated by the ever present pressure to feature factory. TBF this is mostly an engineering self-own and I feel partially responsible for this outcome. The on-call engineer does a shocking amount of manual labor to paper over bugs in the product and un-stick users who fall through the (many) cracks. It is effectively a T3 tech support rotation. We've taken steps to tone it down to mere triage and channel this into pressure against offending teams' timelines, but there's a huge amount of silent cultural resistance and no one is being held accountable when a feature increases support load. I suspect this issue alone would make most bigtech engineers quit. For the (many) issues that require manual intervention, the on-call engineer cannot actually do anything unless 2 other engineers sign off on a PR (either to run a SQL query or to deploy some tool or bugfix to resolve the problem). This is more specific to the product I work on, but the sheer amount of 3rd party services we rely on means that something is constantly acting up and there's not a lot we can do about it. Our API client code for each service we use typically contains _at least_ one service-specific hacky workaround to keep things running in the face of bad behavior. The frontend team has no on-call rotation despite causing plenty of bugs on their own. Backend engineers are expected to triage what are clearly frontend problems. We stood up a lot of observability tooling for the frontend but it took years for them to even start to use it. More than anything, it feels like the moment I stop championing the issue, everyone stops paying attention and the on-call experience reverts to the mean. Other on-call engineers just sort of stop boyscouting and let the chaos wash over them while focusing on sprint obligations (can't blame them), and leadership takes their eye off the ball to chase growth (also can't blame them). Hugely fucked lack of accountability and the buck eventually stops at whoever is the poor guy holding the pager that week. reply",

          "text": "This is exactly how bug bounty hunters are being exploited for. Though it is on the good side about disclosure, calculate how much financial, reputation impact, negative publicity would cost the company and settle for a fair price and not a measly sum of 1k EUR. It is a huge red flag to keep it under the radar if they think the impact is going to be high. I'm sure it is high and that's the reason they want to keep it undisclosed while they silently patch it. One question: Was the discovery part of a bug bounty program? Or you stumbled upon it without any actual request? I'm trying to see the legal angle that might get down played there if you do not have the authorization to look at it. Being ethical is the only advantage I see if that is the case. Else, you should negotiate and demand a fair price and go for a public disclosure which will cause more harm than good for them. Everything has a price. Nothing in this world is free. Contact some good lawyer. Don't ever sign an NDA without vetting it out with a good lawyer. Fine prints matter a lot. As some of the fellow HNs mentioned, they will probably be looking at a huge impact and the reason for the NDA and a low sum as a token appreciation. They think they can buy their way being a corporate, any my advice would be to talk to some lawyers or contact a non-profit to help sort things out. Probably you could donate a % to them if you get a good amount. Hope you get what you deserve. reply",

The organisation will never change their ways unless they get bad publicity or have to spend so much money that their c-suite gets involved. I would be wary of trying to negotiate the payment upwards in case you are accused of extortion; just explain you'll disclose publicly in 30 days, which is more than enough time to fix what I assume is a web app backend bug. You don't want them dealing with this kind of issue as a feature to be implemented when there's space in one of the future sprints. They may try at this point to negotiate the payment upwards, which is a matter for you and your conscience, but I would say that if you don't get something close to 100k, it's likely to be swept under the rug internally and they'll never learn from their mistakes. reply",

          "text": "I personally prefer Gsuite + Slack. But I've been on that \"stack\" for 15 years (although I also still use excel). Hard to say if it's better, because someone coming from the 15 years in the Microsoft world may prefer that. One anecdote -- I just recently left a large, public company (that acquired the startup I worked for) and they were in the process of evaluating a move to Microsoft (to the point that they migrated some teams over). They opted not to make the switch and there were a lot of complaints from the testing group. For a 40 person startup, I think two ways about it: First, I cannot imagine this is the biggest priority right now. Presumably you're trying to hit some growth target. Is this really the thing holding you back? If you're in survival mode, this feels a lot like moving the deck chairs around on the Titanic. But Second, if you're gonna do it, it's going to be a heck of a lot easier to do it at 40 people than at 60, or 80, or 100. Overall, I wouldn't recommend doing it unless the ROI looks really, really good. If I was an investor or advisor it would drive me up the wall to hear that this is what you're distracting yourself with right now. And it's one of those problems that when you hit $MILESTONE, you'll have the money/team in place to handle making the migration go smoothly. reply",

I followed up on things by mobile chat in the afternoon but I was already checked out mentally by 2pm. Sometimes when I felt rested enough I gave it a little more in the nights and coordinated with early birds from Europe before I hit the bed. This went on for over 2 years easily. I gotta say I completely burned out and it took me a long time to recover. For the ones asking why?. The business outsourced some services overseas which became part of the critical path. reply",

Schedule wise, I do some regular evening hours (2 / week) to catchup - that can be a real problem sleep wise. If you finish your calls late in the evening, especially the ones where you are the one doing the talking and presenting things, it's very hard to go to sleep straight after that. You need to add at least 1h of winding down time. As for motivation, from my experience, when I'm working on something I really like, I'm 10x more efficient that I would be in the office. When you start in the morning, you know that for a long period there will be nobody to interrupt you and you get a LOT more done. The opposite is similar though - when I'm not motivated by a project, it's insanely hard to motivate myself. But maybe it's a sign that the project shouldn't be done in the first place. reply",

I had tasks which spanned a week or two just because they were deep technical work. But I was able to explain what I  did and what progress did I make to the room of engineers. Nobody has been asking me about deadlines or when would it be done, it's not that type of meeting. But it's a nice check-in point to see if I(or the team) move in the right direction and if I don't report meaningful progress for multiple days maybe I need help or extra eyes on my work. I would post draft PR with the code so other people can evaluate and correct my approach. This saves you from working days in the wrong direction. reply",

I tend to work whatever days are necessary, weekend or whatever. My life is very flexible, so sometimes I'll have a mid-week weekend and work the weekend instead. tl;dr: momentum is key, try and work at least a few hours a day and ensure you maintain a steady pace over time without doing death-marches or being lazy. reply",

Apart from cultural differences you easily conclude lunch is \"sometime between 11:00 and 2:00\" just by surveying ones neighbors.

Before, I had some amount of code reviews where I would ask \"why are you doing this, instead of that cleaner/easier way?\" and people would usually make the change. I would assume that they probably didn't know better. Now, I still have some amount of reviews where I ask the exact same question, and people say \"that's because [your favourite agent here] did it like this\". So now I consider they don't really care. Not sure how much it changes: as a maintainer, one couldn't trust contributions before and one cannot trust them now. People were opening PRs with code that they had never tested and that did not compile before vibe coding, so that doesn't feel very different. I guess it just feels a bit more frustrating to think that you are putting more effort into reviewing than they spent... well not \"coding it\" but \"asking their agent to make it\". reply",

In the last days I finished a major refactoring of the frontend. I’m now in the situation where the project is 20% vibe coded. If I were to start again it would possibly be less than that.

          "text": "There's two types of code, based off The Pragmatic Programmer. One is the prototype, you build it and discard it. You absolutely have to discard it, burn it. It's a search algorithm - you're searching for a business problem and surveying different spots. Second is tracer-bullet - ready, fire, aim. This is just faster than writing up and iterating on specs; the process of coding it determines the spec. Tracer bullets work because they operate in the same environment and under the same constraints as the real bullets. They get to the target fast, so the gunner gets immediate feedback. This forms the skeleton of your code. Vibe coding is great for both, but people get into arguments because they're talking about different things. Inexperienced people usually use tracer code when they should be making prototypes. If you're doing prototypes, then technical debt is absolutely not a problem. You should go in there with the mindset of burning it all. A popular myth is prototypes should never be in production - this is simply untrue; most major startups have pushed their prototypes to production then rebuilt it later on. If a prototype isn't in production, then how do you know that customers would pay for it? Just make sure people get what they paid for. If you're doing tracer code, then you want to be laying down tracks like tests etc. You should probably be doing TDD. TDD plays well with non-deterministic stuff. The big argument against TDD then was that you'd have to code everything twice or you'd have to put in the architectural effort to handle tests. Well, AI gives us the capacity for this. reply",

          "text": "I built an app for iOS and android recently with a combination of Claude, and cursor. I started off by drawing Claude a picture of what I wanted the app to look like, and telling it to give me the skeleton of an iOS app. (It did a surprisingly good job) Then I switched to cursor and iterated with it on making it work. Once I had the iOS app running, I got cursor to create an android app that looked and functioned the same. Super interesting experience - took a couple of days of iterating here and there, helped to have them in git repos for when cursor went too far off piste. Both apps work, they look pretty much like my original picture.. and the code is absolute trash. I don’t know swift, or particularly kotlin, but the code is horrendous. If you wanted to take them any further, you’d rewrite it from scratch. This was. Rating combinations of Claude 3.7, 4.0 thinking, Gemini 2.5, and chatgpt 4. (Switching between agents when one was getting stuck.) Observationally, they all had a much harder time with android and rarely produced anything that didn’t need fixing to build. Great for rapid prototyping in a stack I don’t know, but 100% tech debt. reply",

Your C-level execs have given you carte blanche to fuck around, without worrying too much about the immediate-term consequences. If they literally said to delete existing test files & generate new ones using AI, do it! And when shit inevitably goes sideways, you’ll be able to spend more of your salaried time rewriting those tests to probably look & work more like the original tests that you deleted. And while you’re learning to use AI, you’ll be burning the company’s funny-money on AI usage fees. At some point, they’re gonna realize they don’t have a lot to show for all the money that was thrown away in service of doing what they told employees to do. At which point, they’ll take a more measured & pragmatic approach towards using AI.  Do everyone a favor & help them get to that point sooner than later. reply",

What I'd suggest is adapt to it, find ways to push back. Obviously things like \"delete entire unit test file & have claude generate a new one\" is a bad idea. I've seen claude \"monkey patching\" a system so that it returns true to the tests. This issue is going to pop up in the future.

The new approach seems to be doing TDD. One, as an engineer, you'll know when AI is bullshitting you with mocks. Even when mocks are BS, you can still test the thing they're meant to represent. 2) AI spits more code than anyone can review.

My first job was in a C++ codebase, and I spent a lot of time learning the OOP design patterns (or really, the \"how do we make C++ behave well\" patterns). That said, the rise of OOP is probably measured in a decade or two. It eventually \"spawned\" whole new programming languages, that eventually got a lot of popularity. But this is over a much longer time-frame than how quickly we went from no such thing as AI coding, to (now) coding agents. It also didn't affect the entire industry in the same way - hell, some people were still writing assembly in the 80s as the OOP craze was winding up. I don't have actual stats, but I imagine coding agents are far more ubiquitious across far more industries/languages/stacks, for more quickly. > In my list I didn’t even mention the internet, the web, smartphones, and the cloud, all of which had a very broad effect on programming and programmers, The internet (or maybe the web) I'd say was probably the more transformative thing. Cloud affected a lot of things too but not quite as much and didn't make quite as big a difference to the day-to-day work. I deployed things pre-cloud and post-cloud (though honestly mostly during the early-stage cloud), and there wasn't such a big difference. Look, at the end of the day you can't just compare AI to other technologies blindly and say \"well they were big hypes, this is the same\". By actually looking at what it's doing and how it's affecting things, it's fairly clear it has a much bigger impact on the day-to-day work of programming, as opposed to anything else you mentioned. I'm not saying this is the end of development, for all I know this will mean more developers! But I think software development will look fundamentally different in 5 years in a way that is far more widespread than in any other of these changes. reply",

I use LLMs every day in my work (both to help write code and as a component of the thing I’m coding). They’re pretty cool.

Speculating about that is just noise. The engineer’s job is to find the signal.

But it's actually been fantastic. It's challenging in a new way: splitting things down into small enough descriptions that the LLM don't go down a rabbit hole it can't get out of. While also giving high-level guidance to plan for the whole project. I like UI design, but implementing it is tedious and slow. With Claude I can get a dashboard page done in less than 1 min, from a spec, that I can iterate on. Instead I can focus on the parts I care about, like backend. I need to nudge it to always care about security and storage concerns. I've seen O(n²) loops where O(n) would be sufficient. It keeps making enough mistakes that I'm not exactly out of a job. The best way to use Claude Code is to write those descriptions and use examples of what you want the output to look like, so take it in small steps and do manual corrections. However, you need to have seen some good code before using it to make something good. It's just a tool, like compilers and IDEs. I'm pretty happy I don't have to input programs using eight data switches and a latch switch on an Altair 80. And I'm now pretty happy I don't have to care so much about internal API boundaries, because doing a refactoring is one sentence away. However, I do keep running out of quota after 2-2.5h out of 5h. If I had a company sponsoring this, it would be a no-brainer to use it more. reply",

It's ok at getting the first 20% of the project done, but that was never the hard part. It's always been the last 20%, and modern LLM's simply cannot do it. Not on large scale projects.

They not only want us to copy-and-paste, they want us to delete otherwise functional code to make it easier to paste in AI generated stuff.

This can be true, definitely was more often true in the past. But there is a time and a place for human expression, and probably isn't in code. Your human expression is likely helped by tools. I doubt you're writing in Notepad, but your IDE doesn't get thrown out the window because it can't fully replace you or write code for you. IF you are being blindly told to copy/paste from an LLM, then use that as part of your ideation and work from there, using AI tools as much as you can in ways that work.

Your post needs more detail if you want people to reply to your exact situation, but I think you can make clear arguments against doing this, then do this for 3 weeks, followed by the obvious: backtracking. Leaders are by nature often encouraged to try new things. Standing in their way won't help you, but you can warn them, do it, then help them get back on track. By being a team member in this way, you are not in charge, but you can build trust equity if these leaders stick around and have techy ideas in future. In my experience, I usually outlast bad leadership (and their associated ideas). You have to be correct and not act like you're the boss to survive it, though! reply",

BUT BE AWARE that commercial items have different requirements and tradeoffs! You need to research them before buying. Some may matter to you, some may be a safety issue, some may be technically or actually illegal to run at home. For example, commercial ovens may look similar to your home oven, but have zero insulation anywhere and NOT be designed to be installed next to anything except solid metal. But commercial and used commercial can be great. You can still get zero smarts devices, like microwaves with literally no computers in them, just a timer dial. You can also import many from the USA, but you’d have to check power requirements very carefully. Commercial equipment is often available in 240v in the USA but it may not be self-switching. But be aware that commercial dishwashers work - but even if you don’t get a massive Hobart machine that they’re designed for speed, not energy efficiency or silent operation. reply",

Every so often it would throw an error and refuse to run, which made it really popular with the paralegals who were trying to churn out a dozen mortgages a day. I called the software company. \"Oh, that's not a real error, we just prefer that customers check in every so often.\" I called them many foul names and found out how to disable that shit. Another company sold us perverted Xerox 635 daisywheel printers that were EPROM'd to only work with their particular shitty app-specific typewheels. I had a buddy with an EEPROM burner, and we had several unperverted 635s from which we could draw clean copies. We burned new chips for every printer in the building (65 of them). And back then there wasn't shit the vendor could do. Overnight we repurposed the printers for use with regular PCs and our cost for new METAL xerox typewheels was far less. reply",

          "text": "If it's a Maytag, Whirlpool or another older super-reliable machine then you might consider fixing it yourself (if you're handy with tools) or finding someone to fix it. If you want to replace it with a good washer, then know that there are shops who sell rebuilt/refurbished models of the most trustworthy appliances. Meanwhile for DIY-ers, parts are usually available and there are YouTube videos on most major models (telling you which models are best, how to fix/maintain them, how to run them, etc.). We have a Whirlpool Ultimate Care II that is about 50 years old and has been thru 4 generations of people. I've worked on it twice: once to replace a switch and the second time to replace some ratchet gears. Repairmen have also worked on it in my absence. Like most of the older washers, it's designed to be easy to dismantle and repair. It washes more gently than any other washer I've seen: consequently our clothes last longer. Wish the software I use was as easy to fix. reply",

OTOH I personally would not use a gas dryer in a home. While gas is faster drying and lower cost, an electric dryer is simpler and less worrisome. Sometimes \"Less is more.\" And if you prefer an older electrical model, they are available! Perhaps a re-furbisher would take your gas dryer in trade? The last two maintenance items above should be done for  electric dryers too, since electric dryers can ignite trapped lint as well as can gas. See https://www.envistaforensics.com/knowledge-center/insights/a... I particularly like their suggestion to put a smoke alarm above the dryer, which I will do today! reply",

That's not including the agent stuff, MCP, context management, etc. Perplexity might have been a wrapper some time ago, but today, it's far more. I tried asking it for the meaning of the lyrics of a certain song in my head but only gave it the band name, not the song. It picked the wrong band-song at first, but noted that similar questions were asked for the exact song in my head. If I ask GPT/Gemini/etc, it will say, \"I know the band, but which song?\" I think this sort of invalidates the rest of the question - most of the things that people just assume are wrappers are not. The things that are only wrappers die out pretty quick because people would just ask ChatGPT instead of Essay Writer 2025. reply",

Org and general space member behaviors also need boundaries, one of which is to include group decisions, votes, or whatever made as an official decision are closed when a decision is made, and is not forever a talking point until the relentless get their way. Shared anything brings out the worst in people, and your organization needs to expect it, because the stubborn and mentally ill fail to be entertaining when real finances of multiple people are on the line every month. It's amazing how many normal people are downright crazy when group responsibilities and financial commitments are on the line. reply",

People who follow that stuff and “HR” crap are also the types that probably don’t realize that they’re a row in some expense sheet. First of all I’m not a corporate ladder climbing rat because I’d rather be the captain of the ship or THE GUY. It’s not about being nice it’s about completing the mission. Second, corporate psychopaths are usually not self-aware in the way I am. They do it out of selfishness purely for themselves, not for any other greater purpose that drives them (some ego shit). So I agree that those people are just selfish assholes and they hinder everyone in the long run. It’s not a good way to run. Ultimately, I do it because I’m a mission leader. The mission is greater than me, and as such it is greater than any or all individual on the team. If I’m dedicating a huge portion of my time to leading some effort, then either I’ll shape my team or replace as necessary. I’m not motivated my money nor “dominance” because those aren’t that interesting. And I could give no less fks about corporate ladders and proving myself. If anything I’m dangerous to dishonest people because they’re the ones who will doom the mission. Time is most important to me because I don’t get it back. Building something meaningful as a founder or leader takes time, and I don’t like wasting time and by extension effort without efficient resource optimization. Sorry if I’m harsh. When I was a team lead at $job I learned that most of this “be kind” and do a drum circle (anything but the actual work!) nonsense is window dressing for mediocrity and I just… I hated it. No dead weight. No babysitting. And no illusions.  I will go to war together with someone if they’re real and capable of sticking to the mission. reply",

          "text": "When running a commercial \"hacker space\" you have a ton of problems with strangers, it sounds like you're focused on a community hacker space which can be much smaller scale with fewer rando issues. I was on the board of a successful commercial/community hacker space for a while and our problems were not around money (we had a great community of paying members who also volunteered to maintain the space) but more people not using the space in ways that were acceptable to the community (mentally ill members trying to live there, people doing stinky projects, people abusing the tools, major disagreements about how to organize scrap wood, plumb the dust collection, etc). You probably want to avoid this complexity (at least, for now, until you start running into scaling limits) and stick to the \"computer club\" community. You will probably want an onboarding process with liability waiver. This is partly materials for parents to help them understand what their kids will be up to at your house. You're going to host other people in your place and there is liability that comes along with that. You will need to figure out how to keep your computer club from devolving into a lan party (unless that's what you want) and focused on learning opportunities by providing guided learning opportunities. LLMs are really good for helping you develop these activities based on an idea, including digging down into the details. Some things that kids might be into: building adder circuits in Minecraft with redstone (requires a basis in binary math and logic gates, which you can teach on paper and in minecraft). Scratch programs to fulfill certain goals (build a gravity model and get a spaceship to orbit; make a clone of a simple platformer video game they like; etc). After you have some ideas for projects/classes, you're going to want to write up a schedule so parents can help their kids get there. You should also provide volunteer opportunities so kids (and possibly their parents) can help out - maintain the website, fix the computers, etc. This not only helps lessen your workload, it also gives them a sense of community, that they're not just coming to hang out, they're responsible. Make sure to have community standards around cleaning up after yourself and enforce them. So, maybe after having a couple of scheduled classes, put out a call for donation of old computer hardware, and maybe have the kids try to assemble some working systems from whatever you get. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "I'm from Sac also. In ~2012 (just a bit before Hacker Lab) I remember some of the people from Parallax Inc in Rocklin getting together to start a hacker space (Dweeb Den[1]). I went to 4 or 5 meetings with attendance of around 20-40 people and I was really impressed with the community-oriented spirit that was forming. We had plans to get a booth at the state fair, distribute puzzles and cards[2] to attract attention, and were working on getting a 501c3. Just about that time, we heard about Hacker Lab getting started, and it was better funded and further along, so we pivoted to supporting Hacker Lab. It turns out Hacker Lab was SIGNIFICANTLY more entrepreneur-focused (which is fine, just not what I was looking for). I ended up disappointed that Dweeb Den got dropped and we lost that nerd/maker/artist community feel. I'd love to see something like that come back around. Unfortunately, my Charisma score is low enough that I'd have to be behind-the-scenes assistance in starting anything of the sort.

As one of the founders of the hackerspace you've visited out in seattle & a fellow recurser that you might've heard about the space from, I can drop to you some of my notes & learnings from two years in of devhack. the biggest piece of advice by far that I pulled from a bunch of european-style hackerspaces (& HacDC, my formative hackspace) has been: Just do it. Find a physical space, start doing meetups, promote it a bit and cool folks will find you. https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/attach... We at devhack took a very word-of-mouth based approach to promotion and that has prevented what a lot of comments here are trying to mitigate in terms of attracting the wrong crowd too quickly -- although I think there's lots of value in creating a space which supports eccentric folks / ppl with diverse backgrounds. Founding a hackspace is a very learn-as-you-go experience, has been very fulfilling and has had plenty of hiccups that we've had to react to as they come. The most important part is to have fun and create a fun space for you and your friends. Also, put a roller rink in your space. very important and wish we had that reply",
