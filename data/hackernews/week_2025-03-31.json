The trustless part, fundamentally, comes from records being signed by the authors, each device/user keeping track of signatures (ids) seen, and each device periodically publishing all ids it's aware of: that seems to defeat all attacks or accidental corruptions I care about. My most demanding use case is multi-user expense tracking. Legal/financial document (a la google drive), family photo tracking (a la google photos) is also up there.<p>Also, I've recently picked up modeling my financial choices and circumstances in Python. Modeling uncertainty is especially interesting I've found. I might share the Jupyter notebook some time to get some feedback.</p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43532605&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343532605\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

          "text": "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Some time ago, I began searching for Python-related events and discovered that many PUGs (local Python User Groups) had disappeared sometime around COVID (at least my local PUGs). After analyzing the ones listed on the official Python website, I found only about 18% were still active, with most hosted on Meetup. This makes sense, as maintaining a community requires time and money, which small PUGs don't have.  Meetup can be costly for those starting local Python User Groups, but it's very cheap for big communities. IMO Meetup is not the best place for PUGs, as they are not big by default.<p>PUGs need a way to communicate and broadcast, to be discovered, but it doesn't necessarily need all of Meetup's features. Also, PUGs probably don't want to be tied to Facebook or other social media platforms. It'd be best if they allowed a simple ownership transfer, once you get tired of organizing.<p>That's why I created <a href=\"https://pythonuser.group/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pythonuser.group/</a> - a lightweight side project that, despite being rough around the edges, fulfills the core need: allowing people to discover PUGs worldwide for free. The platform costs me almost nothing to maintain. Allows to subscribe to local PUGs via RSS (not sure if it works). I'll add \"export all my PUG data\" once someone requests this feature.<p>It's the first time I share it with the world. Please don't treat it as prod-ready.

There’s a CLI tool that inspects all the project code and generates loads of metadata. This can include:<p>• services used<p>• all the HTTP routes, inputs and outputs<p>• OpenAPI documentation<p>• schemas to validate against<p>• typed fetch client<p>• typed WebSocket client\n(and more)<p>The design decision was also to make it follow a function-based approach, which means your product code is just functions (that get given all the services required). And you have controllers that wire them up to different transport protocols.<p>This allows interesting design concepts, like writing WebSocket code via serverless format, while allowing it to be deployed via a single process or distributed/serverless. Or progressive enhancement, allowing backend functions to work as HTTP, but also work via Server-Sent Events if a stream is provided.<p>It also allows functions to be called directly from Next.js and full-stack development frameworks without needing to run on a separate server or use their API endpoints (not a huge advocate, but it helps a lot with SSR). Gave a talk about that last week at the Node.js meetup in Berlin.<p>It’s still not 1.0 and there are breaking changes while I include more use cases.<p>Upcoming changes:<p>• use Request and Response objects to make it truly runtime agnostic (currently each adapter has its own thin layer, which tbf is still needed by many that don’t adopt the web spec)<p>• smarter code splitting (this will reduce bundle size by tree-shaking anything not needed on a per-function basis)<p>• queues (one more form of transport)<p>Check it out, would love feedback!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43532088&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343532088\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

All social data (issues, comments, PRs, other repo metadata) is stored “on-proto”—in your AT Protocol PDS.<p>We don’t just plan to reimplement GitHub, but rethink and improve on the status quo. For instance, we plan to make stacked PRs and stacked diff-based reviews first-class citizens of the platform.<p>Right now, our pull request feature is rather simplistic but very useful still: you paste your git diff output, and “resubmit” for a new round of review (if necessary).

My network cupboard is a mess, and I've been slowly CADing and test-printing parts for a 8.5 inch server rack system. I've managed to get some nice side rails, and I'm currently doing some test prints for a mount for a Lenovo M700 computer, which I like for lightweight server stuff (the one I have is currently running my homeassistant and a couple of other docker things, and I'm going to be buying another to use as a NAS). I'm also slowly working on rewriting my website backend to pull projects off external drives, reformat them into blog pages and automatically update my website to use them. Currently I'm still at the early testing stage, and I have quite a way to go, but the basic parts are there.<p>The 8.5 inch racking system was inspired by Jeff Geerling's video about 10 inch rack, but shrunk even further to allow me to fit it on my 3D printer bed (8.6 inch square). I currently have parts for the top and bottom of the rack, as well as 1U and 2U expansions that you can slot together to make the rack as tall as you want. I'm also thinking about making a side attachment system so you can clip fans onto the side or similar. Once I have a working rack with several units in it, I'll probably end up publishing the parts and a writeup about it</p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43532505&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343532505\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

It's more-or-less a WYSIWYG editor, and the state is stored in the URL, so you don't have to worry about keeping track of where you stored your copy - if you've sent someone an email with the link, you've got a copy. This project was born out of the frustration of trying to generate an invoice on my phone on the go, I found all the existing solutions to be quite awful (forced signups to paid subscriptions, clunky interface etc).<p>Would love to hear any feedback the HN crowd has. I'm aware of a couple of alignment issues, will fix them up tonight. Also, yes, there will be a \"generate PDF\" button, for now if you want a pdf I'd suggest using the Print dialog to \"Save as PDF\".<p><a href=\"https://bestfreeinvoice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bestfreeinvoice.com</a></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43528885&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343528885\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

There have been times when I have been out riding, hiking or whatever and accidentally end the activity on my apple watch instead of pausing it. Starting a new workout means having your stats split across the two workouts.<p>The \"usual\" way to merge such workouts is to export all of them to individual FIT files, then use a tool like fitfiletools.com to merge the individual FIT files. You then have a merged FIT file, which is difficult to import back into Apple Health. This process also requires access to the internet, which is not always guaranteed when out in remote areas.<p>MergeFit makes this process easy by merging workouts right on device and without the need to deal with FIT files at all. It reads data directly from Apple Health and writes the merged data back to Apple Health.<p>The app reached a small milestone a few days ago - crossing 1000$ in total sales.</p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43531576&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343531576\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Will assemble and test over the next few weeks, then document properly. I got the matte black PCBs, they look really cool.<p>A hardware quantum RNG. Made a mistake in the board power supply, but it still works well with cut trace and a bodge wire. Will probably fix the bug and put the results up in a few weeks. Can push out ~300 bytes of entropy a second, each as an MQTT message.<p>A hardware device that just does E2E encrypted chat (using Curve 25519). Microcontrollers only, no OS, and nothing ever stored locally. HDMI output (1024x768), Wi-Fi, and USB keyboard support. I originally designed it to use a vanilla MQTT broker, but I'm probably going to move it to HTTP and just write a little self-hosted HTTP service that handles message routing and ephemeral key registration. Right now the encryption, video output, and USB host works -- but it was a tangle of wires to fix the initial bugs, so I ordered new boards. Got to put those through testing, then move on to writing the server.<p>Iterating on hardware stuff is pretty slow. I try to test more than one bugfix in parallel on the same board. Iteration time is 2-3 weeks and 8$. If I have all the parts in stock. I don't have very much free time right now due to work, so this suits me fine. A rule I live by is that I must always be creating, so I think this is a reasonable compromise.</p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43531488&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343531488\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Includes WireGuard overlay network, ingress with automatic HTTPS, and simple Docker-like CLI. Unlike traditional orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Uncloud has no state reconciliation or quorum needs which makes it easy to understand and use. If you ever wanted something simpler than Kubernetes for self-hosting your apps on cloud VMs or in your homelab, Uncloud might be for you.<p>Key updates from the past month:<p>- New demo screencast [2]: Deploy a highly available web app with automatic HTTPS across cloud VMs and on-premises in just a couple minutes<p>- Added initial Docker Compose support for service deployment. The same Compose can be used for developing locally and deploying to your cluster<p>- Completely revamped how service and container specifications are stored, enabling proper implementation of the service 'scale' command and selective container recreation<p>My goal for Uncloud is to create a more capable and modern replacement for Docker Swarm, which is no longer being actively developed.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud?tab=readme-ov-file#-qu...</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43532432&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343532432\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

This goal is my life quest, my life's work.<p>I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new <i>kinds</i> of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... <i>as well as</i> the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs.<p>The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily.<p>I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system.<p>[1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: <a href=\"https://www.mxjn.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mxjn.me</a><p>[2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree.

If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want.<p>This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card.<p>All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build.<p>I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell.<p>It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client.<p>Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want.<p>Want to play from the CLI, sure</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43528428&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343528428\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

My next goal is to get into CNC machining with metal and actually build a modern 16mm film camera.<p>For my day job I am currently working for an online education company. I have been learning about the concepts behind knowledge tracing and using knowledge components to get a fine grained perspective on what types of skills someone has acquired throughout their learning path. It is hard because our company hasn't really had any sort of basis to start from, so I have been reading a lot of research papers and trying to understand, from sort of first principles, how to approach this problem.

It's felt really good to build something useful, though.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://mentions.us\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mentions.us</a></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43527768&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343527768\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Think of it as \"SMTP Server to Anything.\"<p>One of the cool parts is MailTrigger supports WebAssembly (WASM), so you can customize your own notification logic and automate workflows. I’ve used it for tasks like monitoring internal systems, forwarding alerts to different chat platforms, and even adding basic decision-making logic before sending notifications. It’s been a huge time saver.<p>I’ve also experimented with using LLMs to assist in rule creation — you can configure notification rules using natural language instead of writing manual code. It’s like giving your infrastructure a smarter way to handle incidents.<p>At my company, I’m using MailTrigger for real-time price drop alerts and server health monitoring, along with integrations like Jenkins and Sentry to forward alerts to our DevOps Telegram channel.<p>It’s still super early, and things like the docs, pricing, and overall user experience are definitely a work in progress.

After its done finding all the people you want to communicate with, it suggests a ton of people you dont.<p>I actually find this to be similar to netflix and spotify suggestions, both of which were able to find things I wanted to consume early on, but now just give me waves of shit.<p>Consider doing something a lot smaller, like an opt in, 1 month activation at a time, depth 1 search to find people you might want to connect with, but without the hassle of having to swap details on another platform.</p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43529046&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343529046\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

It's designed to measure how altitude, temperature, and much more affect photosynthesis, and in turn, chlorophyll fluorescence in algae. We learned a while back that when you shine blue light on chlorophyll, it fluoresces red, and it's really quite a cool phenomena. We're designing custom PCBs for powering and processing data, and even. It'll all go to a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W which will beam data back to earth over 915Mhz LoRa when it's 100k feet in the sky.</div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43529962&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343529962\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

It's designed to make low level computing more accessible for modern students by making things as visual as possible, for example blinken-lighten for the registers like w/ the old PDPs, color coded memory that shows where the code and data segments are, where the stack is, etc, and a small frame buffer that drives a 64x64 2 bit display that uses the same color palette as the original gameboy.  The instruction set is a mashup of MIPS, the Scott CPU and JVM/forth stack operations.  I'm excited about it.<p>here's a screenshot:<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1cg/e99206f5d7b7b68ebcc8b813d54a0d38\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/1cg/e99206f5d7b7b68ebcc8b813d54a0d38</a></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43527617&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43527452%2343527617\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

          "text": "<div class=\"commtext c00\">If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection.<p>You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the \"Router\" field, that's how it works.<p>Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process.<p>As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work.<p>It's a fairly clever setup.<p>If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works.</p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43490074&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43470337%2343490074\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

          "text": "<div class=\"commtext c00\">This is almost certainly the answer and clever as hell. You just have to make sure the server storing the firmware (which you control) has the right CORS headers (as you mention) and you are in business.<p>This means that the CarPlay device has no \"internet\" (spoiler: it never had real internet access) unless you are on that page interacting with it.<p>I'm not sure how these devices work, I mean I know they broadcast themselves as a CarPlay head unit then \"somehow\" pass that to the car via a wired connection (pretending to be a phone connecting via USB). \"somehow\" being the important part. Does it hand along an encrypted stream that it can't decode or does it decode/re-encode?<p>Either way I'd bet these devices are pretty safe to use. The phone sends a video feed, not raw \"data\" so the MitM (again, if that's how it works) would need to OCR the video to get anything useful since the raw video would be too large to store and too heavy to transfer over cellular (via it's own hidden radio, again, worst-case-scenario).<p>If the device decodes the stream in the middle then the worst case I can think of is it could be doing on-device OCR and cellular radio to exfiltrate the text but I feel confident that you could spot the cellular radio (or someone who did a teardown). Without the radio it has no way to get data off the device which means the best it could do it sneak some out while you were on that update screen. Though I think that's all pretty far-fetched.<p>EDIT: I went looking for some way to act as a CarPlay receiver and get the raw video feed and it looks like it's possible [0] so yeah, a malicious device could proxy the connect, OCR the result, and send data via its own cellular connection but that would be relatively easy to detect and not worth it unless you are the target of a nation state which, at that point, you have bigger problems.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/harrylepotter/carplay-receiver\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/harrylepotter/carplay-receiver</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43510405&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43470337%2343510405\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

If I'm going to connect my phone to my car wirelessly for that, it's gonna drain the battery.  So I'm going to plug it in so it can charge.  So... now it's wired, so why do I need wireless?<p>I guess if you have a wireless charging pad in your car, then that's a <i>little</i> bit more convenient.  But the big inconvenience for me is just to have to take it out of my pocket in the first place, not to plug it into the car.  (And my car <i>does</i> have wireless charging, but my phone rarely seems to sit on it stably enough for it to charge all that well.)<p>To get fully back on topic: sure, a wireless dongle could exfil data, but unclear <i>what</i> data is all that valuable.  The car (and thus the dongle) just gets video and audio streams, not the actual textual content of your text messages, for example.  Sure, it could try to OCR the video and/or do voice recognition on the audio, but those are fairly computationally expensive.  And sending all that video to a remote server would be... a lot.</p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43512279&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43470337%2343512279\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Doesn't like pairing to multiple phones, and the phone doesn't like being plugged into one of the car's USB outlets (it drops the audio because AFAICT the phone thinks it's plugged into the car for audio, but the car is still expecting audio over the Bluetooth \"CarPlay\" connection), even if it's one of the outlets that's not supposed to do anything but power.<p>I'd use it a little differently, but it's my wife's car, not mine. Who would have thought a 2022 Mercedes would have wired-only CarPlay?<p>Anyway, I find it excellent for podcast control. If maps are off (in my case, because location services are turned off) it doesn't really use more power than plain Bluetooth audio, and when I approach my destination on a trip I'll turn on location and plug it in to juice up the last bit.</p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43515736&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43470337%2343515736\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Nothing more.<p>Batteries will only last for about two hours when they're not new, and you have the docs on your machine without distractions online. This forces you to work only on what you're working on, and do it fast as the battery is discharging so you catch yourself more often \"drifting\" in your thoughts, and you'll get better at catching yourself and focusing again, because \"Quick! It's discharging!\"<p>I know it sounds silly as you can just connect to the internet or plug your charger, but it really works.

Although the other 50% of the time it will give me some BS hacky answers or just make something up – especially when I'm using less common libraries.<p>Where I have got much lazier is when it comes to writing BS code like regexs, etc. It's not that I can't write them, I just know that it will take me longer to think about and create the regex than explaining to an LLM what I want to match on. But you still need to know regex to review it so I don't feel like losing any skills, just able to work faster in some cases like how pulling a email regex from SO would have help you code a solution faster a decade a go.</p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43509799&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43504073%2343509799\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

The context helps me get into the mindset of what I'm doing, and has helped me be productive.<p>This fails when people expect rote memorization like in coding interviews, but it works well when I'm actually working through problems in a company - I have a set of references up and available, usually of the internal codebase. I use AI as an advanced reference primarily so I haven't had the problem as stated here yet!<p>I think a lot of folks are finding that via AI they're switching over to the way that I do code, without the benefits of internal thinking structure I've had to come up with over time to manage it. I try to think of whatever I'm doing in a sort of scaffold, and then change my focus into the details. If you lose your ability to zoom in or out on layers of abstraction (because you don't understand whats happening in detail), that's when you need to spend time diving in.<p>You can't just sit back all the time like a farmer who's got a machine to plow and tend to all the fields, you need to be doing QA and making sure its doing what it says its doing. If you're letting it handle what the scaffold is, you know even less.<p>You decide which if any mental models you outsource to AI. You decide what you manage, and whats important for you to manage.

If your ecosystem supports HTTP and strings, you should be good to go.</p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43491422&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43486496%2343491422\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

The RAID array is just for redundancy so that a disk can fail and the data is still available from the other disk.<p>On this file server I am running Debian12 with Docker Compose. Then I built a management dashboard in TypeScript/Node that provides web servers you can spin up in about 2seconds and each server provides Websockets and http with fully proxy support over a single port. The dashboard also provides a command terminal via browser interface and a bunch of other server and connection management tools.<p>* I also included Samba for remote file system access from Windows with permission management.<p>* I run Jellyfin with metadata caching so that I can stream video without need for internet access or subscriptions.<p>* I run Pihole for DNS management.<p>* I just got WireGuard set up so now I can VPN directly into the home network from anywhere in the world via IPv6.<p>Therefore I don’t need a cloud storage subscription.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43519011&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43518404%2343519011\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

I have had interviews in the past that treated me like a child asking basic code literacy questions.  These kinds of interviews aren't helpful to anybody.<p>Instead the way to get past this foolishness is to ask open-ended questions expecting precise answers where the questions are themselves not precise.  This presents too much variance.  For example: <i>Talk to me about the methods of your favorite Node code library.</i>  In that case the candidate has to pick, on the fly, from any of the libraries that ship with Node and immediately start talking about what like about certain methods and how they would use them.<p>Another example: <i>Tell me about full duplex communication on the web.</i>  AI will immediately point you to WebSockets, but it won't explain what full duplex means in 3 words or less or why WebSockets are full duplex and other solutions aren't.<p>Another example: <i>Given a single page application what things would you recommend to get full state restoration within half a second of page request?</i>  AI barfs on that one.  It starts explain what state restoration is, which doesn't answer the question.<p>In other words AI is not a problem so long as you don't suck as an interviewer.</p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43500522&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343500522\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

The candidate reads out the first sentence. By this time I'd have already established that the candidate is not genuine. Our interview process let's ride out the interview as a courtesy and to also try to extract something out of the candidate that the company could use.<p>Anyway once they read out the first sentence from the AI with utmost sincerity, I'd follow-up with deeper questions into the topic at hand. 99% failed to answer the second question well. The ones who let me ask the third and fourth questions are devs who still have their original thinking hats in place but just use AI out of nervousness or who generally don't interview well. Those we'd explore further and suggest for lesser roles/alternate streams etc. This all my experience and others MMV.</p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43502133&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343502133\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

But, yes, performance is something users universally care very much about even if many businesses aren't willing to accept that, so the question remains highly relevant.  Another way a good interviewer, who has a background in performance, to consider this is to start asking performance questions that a candidate could answer from AI and the asking the candidate why some performance techniques work better than others and by how much.  Then you can really see if they have a high confidence AI answer that they cannot quality.<p>At any point, AI answers aren't a challenge for people who are confidence enough in the craft to ask more qualified questions and determine honesty from the resulting nonverbal signals.</p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43508860&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343508860\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Creator of stealthinterview.ai here.<p>After working for 15 years at FAANG, startups and no-name companies, I have conducted more than a 100 interviews for all levels, mostly in engineering.<p>In my experience with technical interviews specifically, there are 4 types of candidates:<p>- the memorizer\n- the mathematical brain\n- the project builder\n- the coding enthusiast that knows a language well but can’t do algorithms<p>Most of the time, I have encountered candidates in buckets 3 and 4. Many showed debugging skills, communication skills, but lacked the right answer to trapping rainwater.<p>I was told to reject candidates who couldn’t pass these problems mainly on the grounds of solved or not solved, even if they clearly communicated.<p>The only reason I got into FAANG companies myself is because I was the good memorizer. I couldn’t solve most of these problems today without months of prep.<p>At the end, I left my FAANG job recently because I realized it’s going to be the same or worse at any other company, because internally it’s all the same B.S. once you make it in. Sure, you’ll get a fat salary, but it’s a slow grind.<p>Instead, I chose to build things.<p>Is the interview process today bad? I think so.<p>What can candidates do about it? Take it in their own hands and play the game or get played.<p>What is the alternative? Depends. There are many companies that don’t do crazy algorithm interviews and pay really well. In my opinion, if you are hiring hundreds of engineers per year, take-home assessments and reviewing them is literally a job on its own. Making candidates build apps from scratch and deploy it, test it, present it? Maybe, but certainly opinionated, not binary.<p>New grads don’t have experience, but experienced engineers do. You shouldn’t need to ask people with 10 years of experience about trapping rainwater from LC. There are so many other things to ask, discuss, and gauge experience, scope and depth.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43512722&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343512722\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

Obviously it's a problem if someone just googles for a solution and pastes it in.<p>I see LLMs in the same way. No issue with them using it do something like take the pseudo code they wrote in front of me and turned it into an implementation. Especially if they could talk through this code and make suggestions about further changes and so on, clearly showing they understand what's going on.<p>The real concern is going to be when sophisticated agents can impersonate (clone voice and video) in a convincing way, as well as the capabilities to see the screen and type away as if it was a real person, and they're responding to you in real time.<p>If the software is based on the models made by large companies, they'll be happy to give you recipes. They would refuse if the coding request mentioned something about cracking passwords or dumping credit cards. And all of them will have a meltdown if you try to ask them to say something politically incorrect (what a bizarre world that would be if that became the new captcha system for humans trying to figure out if they're wasting their time with a fake human).<p>That said, this is going to be a cat and mouse game. There will be nothing to stop people from fine tuning models to get around being \"jailbreaked\" to reveal themselves as LLMs. Perhaps the best means is taking the time to research problems that causes \"vibe coding\" to completely fall down. And that is likely going to be things that are novel and haven't been littered all over the internet. That has a knock on effect of making such interviews a bit more interesting for the people doing them too.</p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43502758&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343502758\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

If it's solvable with a few functions within 1 hour, AI will solve it in 5 minutes.<p>If the job is cutting trees, you can't measure them by how long they take to cut a tree, but whether they have stamina to cut through multiple trees.<p>Take home assignments work, and the good news is they can be shorter now. 1 day or 4 hours of work is enough of a benchmark. Something like a Wordle clone is about the right level of complexity.<p>Things we look for:<p>1. Do they use a library? Some people are a bit egoistic about doing things the easy way. GenAI will make a list of words, which is both wasteful and incomplete when they can find a dictionary of words. Do they cut down the dictionary to the right size? It should only be the words not definitions.<p>2. Architecture? What do they normally use? How do the parts link to one another? How do they handle errors?<p>3. Do they bring in something new? AI will usually use a 5 year old tech stack unless you give it a specific one, because that's around the average of code it's trained on. If they're experienced enough to tell AI to use the new tech, they're probably experienced enough.<p>4. Require a starting commit (probably gitignore) and ask them to add reasonable sized commits. Classic coding should look a bit like painting. Vibe coding looks like sculpting, where you chip bits off. This will also catch more critical cheating, like someone else doing the work on their behalf - the commits may be from the wrong emails or you'll see massive commits where nothing gets chipped off.<p>5. There are going to be people who think AI is a nuisance. Tests like this will help you benchmark the different factions. But don't give them so much toil that it puts the AI users at a large advantage and don't give overly complex \"solved\" questions that the AI can just pull out from training.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43501175&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343501175\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

People call it MVVM, Bloc, MVP, etc. But we want to see the pattern of UI-repo-service and unidirectional data flow. This is three layers and it can be as little as 3 files. If someone can grasp that, it's good enough.<p>There's not a lot of ways you can screw up hiring mobile devs; most skills are trainable. But this is what costs months. One guy once looped the viewmodel inside another viewmodel because he was using them as the data store and observable. He was let go but it took 2 years to remove everything he did from production even though he worked there for 3 months and most of it was via rewriting entire blocks of code.<p>We watch for overengineering and perfectionism. Some people insist on more blocks or splitting it into modules. But can they do that in 4 hours?<p>AI can write all of it easy enough, but it's just a 2-3x multiplier. Some assume it's an infinite multiplier and they can just subscribe to Cursor on the spot and it'll be done in a blink. But do the parts connect in the order given above?<p>Also Wordle is not ideal for architecture, but it's good enough. It requires a solid understanding of the top level of things, and connection to the data layer. What if we switched the word source from the dictionary to the API? That's a bit more of an advanced test.<p>An even more advanced test would be structuring it for TDD, which would need understanding of DI, factories, tests and gotchas, etc. I don't think this is doable even with AI yet though.<p>As a UI test, Wordle is pretty good because you have all your logic and variables on one layer and display it via a different, more complex layer.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43529061&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43499473%2343529061\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

          "text": "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Just want to chime in on indie open source: I'm seeing many projects from chinese coders on Github since ~2022, I've come across some useful tools, mostly in the LLM space like OpenManus or Cherry Studio, but also documents like Siyuan, Univer. They seem pretty popular, even though many insist on inflating the stars at the beginning, for the initial boost on popularity.<p>Then there are the corporate-backed efforts from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei which are sometimes published here and make the news, several frameworks and engines.<p>Some projects only have a read-only mirror on Github, because all the work is done on their local alternatives like Gitee, or scattered around other places.<p>And well, anywhere you go a lot of software is disposable; integrations, widgets, things tailored to the local market, and so on... so that's probably why we don't see as much. I mean, it pales in comparison to the amount of culturally impactful software made back in the 80s and 90s, both in Europe and the US. But all things considered, I think they are catching up, and the traditional language barrier is breaking down, as in, I'm seeing more collaboration out in the open.</p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43519657&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43518008%2343519657\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

          "text": "<div class=\"commtext c00\">We in exUSSR asked similar question - we have huge number of engineers, but don't see huge industrial export, only agricultural now.<p>Answer found in economy works of Adam Smith and modern - Daron Acemoğlu, James A. Robinson.<p>Answer is simple and named information inequality.<p>What it mean - professional know magnitudes more than customer, and customer just don't know 99% of what exist on market, or even more.<p>To solve problem of information inequality appear middleman, usually in form of entrepreneur, who know customer needs and know what could do professionals, and invest in products (or in services).<p>Problem is that entrepreneur must have computer education, and at same time be old enough to talk with all people.<p>In China was so pure people before 2000s, they just don't know computers at all. After middle 2000s China become much richer, they even got about 60 millions more or less similar to middle class of Europe, from which about 7m programmers.<p>What all these means? Few things.<p>First - Chinese programmers are now busy in just filling emptiness, as they are culturally so different from West, that many Western soft is not fit, so Chinese  programmers need to make their local clones, and they now repeat steps, Western programmers made in 1950s..2000s, so 50 years. Oh, sorry, really computer revolution at West happen in late 1970s, with microcomputers, but anyway, at West we have programmers nearly all ages from school to about 80years old (2020-1980+30..40), but in China, most just about 40 years at most (2020-2005+20).<p>Second - Chinese programmers don't have enough entrepreneurs, so they cannot got contact with clients, this is like huge concrete wall.<p>Third, really First - Chinese population older than about 40 years, just don't have any feelings to computers. Believe me, I know lot of people for which virtual world is just don't exists, so Chinese programmers just don't have any feedback from their population, and so they cannot use their home country as foundation to grow. This is so serious obstacle, which just made literally impossible creation of something really interesting but not tied to huge corporation, and China don't have startup ecosystem, because it need decades to grow.<p>So from all these points for me obvious, we could only see from China only big corporation products with Chinese specifics, and all known examples show this: few games, clone of internet search engine, clone of linux and lot of nearly unknown embedded software in Chinese products.<p>In about 20 years things could change, if China will open culturally to West, but now they filling gap.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43527711&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43518008%2343527711\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",

This is only useful if you are not behind CG-NAT otherwise a VPN would have to be established from the home to a VM somewhere and then use that VM as the entry-point.  Your extended family members could also have a browser open watching what is going on in your home.<p>That ZoneMinder or other open source NVM would double as home security so you could also watch all the doors, windows, yards, driveway, garage, etc...  Each NVM will have a webpage that lists the compatible cameras.<p>I assume you mean to watch the baby while a babysitter is there and the baby is not truly alone.  There are also some NannyCam devices that hide the camera so you can also keep an eye on what the babysitter is doing with the baby in multiple rooms.<p>None of this addresses E2EE but the server would be hosted in your house and would be using TLS to your web browser to watch it.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https://zoneminder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zoneminder.com/</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us20t1gQPOE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us20t1gQPOE</a></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"reply\"> <p><font size=\"1\">\n<u><a href=\"reply?id=43509409&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43509332%2343509409\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n</font>\n</p></div>",
