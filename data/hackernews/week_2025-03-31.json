In short, at the core of Tangled is what we call “knots”; they’re lightweight, headless servers that serve up your git repository, and the contents viewed and collaborated upon via the “app view” at tangled.sh. All social data (issues, comments, PRs, other repo metadata) is stored “on-proto”—in your AT Protocol PDS. We don’t just plan to reimplement GitHub, but rethink and improve on the status quo. For instance, we plan to make stacked PRs and stacked diff-based reviews first-class citizens of the platform. Right now, our pull request feature is rather simplistic but very useful still: you paste your git diff output, and “resubmit” for a new round of review (if necessary). You can see an example here: https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core/pulls/14 We’re fully open source: https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core and are actively building. Come check it out! reply",

It's more-or-less a WYSIWYG editor, and the state is stored in the URL, so you don't have to worry about keeping track of where you stored your copy - if you've sent someone an email with the link, you've got a copy. This project was born out of the frustration of trying to generate an invoice on my phone on the go, I found all the existing solutions to be quite awful (forced signups to paid subscriptions, clunky interface etc). Would love to hear any feedback the HN crowd has. I'm aware of a couple of alignment issues, will fix them up tonight. Also, yes, there will be a \"generate PDF\" button, for now if you want a pdf I'd suggest using the Print dialog to \"Save as PDF\". https://bestfreeinvoice.com reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. For developers: your books are just a database. \nChoosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own bookkeeping software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. reply",

Key parts: - Created EDANSA [1], the first public dataset of its kind from these areas, using a improved active learning method (ensemble disagreement) to efficiently find rare sounds. - Explored other low-resource ML: transfer learning, data valuation (using Shapley values), cross-modal learning (using satellite weather data to train audio models), and testing the reasoning abilities of MLLMs on audio (spoiler: they struggle!). Happy to discuss any part! [1] https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AH-sLEkAAAAJ&hl=en reply",

          "text": "I'm currently trying to transition from a fairly rigid day job into working as an independent developer. The goal is to build useful online tools and hopefully create a sustainable income stream doing something I find more engaging. One consistent annoyance in my professional work has been dealing with PDFs – specifically, extracting information into editable formats without losing structure. Copy-pasting often creates a mess. So, my first project tackling this is an online PDF to Markdown converter: https://pdftomarkdown.pro/ I've focused heavily on trying to maintain good formatting for headings, text flow, formulas, and especially table structure (getting rows/columns right in Markdown). It also has an online editor for quick modifications after conversion. A key aspect for me was privacy: the application explicitly does not save the content of uploaded PDFs or the generated Markdown files. It only stores minimal metadata (email, filename, page count) for registered users' plan limits. It's very much a \"scratching my own itch\" project born out of that PDF frustration. Early days, but hoping it proves useful for others too. reply",

          "text": "I’m working on https://pikku.dev It’s a TypeScript web framework that’s runtime agnostic, so it can work on serverless and servers (similar to Hono). What’s different is that the focus is primarily just on TypeScript. There’s a CLI tool that inspects all the project code and generates loads of metadata. This can include: • services used • all the HTTP routes, inputs and outputs • OpenAPI documentation • schemas to validate against • typed fetch client • typed WebSocket client\n(and more) The design decision was also to make it follow a function-based approach, which means your product code is just functions (that get given all the services required). And you have controllers that wire them up to different transport protocols. This allows interesting design concepts, like writing WebSocket code via serverless format, while allowing it to be deployed via a single process or distributed/serverless. Or progressive enhancement, allowing backend functions to work as HTTP, but also work via Server-Sent Events if a stream is provided. It also allows functions to be called directly from Next.js and full-stack development frameworks without needing to run on a separate server or use their API endpoints (not a huge advocate, but it helps a lot with SSR). Gave a talk about that last week at the Node.js meetup in Berlin. It’s still not 1.0 and there are breaking changes while I include more use cases. Upcoming changes: • use Request and Response objects to make it truly runtime agnostic (currently each adapter has its own thin layer, which tbf is still needed by many that don’t adopt the web spec) • smarter code splitting (this will reduce bundle size by tree-shaking anything not needed on a per-function basis) • queues (one more form of transport) Check it out, would love feedback! reply",

Will assemble and test over the next few weeks, then document properly. I got the matte black PCBs, they look really cool. A hardware quantum RNG. Made a mistake in the board power supply, but it still works well with cut trace and a bodge wire. Will probably fix the bug and put the results up in a few weeks. Can push out ~300 bytes of entropy a second, each as an MQTT message. A hardware device that just does E2E encrypted chat (using Curve 25519). Microcontrollers only, no OS, and nothing ever stored locally. HDMI output (1024x768), Wi-Fi, and USB keyboard support. I originally designed it to use a vanilla MQTT broker, but I'm probably going to move it to HTTP and just write a little self-hosted HTTP service that handles message routing and ephemeral key registration. Right now the encryption, video output, and USB host works -- but it was a tangle of wires to fix the initial bugs, so I ordered new boards. Got to put those through testing, then move on to writing the server. Iterating on hardware stuff is pretty slow. I try to test more than one bugfix in parallel on the same board. Iteration time is 2-3 weeks and 8$. If I have all the parts in stock. I don't have very much free time right now due to work, so this suits me fine. A rule I live by is that I must always be creating, so I think this is a reasonable compromise. reply",

I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system. [1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me [2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree. So no VR, no video-tracked physical miniatures, no custom-designed tabletop, no Microsoft Surface... Again, just my opinion. reply",

          "text": "I released an iOS app last October for users who use Apple Watch to record their workouts - https://mergefit.itwenty.me It lets users merge two or more workouts into a single one. There have been times when I have been out riding, hiking or whatever and accidentally end the activity on my apple watch instead of pausing it. Starting a new workout means having your stats split across the two workouts. The \"usual\" way to merge such workouts is to export all of them to individual FIT files, then use a tool like fitfiletools.com to merge the individual FIT files. You then have a merged FIT file, which is difficult to import back into Apple Health. This process also requires access to the internet, which is not always guaranteed when out in remote areas. MergeFit makes this process easy by merging workouts right on device and without the need to deal with FIT files at all. It reads data directly from Apple Health and writes the merged data back to Apple Health. The app reached a small milestone a few days ago - crossing 1000$ in total sales. reply",

My most demanding use case is multi-user expense tracking. Legal/financial document (a la google drive), family photo tracking (a la google photos) is also up there.

          "text": "Some time ago, I began searching for Python-related events and discovered that many PUGs (local Python User Groups) had disappeared sometime around COVID (at least my local PUGs). After analyzing the ones listed on the official Python website, I found only about 18% were still active, with most hosted on Meetup. This makes sense, as maintaining a community requires time and money, which small PUGs don't have.  Meetup can be costly for those starting local Python User Groups, but it's very cheap for big communities. IMO Meetup is not the best place for PUGs, as they are not big by default. PUGs need a way to communicate and broadcast, to be discovered, but it doesn't necessarily need all of Meetup's features. Also, PUGs probably don't want to be tied to Facebook or other social media platforms. It'd be best if they allowed a simple ownership transfer, once you get tired of organizing. That's why I created https://pythonuser.group/ - a lightweight side project that, despite being rough around the edges, fulfills the core need: allowing people to discover PUGs worldwide for free. The platform costs me almost nothing to maintain. Allows to subscribe to local PUGs via RSS (not sure if it works). I'll add \"export all my PUG data\" once someone requests this feature. It's the first time I share it with the world. Please don't treat it as prod-ready. Feedback welcome at hn@{username}.com reply",

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "https://aponlink.com/ I built a no-AI, human-only social network focused on ONLY one thing - keeping people connected. I'd stepped away from mainstream social media last year due to the overwhelming negativity, privacy violation, etc. Then around early this year, I started to feel I was missing updates from people who actually matter in my life. Instead of going back to traditional platforms, I decided to create a simple solution myself. The platform emphasizes:\n- No AI algorithms or content manipulation\n- No infinite scrolling designed to trap your attention\n- A simple interface for sharing life updates with close connections (Text and Photos only for now) We've intentionally made connecting difficult: no user search and no friend suggestions - you only connect with people you already know and care about. Web: https://aponlink.com/ Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aponlink.a... (iOS version coming soon) I'd love to hear how this approach resonates with the HN community, particularly from those who've also grown tired of traditional social media. reply",

The issue is that the social graph overstays its welcome. After its done finding all the people you want to communicate with, it suggests a ton of people you dont. I actually find this to be similar to netflix and spotify suggestions, both of which were able to find things I wanted to consume early on, but now just give me waves of shit. Consider doing something a lot smaller, like an opt in, 1 month activation at a time, depth 1 search to find people you might want to connect with, but without the hassle of having to swap details on another platform. reply",

          "text": "That’s a great insight. I totally agree that early Facebook’s ability to surface actual connections was valuable before it turned into an endless recommendation machine. The challenge is figuring out how to offer just enough discoverability that doesn't creep users. I like your idea of an opt-in, time-limited, depth-1 search, it keeps things intentional while reducing friction. Definitely something to think about.

          "text": "I'm working on MailTrigger — a customizable SMTP server that turns any email notification into a message on platforms like LINE, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, SMS, or pretty much anything else. The idea is simple: if your app can send an email, it can trigger notifications across multiple channels with no extra coding. Think of it as \"SMTP Server to Anything.\" One of the cool parts is MailTrigger supports WebAssembly (WASM), so you can customize your own notification logic and automate workflows. I’ve used it for tasks like monitoring internal systems, forwarding alerts to different chat platforms, and even adding basic decision-making logic before sending notifications. It’s been a huge time saver. I’ve also experimented with using LLMs to assist in rule creation — you can configure notification rules using natural language instead of writing manual code. It’s like giving your infrastructure a smarter way to handle incidents. At my company, I’m using MailTrigger for real-time price drop alerts and server health monitoring, along with integrations like Jenkins and Sentry to forward alerts to our DevOps Telegram channel. It’s still super early, and things like the docs, pricing, and overall user experience are definitely a work in progress. But I’m iterating quickly and would love to hear feedback from this community! Check it out here: https://mailtrigger.app/ Curious to hear your thoughts! reply",

My network cupboard is a mess, and I've been slowly CADing and test-printing parts for a 8.5 inch server rack system. I've managed to get some nice side rails, and I'm currently doing some test prints for a mount for a Lenovo M700 computer, which I like for lightweight server stuff (the one I have is currently running my homeassistant and a couple of other docker things, and I'm going to be buying another to use as a NAS). I'm also slowly working on rewriting my website backend to pull projects off external drives, reformat them into blog pages and automatically update my website to use them. Currently I'm still at the early testing stage, and I have quite a way to go, but the basic parts are there. The 8.5 inch racking system was inspired by Jeff Geerling's video about 10 inch rack, but shrunk even further to allow me to fit it on my 3D printer bed (8.6 inch square). I currently have parts for the top and bottom of the rack, as well as 1U and 2U expansions that you can slot together to make the rack as tall as you want. I'm also thinking about making a side attachment system so you can clip fans onto the side or similar. Once I have a working rack with several units in it, I'll probably end up publishing the parts and a writeup about it reply",

If you ever wanted something simpler than Kubernetes for self-hosting your apps on cloud VMs or in your homelab, Uncloud might be for you. Key updates from the past month: - New demo screencast [2]: Deploy a highly available web app with automatic HTTPS across cloud VMs and on-premises in just a couple minutes - Added initial Docker Compose support for service deployment. The same Compose can be used for developing locally and deploying to your cluster - Completely revamped how service and container specifications are stored, enabling proper implementation of the service 'scale' command and selective container recreation My goal for Uncloud is to create a more capable and modern replacement for Docker Swarm, which is no longer being actively developed.

          "text": "If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection. You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the \"Router\" field, that's how it works. Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process. As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work. It's a fairly clever setup. If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works. reply",

          "text": "This is almost certainly the answer and clever as hell. You just have to make sure the server storing the firmware (which you control) has the right CORS headers (as you mention) and you are in business. This means that the CarPlay device has no \"internet\" (spoiler: it never had real internet access) unless you are on that page interacting with it. I'm not sure how these devices work, I mean I know they broadcast themselves as a CarPlay head unit then \"somehow\" pass that to the car via a wired connection (pretending to be a phone connecting via USB). \"somehow\" being the important part. Does it hand along an encrypted stream that it can't decode or does it decode/re-encode? Either way I'd bet these devices are pretty safe to use. The phone sends a video feed, not raw \"data\" so the MitM (again, if that's how it works) would need to OCR the video to get anything useful since the raw video would be too large to store and too heavy to transfer over cellular (via it's own hidden radio, again, worst-case-scenario). If the device decodes the stream in the middle then the worst case I can think of is it could be doing on-device OCR and cellular radio to exfiltrate the text but I feel confident that you could spot the cellular radio (or someone who did a teardown). Without the radio it has no way to get data off the device which means the best it could do it sneak some out while you were on that update screen. Though I think that's all pretty far-fetched. EDIT: I went looking for some way to act as a CarPlay receiver and get the raw video feed and it looks like it's possible [0] so yeah, a malicious device could proxy the connect, OCR the result, and send data via its own cellular connection but that would be relatively easy to detect and not worth it unless you are the target of a nation state which, at that point, you have bigger problems.

I did get it to work connecting my PC to the dongle (which acts as a wifi access point). My PC then loaded the firmware in a desktop browser window as I was connected to Ethernet and the dongle at the same time. I may have had to set some up routes manually. They absolutely should not get Internet access through the phone. I really hope it doesn't work that way! I searched quite a bit but could not find a definitive answer. Edit: I read the other replies and it makes sense. The browser on your phone can make a request over wifi and over cellular, so really the browser would do the fetching over the internet, not the device. reply",

But the big inconvenience for me is just to have to take it out of my pocket in the first place, not to plug it into the car.  (And my car does have wireless charging, but my phone rarely seems to sit on it stably enough for it to charge all that well.) To get fully back on topic: sure, a wireless dongle could exfil data, but unclear what data is all that valuable.  The car (and thus the dongle) just gets video and audio streams, not the actual textual content of your text messages, for example.  Sure, it could try to OCR the video and/or do voice recognition on the audio, but those are fairly computationally expensive.  And sending all that video to a remote server would be... a lot. reply",

Doesn't like pairing to multiple phones, and the phone doesn't like being plugged into one of the car's USB outlets (it drops the audio because AFAICT the phone thinks it's plugged into the car for audio, but the car is still expecting audio over the Bluetooth \"CarPlay\" connection), even if it's one of the outlets that's not supposed to do anything but power. I'd use it a little differently, but it's my wife's car, not mine. Who would have thought a 2022 Mercedes would have wired-only CarPlay? Anyway, I find it excellent for podcast control. If maps are off (in my case, because location services are turned off) it doesn't really use more power than plain Bluetooth audio, and when I approach my destination on a trip I'll turn on location and plug it in to juice up the last bit. reply",

          "text": "One method that works really well is the following: - Unplug your laptop's charger - Disconnect from the internet - Work using only using your battery charge and the documentation on your laptop If you find that you need an information about something that's in a doc you don't have, only connect to the internet to download it, then disconnect. Nothing more. Batteries will only last for about two hours when they're not new, and you have the docs on your machine without distractions online. This forces you to work only on what you're working on, and do it fast as the battery is discharging so you catch yourself more often \"drifting\" in your thoughts, and you'll get better at catching yourself and focusing again, because \"Quick! It's discharging!\" I know it sounds silly as you can just connect to the internet or plug your charger, but it really works. Its real job is to remind you to focus and get things done. Try it, and you'll find soon enough just how much of your attention was scattered, but you'll be weaning as soon. reply",

Today about 50% of the time I can just ask AI if it knows what I need. Although the other 50% of the time it will give me some BS hacky answers or just make something up – especially when I'm using less common libraries. Where I have got much lazier is when it comes to writing BS code like regexs, etc. It's not that I can't write them, I just know that it will take me longer to think about and create the regex than explaining to an LLM what I want to match on. But you still need to know regex to review it so I don't feel like losing any skills, just able to work faster in some cases like how pulling a email regex from SO would have help you code a solution faster a decade a go. reply",

The context helps me get into the mindset of what I'm doing, and has helped me be productive. This fails when people expect rote memorization like in coding interviews, but it works well when I'm actually working through problems in a company - I have a set of references up and available, usually of the internal codebase. I use AI as an advanced reference primarily so I haven't had the problem as stated here yet! I think a lot of folks are finding that via AI they're switching over to the way that I do code, without the benefits of internal thinking structure I've had to come up with over time to manage it. I try to think of whatever I'm doing in a sort of scaffold, and then change my focus into the details. If you lose your ability to zoom in or out on layers of abstraction (because you don't understand whats happening in detail), that's when you need to spend time diving in. You can't just sit back all the time like a farmer who's got a machine to plow and tend to all the fields, you need to be doing QA and making sure its doing what it says its doing. If you're letting it handle what the scaffold is, you know even less. You decide which if any mental models you outsource to AI. You decide what you manage, and whats important for you to manage. Don't let short term productivity gains hobble your ability to zoom in! reply",

I added two 14tb disks in a RAID 1 array and they don’t even fit in the box physically. The RAID array is just for redundancy so that a disk can fail and the data is still available from the other disk. On this file server I am running Debian12 with Docker Compose. Then I built a management dashboard in TypeScript/Node that provides web servers you can spin up in about 2seconds and each server provides Websockets and http with fully proxy support over a single port. The dashboard also provides a command terminal via browser interface and a bunch of other server and connection management tools. * I also included Samba for remote file system access from Windows with permission management. * I run Jellyfin with metadata caching so that I can stream video without need for internet access or subscriptions. * I run Pihole for DNS management. * I just got WireGuard set up so now I can VPN directly into the home network from anywhere in the world via IPv6. Therefore I don’t need a cloud storage subscription. reply",

These kinds of interviews aren't helpful to anybody. Instead the way to get past this foolishness is to ask open-ended questions expecting precise answers where the questions are themselves not precise.  This presents too much variance.  For example: Talk to me about the methods of your favorite Node code library. In that case the candidate has to pick, on the fly, from any of the libraries that ship with Node and immediately start talking about what like about certain methods and how they would use them. Another example: Tell me about full duplex communication on the web. AI will immediately point you to WebSockets, but it won't explain what full duplex means in 3 words or less or why WebSockets are full duplex and other solutions aren't. Another example: Given a single page application what things would you recommend to get full state restoration within half a second of page request? AI barfs on that one.  It starts explain what state restoration is, which doesn't answer the question. In other words AI is not a problem so long as you don't suck as an interviewer. reply",

Our interview process let's ride out the interview as a courtesy and to also try to extract something out of the candidate that the company could use. Anyway once they read out the first sentence from the AI with utmost sincerity, I'd follow-up with deeper questions into the topic at hand. 99% failed to answer the second question well. The ones who let me ask the third and fourth questions are devs who still have their original thinking hats in place but just use AI out of nervousness or who generally don't interview well.

But, yes, performance is something users universally care very much about even if many businesses aren't willing to accept that, so the question remains highly relevant.  Another way a good interviewer, who has a background in performance, to consider this is to start asking performance questions that a candidate could answer from AI and the asking the candidate why some performance techniques work better than others and by how much.  Then you can really see if they have a high confidence AI answer that they cannot quality. At any point, AI answers aren't a challenge for people who are confidence enough in the craft to ask more qualified questions and determine honesty from the resulting nonverbal signals. reply",

          "text": "Hey! Creator of stealthinterview.ai here. After working for 15 years at FAANG, startups and no-name companies, I have conducted more than a 100 interviews for all levels, mostly in engineering. In my experience with technical interviews specifically, there are 4 types of candidates: - the memorizer\n- the mathematical brain\n- the project builder\n- the coding enthusiast that knows a language well but can’t do algorithms Most of the time, I have encountered candidates in buckets 3 and 4. Many showed debugging skills, communication skills, but lacked the right answer to trapping rainwater. I was told to reject candidates who couldn’t pass these problems mainly on the grounds of solved or not solved, even if they clearly communicated. The only reason I got into FAANG companies myself is because I was the good memorizer. I couldn’t solve most of these problems today without months of prep. At the end, I left my FAANG job recently because I realized it’s going to be the same or worse at any other company, because internally it’s all the same B.S. once you make it in. Sure, you’ll get a fat salary, but it’s a slow grind. Instead, I chose to build things. Is the interview process today bad? I think so. What can candidates do about it? Take it in their own hands and play the game or get played. What is the alternative? Depends. There are many companies that don’t do crazy algorithm interviews and pay really well. In my opinion, if you are hiring hundreds of engineers per year, take-home assessments and reviewing them is literally a job on its own. Making candidates build apps from scratch and deploy it, test it, present it? Maybe, but certainly opinionated, not binary. New grads don’t have experience, but experienced engineers do. You shouldn’t need to ask people with 10 years of experience about trapping rainwater from LC. There are so many other things to ask, discuss, and gauge experience, scope and depth. reply",

This is the same type of test as the takehome tests that a lot of companies give, where you can use google or stack overflow previously to do research. If I was hiring for my own project and needed people that can problem solve, I would be asking more involved questions that LLMs could not solve, because LLMS will give you just the standard most commonly used solution.

          "text": "I strongly believe technical interviews should try to mirror a pair programming session on a problem as if it was work, rather than a quiz or interrogation type format. If someone asked during such a session (where it's cameras, screenshare) that they wanted to do something like google some documentation, I wouldn't see that as a problem. Obviously it's a problem if someone just googles for a solution and pastes it in. I see LLMs in the same way. No issue with them using it do something like take the pseudo code they wrote in front of me and turned it into an implementation. Especially if they could talk through this code and make suggestions about further changes and so on, clearly showing they understand what's going on. The real concern is going to be when sophisticated agents can impersonate (clone voice and video) in a convincing way, as well as the capabilities to see the screen and type away as if it was a real person, and they're responding to you in real time. If the software is based on the models made by large companies, they'll be happy to give you recipes. They would refuse if the coding request mentioned something about cracking passwords or dumping credit cards. And all of them will have a meltdown if you try to ask them to say something politically incorrect (what a bizarre world that would be if that became the new captcha system for humans trying to figure out if they're wasting their time with a fake human). That said, this is going to be a cat and mouse game. There will be nothing to stop people from fine tuning models to get around being \"jailbreaked\" to reveal themselves as LLMs. Perhaps the best means is taking the time to research problems that causes \"vibe coding\" to completely fall down. And that is likely going to be things that are novel and haven't been littered all over the internet. That has a knock on effect of making such interviews a bit more interesting for the people doing them too. reply",

          "text": "Leetcode style questions no longer work. If it's solvable with a few functions within 1 hour, AI will solve it in 5 minutes. If the job is cutting trees, you can't measure them by how long they take to cut a tree, but whether they have stamina to cut through multiple trees. Take home assignments work, and the good news is they can be shorter now. 1 day or 4 hours of work is enough of a benchmark. Something like a Wordle clone is about the right level of complexity. Things we look for: 1. Do they use a library? Some people are a bit egoistic about doing things the easy way. GenAI will make a list of words, which is both wasteful and incomplete when they can find a dictionary of words. Do they cut down the dictionary to the right size? It should only be the words not definitions. 2. Architecture? What do they normally use? How do the parts link to one another? How do they handle errors? 3. Do they bring in something new? AI will usually use a 5 year old tech stack unless you give it a specific one, because that's around the average of code it's trained on. If they're experienced enough to tell AI to use the new tech, they're probably experienced enough. 4. Require a starting commit (probably gitignore) and ask them to add reasonable sized commits. Classic coding should look a bit like painting. Vibe coding looks like sculpting, where you chip bits off. This will also catch more critical cheating, like someone else doing the work on their behalf - the commits may be from the wrong emails or you'll see massive commits where nothing gets chipped off. 5. There are going to be people who think AI is a nuisance. Tests like this will help you benchmark the different factions. But don't give them so much toil that it puts the AI users at a large advantage and don't give overly complex \"solved\" questions that the AI can just pull out from training. reply",

          "text": "We basically look for this: https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide It's similar across all mobile platforms. People call it MVVM, Bloc, MVP, etc. But we want to see the pattern of UI-repo-service and unidirectional data flow. This is three layers and it can be as little as 3 files. If someone can grasp that, it's good enough. There's not a lot of ways you can screw up hiring mobile devs; most skills are trainable. But this is what costs months. One guy once looped the viewmodel inside another viewmodel because he was using them as the data store and observable. He was let go but it took 2 years to remove everything he did from production even though he worked there for 3 months and most of it was via rewriting entire blocks of code. We watch for overengineering and perfectionism. Some people insist on more blocks or splitting it into modules. But can they do that in 4 hours? AI can write all of it easy enough, but it's just a 2-3x multiplier. Some assume it's an infinite multiplier and they can just subscribe to Cursor on the spot and it'll be done in a blink. But do the parts connect in the order given above? Also Wordle is not ideal for architecture, but it's good enough. It requires a solid understanding of the top level of things, and connection to the data layer. What if we switched the word source from the dictionary to the API? That's a bit more of an advanced test. An even more advanced test would be structuring it for TDD, which would need understanding of DI, factories, tests and gotchas, etc. I don't think this is doable even with AI yet though. As a UI test, Wordle is pretty good because you have all your logic and variables on one layer and display it via a different, more complex layer. reply",

I decide the rules that I’m willing to break and don’t particularly care what other people are willing to break. I can’t control them. I can control me.

          "text": "Just want to chime in on indie open source: I'm seeing many projects from chinese coders on Github since ~2022, I've come across some useful tools, mostly in the LLM space like OpenManus or Cherry Studio, but also documents like Siyuan, Univer. They seem pretty popular, even though many insist on inflating the stars at the beginning, for the initial boost on popularity. Then there are the corporate-backed efforts from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei which are sometimes published here and make the news, several frameworks and engines. Some projects only have a read-only mirror on Github, because all the work is done on their local alternatives like Gitee, or scattered around other places. And well, anywhere you go a lot of software is disposable; integrations, widgets, things tailored to the local market, and so on... so that's probably why we don't see as much. I mean, it pales in comparison to the amount of culturally impactful software made back in the 80s and 90s, both in Europe and the US. But all things considered, I think they are catching up, and the traditional language barrier is breaking down, as in, I'm seeing more collaboration out in the open. reply",

          "text": "We in exUSSR asked similar question - we have huge number of engineers, but don't see huge industrial export, only agricultural now. Answer found in economy works of Adam Smith and modern - Daron Acemoğlu, James A. Robinson. Answer is simple and named information inequality. What it mean - professional know magnitudes more than customer, and customer just don't know 99% of what exist on market, or even more. To solve problem of information inequality appear middleman, usually in form of entrepreneur, who know customer needs and know what could do professionals, and invest in products (or in services). Problem is that entrepreneur must have computer education, and at same time be old enough to talk with all people. In China was so pure people before 2000s, they just don't know computers at all. After middle 2000s China become much richer, they even got about 60 millions more or less similar to middle class of Europe, from which about 7m programmers. What all these means? Few things. First - Chinese programmers are now busy in just filling emptiness, as they are culturally so different from West, that many Western soft is not fit, so Chinese  programmers need to make their local clones, and they now repeat steps, Western programmers made in 1950s..2000s, so 50 years. Oh, sorry, really computer revolution at West happen in late 1970s, with microcomputers, but anyway, at West we have programmers nearly all ages from school to about 80years old (2020-1980+30..40), but in China, most just about 40 years at most (2020-2005+20). Second - Chinese programmers don't have enough entrepreneurs, so they cannot got contact with clients, this is like huge concrete wall. Third, really First - Chinese population older than about 40 years, just don't have any feelings to computers. Believe me, I know lot of people for which virtual world is just don't exists, so Chinese programmers just don't have any feedback from their population, and so they cannot use their home country as foundation to grow. This is so serious obstacle, which just made literally impossible creation of something really interesting but not tied to huge corporation, and China don't have startup ecosystem, because it need decades to grow. So from all these points for me obvious, we could only see from China only big corporation products with Chinese specifics, and all known examples show this: few games, clone of internet search engine, clone of linux and lot of nearly unknown embedded software in Chinese products. In about 20 years things could change, if China will open culturally to West, but now they filling gap. reply",

That being said, they are pretty close to being in a \"closed universe\" of their own. Some companies are trying to open up (deepseek, tencent, alibaba, etc...) but it is a relatively a new thing. If you go low in the stack (Operating Systems, compilers, developer tools, etc...) it's all American but in mainland China they make everything custom and different (more aligned with their culture and how they do business). If you want to get in touch with them, find projects in GitHub where the Chinese hangs out (ie: they like P2P/sharing/decentralized stuff) and send an email. My experience is that they are eager to try your stuff or get in touch but there can be a significant language barrier. reply",

What is the most secure way of monitoring babies? Stay at home and look after it!! I cannot for the life of me ever understand why you would not have your baby as close as possible. Until I had children I thought I was a heavy sleeper. That is until my parental awareness took over. I did not need any CCTV or monitoring system. I naturally heard my babies every sounds. Those sounds that all babies make before they start to cry, because they are hungry or want some love. Great bonding experience, I really do not know how anyone would bond with a child via CCTV and monitoring system. What on earth did we all do before 1989 when the internet went live. reply",

          "text": "This may be too complex of a setup but if that were my task I would install one of the open source NVM's like ZoneMinder [1][2], get a few cameras and use port forwarding to HAProxy with basic authentication to keep bots off the ZoneMinder interface in the event of vulnerabilities .  This is only useful if you are not behind CG-NAT otherwise a VPN would have to be established from the home to a VM somewhere and then use that VM as the entry-point.  Your extended family members could also have a browser open watching what is going on in your home. That ZoneMinder or other open source NVM would double as home security so you could also watch all the doors, windows, yards, driveway, garage, etc...  Each NVM will have a webpage that lists the compatible cameras. I assume you mean to watch the baby while a babysitter is there and the baby is not truly alone.  There are also some NannyCam devices that hide the camera so you can also keep an eye on what the babysitter is doing with the baby in multiple rooms. None of this addresses E2EE but the server would be hosted in your house and would be using TLS to your web browser to watch it.

          "text": "I'm vibe coding a \"social media engine.\" Basically, I've noticed a bunch of social media protocols like ATProtocol, ActivityPub and Nostr are coming out and I think while having these protocols is a good idea, one thing limiting adoption is lack of differentiated social media sites on these protocols. Basically everyone keeps building twitter on a new protocol without offering anything novel. One bottleneck, I thought, is that there isn't a set of utilities to help build a new social network easily so everyone defaults to building twitter as an MVP. I wanted to make an engine, kind of like a game engine, but to make a custom social media for any particular protocol. Hypothetically this should make it so that development for these kinds of projects go way faster. Basically, like a very opinionated django rest framework. Hopefully developers will build more interesting, novel sites and increase adoption for these protocols reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "While all well and true. Some scale is assumed. There’s plenty of need for basic use invoicing like this. Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else. This project is being very transparent about what it does and how it works, which should help you out if you have a requirements list to compare it to. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

The accountant convinced them to switch to some \"better\" system and for around 3 months they had no idea how much money they had, they just lost all visibility into the system because it didn't work in the way they expected.  \"If things didn't look right, we'd just go through every screen in the system and press Post.\"  At the end of those 3 months they realized they had unexpectedly gotten into $70K in debt -- this was ~35 years ago when a house was around that much.  They had to take a second mortgage on their house.  Eventually, they figured out the accounting system, righted the ship, and paid back the second mortgage over a few years.  Y2K really helped, with that giant bump in sales. reply",

This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. I find this hard to believe. An invoice is a request for payment. A receipt is proof/confirmation of payment. Invoices sometimes double as receipts (or rather the other way around) when the payment is made immediately. But how can a country not have something that represents a formal request for payment by some future time? I don't even understand this from an accounting perspective. What would accounts receivable and accounts payable even mean without this distinction? How would you date the respective journal entries if there is no distinction? reply",

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

          "text": "My master's thesis[1] was half research, half dev project, exploring how we can continue to fully fuse traditional RPGs with computers. This goal is my life quest, my life's work. I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system. [1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me [2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree. So no VR, no video-tracked physical miniatures, no custom-designed tabletop, no Microsoft Surface... Again, just my opinion. reply",

All social data (issues, comments, PRs, other repo metadata) is stored “on-proto”—in your AT Protocol PDS. We don’t just plan to reimplement GitHub, but rethink and improve on the status quo. For instance, we plan to make stacked PRs and stacked diff-based reviews first-class citizens of the platform. Right now, our pull request feature is rather simplistic but very useful still: you paste your git diff output, and “resubmit” for a new round of review (if necessary).

And an automated design app that turns a 3D model from Fusion into something that's easy to change the parameters on. That way people can easily just type stuff in and move on to manufacturing.

          "text": "I released an iOS app last October for users who use Apple Watch to record their workouts - https://mergefit.itwenty.me It lets users merge two or more workouts into a single one. There have been times when I have been out riding, hiking or whatever and accidentally end the activity on my apple watch instead of pausing it. Starting a new workout means having your stats split across the two workouts. The \"usual\" way to merge such workouts is to export all of them to individual FIT files, then use a tool like fitfiletools.com to merge the individual FIT files. You then have a merged FIT file, which is difficult to import back into Apple Health. This process also requires access to the internet, which is not always guaranteed when out in remote areas. MergeFit makes this process easy by merging workouts right on device and without the need to deal with FIT files at all. It reads data directly from Apple Health and writes the merged data back to Apple Health. The app reached a small milestone a few days ago - crossing 1000$ in total sales. reply",

Will assemble and test over the next few weeks, then document properly. I got the matte black PCBs, they look really cool. A hardware quantum RNG. Made a mistake in the board power supply, but it still works well with cut trace and a bodge wire. Will probably fix the bug and put the results up in a few weeks. Can push out ~300 bytes of entropy a second, each as an MQTT message. A hardware device that just does E2E encrypted chat (using Curve 25519). Microcontrollers only, no OS, and nothing ever stored locally. HDMI output (1024x768), Wi-Fi, and USB keyboard support. I originally designed it to use a vanilla MQTT broker, but I'm probably going to move it to HTTP and just write a little self-hosted HTTP service that handles message routing and ephemeral key registration. Right now the encryption, video output, and USB host works -- but it was a tangle of wires to fix the initial bugs, so I ordered new boards. Got to put those through testing, then move on to writing the server. Iterating on hardware stuff is pretty slow. I try to test more than one bugfix in parallel on the same board. Iteration time is 2-3 weeks and 8$. If I have all the parts in stock. I don't have very much free time right now due to work, so this suits me fine. A rule I live by is that I must always be creating, so I think this is a reasonable compromise. reply",

The reason is that the current internet business model if depleted. Users are weary of the lack of reasonable stuff on the internet. Personally, I use my browser less and less each day. It has become, in my opinion, pretty much a wasteland. Given that situation, what can you do? One could just change careers. Or perhaps consider why things are this way. One path would be diagnose the current situation. Beginning with the predominant internet business model - tracking users. The number of obvious problems with this is large. I once read (not sure where) that the customer of the internet is advertisers, not users. Things will now quickly get worse in this version of the internet. The prey (users) will now be inundated with generated content. Yeah, yeah, I know this is dark and you don't want to read it. However, perhaps if we consider what it is possible to do with the internet if it wasn't so polluted there is quite a bright light. Fundamentally the internet provides an enhanced way for people to interact and communicate. There are indeed examples of this happening. I sometimes think We people are in a situation similar to a prehistoric culture that finds a steel axe. So we go around hacking everything in sight. But of course the thing about the axe is the metallurgy. Currently it appears to me that we have pretty much hacked everything to death with the internet and created a very nice waste land. Here's looking at you Google!!! So perhaps time to consider the equivalent of the metallurgy. reply",

My experience as a corporate is that I often find the 'US local' is a thin shell of sales/leadership, someone I feel I can hold accountable when I'm not getting results during the engagement, and the hands-on tactical folks on their team are typically globally dispersed. This has never been a hard sell for me internally to get approved. It's quite silly on our part because we end up paying $200/hr for resources that probably only see $30/hr of it; but finding a whole team of SME's in some Enterprise SW that are entirely US based can be quite difficult too. All said, you need to setup a US based sales office. Even if it's just optics, deflect and say you spend a lot of your time with the engineer's in India but come to States frequently for client meetings, then offer to fly to US for key points of the contract, etc. But, the key is making people think your operations is US based in the first-impression phase. reply",

          "text": "I run a small consulting shop in Germany, also specialising on PLM (and IoT) - I never landed a gig in the US. The problem with PLM is that more often than not you operate in high tech / defense and because of export control regulations you need residency. For getting projects in Europe, what worked for me is cold outreach on linkedin. However not directly for the end client (that really never worked) - but there are a lot of companies in between - medium size consulting shops / service integrators. Also digital strategy consulting shops sometimes realize in the middle of a project that they should better own the implementation themselves(because some other partner has been identified as unreliable or too expensive) \nA big aspect is being consistent and send a few messages per day. What also worked was applying to jobs, and after making the first contact breaking it to them that I actually run my own company but that I could solve the issue that they were trying to fix by hiring me. At last but not least - send me your CV to daniel a teide d tech - if you have experience with PTC's Windchill PLM there is a chance that I have work for you in the future.

Networking is everything, most of my gigs have come from trusted contacts I worked with as an employee in a subsidiary (opened by a US company) in my own country. Startups help here because people tend to move around with a trusted group of people. Every gig expands your network and builds more trust, so cracking those first few opportunities are important. Navigating legal/contractual: I can't read minds but you're probably overthinking this before you've secured a gig. Contractually, things are similar to working with a company at home. A lot of the complexity will be on the US company's side for how they deal with the expense of dealing with the expense of you for their reporting requirements to state authorities like the IRS.\nThis is why your network is so important, you have to be valuable enough so they're willing to pay for the friction. Most of your friction and hassle will come from dealing with foreign income within your own country's tax authority. Get help from professionals but it's not insurmountable. reply",

I want to make her younger again and then just let her have many more years of chilling and not having to make babies every year.  If can learn this well enough to reverse the age of a dozen horses then my second test subject would be myself.  If I get that right then my friends could optionally do the same.

          "text": "If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection. You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the \"Router\" field, that's how it works. Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process. As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work. It's a fairly clever setup. If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works. reply",

          "text": "This is almost certainly the answer and clever as hell. You just have to make sure the server storing the firmware (which you control) has the right CORS headers (as you mention) and you are in business. This means that the CarPlay device has no \"internet\" (spoiler: it never had real internet access) unless you are on that page interacting with it. I'm not sure how these devices work, I mean I know they broadcast themselves as a CarPlay head unit then \"somehow\" pass that to the car via a wired connection (pretending to be a phone connecting via USB). \"somehow\" being the important part. Does it hand along an encrypted stream that it can't decode or does it decode/re-encode? Either way I'd bet these devices are pretty safe to use. The phone sends a video feed, not raw \"data\" so the MitM (again, if that's how it works) would need to OCR the video to get anything useful since the raw video would be too large to store and too heavy to transfer over cellular (via it's own hidden radio, again, worst-case-scenario). If the device decodes the stream in the middle then the worst case I can think of is it could be doing on-device OCR and cellular radio to exfiltrate the text but I feel confident that you could spot the cellular radio (or someone who did a teardown). Without the radio it has no way to get data off the device which means the best it could do it sneak some out while you were on that update screen. Though I think that's all pretty far-fetched. EDIT: I went looking for some way to act as a CarPlay receiver and get the raw video feed and it looks like it's possible [0] so yeah, a malicious device could proxy the connect, OCR the result, and send data via its own cellular connection but that would be relatively easy to detect and not worth it unless you are the target of a nation state which, at that point, you have bigger problems.

I generally don't have any issues with charging, so phone either stays at the same battery level, or charges a bit (depending on how long I drive). The only downside is that phone heats up due to the usage of CarPlay as well as due to the wireless charging, which triggers heavy throttling of iOS, and I assume this is not ideal for the phone/battery as well. reply",

I'd use it a little differently, but it's my wife's car, not mine. Who would have thought a 2022 Mercedes would have wired-only CarPlay? Anyway, I find it excellent for podcast control.

Nothing more. Batteries will only last for about two hours when they're not new, and you have the docs on your machine without distractions online. This forces you to work only on what you're working on, and do it fast as the battery is discharging so you catch yourself more often \"drifting\" in your thoughts, and you'll get better at catching yourself and focusing again, because \"Quick! It's discharging!\" I know it sounds silly as you can just connect to the internet or plug your charger, but it really works. Its real job is to remind you to focus and get things done. Try it, and you'll find soon enough just how much of your attention was scattered, but you'll be weaning as soon. reply",

Today about 50% of the time I can just ask AI if it knows what I need. Although the other 50% of the time it will give me some BS hacky answers or just make something up – especially when I'm using less common libraries. Where I have got much lazier is when it comes to writing BS code like regexs, etc. It's not that I can't write them, I just know that it will take me longer to think about and create the regex than explaining to an LLM what I want to match on. But you still need to know regex to review it so I don't feel like losing any skills, just able to work faster in some cases like how pulling a email regex from SO would have help you code a solution faster a decade a go. reply",

          "text": "I'm a neurodivergent coder and have always been a \"code by reference\" person, so I will have API docs up even if I've done a thing 100 times. The context helps me get into the mindset of what I'm doing, and has helped me be productive. This fails when people expect rote memorization like in coding interviews, but it works well when I'm actually working through problems in a company - I have a set of references up and available, usually of the internal codebase. I use AI as an advanced reference primarily so I haven't had the problem as stated here yet! I think a lot of folks are finding that via AI they're switching over to the way that I do code, without the benefits of internal thinking structure I've had to come up with over time to manage it. I try to think of whatever I'm doing in a sort of scaffold, and then change my focus into the details. If you lose your ability to zoom in or out on layers of abstraction (because you don't understand whats happening in detail), that's when you need to spend time diving in. You can't just sit back all the time like a farmer who's got a machine to plow and tend to all the fields, you need to be doing QA and making sure its doing what it says its doing. If you're letting it handle what the scaffold is, you know even less. You decide which if any mental models you outsource to AI. You decide what you manage, and whats important for you to manage. Don't let short term productivity gains hobble your ability to zoom in! reply",

Right now, I do periodic  drive image backups to a secondary drive, a few periodic file backups to USB drives for documents but not images, and some periodic drive image backups to external drives.

Then I built a management dashboard in TypeScript/Node that provides web servers you can spin up in about 2seconds and each server provides Websockets and http with fully proxy support over a single port. The dashboard also provides a command terminal via browser interface and a bunch of other server and connection management tools. * I also included Samba for remote file system access from Windows with permission management. * I run Jellyfin with metadata caching so that I can stream video without need for internet access or subscriptions. * I run Pihole for DNS management. * I just got WireGuard set up so now I can VPN directly into the home network from anywhere in the world via IPv6.

These kinds of interviews aren't helpful to anybody. Instead the way to get past this foolishness is to ask open-ended questions expecting precise answers where the questions are themselves not precise.  This presents too much variance.  For example: Talk to me about the methods of your favorite Node code library. In that case the candidate has to pick, on the fly, from any of the libraries that ship with Node and immediately start talking about what like about certain methods and how they would use them. Another example: Tell me about full duplex communication on the web. AI will immediately point you to WebSockets, but it won't explain what full duplex means in 3 words or less or why WebSockets are full duplex and other solutions aren't. Another example: Given a single page application what things would you recommend to get full state restoration within half a second of page request? AI barfs on that one.  It starts explain what state restoration is, which doesn't answer the question. In other words AI is not a problem so long as you don't suck as an interviewer. reply",

Our interview process let's ride out the interview as a courtesy and to also try to extract something out of the candidate that the company could use. Anyway once they read out the first sentence from the AI with utmost sincerity, I'd follow-up with deeper questions into the topic at hand. 99% failed to answer the second question well. The ones who let me ask the third and fourth questions are devs who still have their original thinking hats in place but just use AI out of nervousness or who generally don't interview well.

But, yes, performance is something users universally care very much about even if many businesses aren't willing to accept that, so the question remains highly relevant.  Another way a good interviewer, who has a background in performance, to consider this is to start asking performance questions that a candidate could answer from AI and the asking the candidate why some performance techniques work better than others and by how much.  Then you can really see if they have a high confidence AI answer that they cannot quality. At any point, AI answers aren't a challenge for people who are confidence enough in the craft to ask more qualified questions and determine honesty from the resulting nonverbal signals. reply",

          "text": "Hey! Creator of stealthinterview.ai here. After working for 15 years at FAANG, startups and no-name companies, I have conducted more than a 100 interviews for all levels, mostly in engineering. In my experience with technical interviews specifically, there are 4 types of candidates: - the memorizer\n- the mathematical brain\n- the project builder\n- the coding enthusiast that knows a language well but can’t do algorithms Most of the time, I have encountered candidates in buckets 3 and 4. Many showed debugging skills, communication skills, but lacked the right answer to trapping rainwater. I was told to reject candidates who couldn’t pass these problems mainly on the grounds of solved or not solved, even if they clearly communicated. The only reason I got into FAANG companies myself is because I was the good memorizer. I couldn’t solve most of these problems today without months of prep. At the end, I left my FAANG job recently because I realized it’s going to be the same or worse at any other company, because internally it’s all the same B.S. once you make it in. Sure, you’ll get a fat salary, but it’s a slow grind. Instead, I chose to build things. Is the interview process today bad? I think so. What can candidates do about it? Take it in their own hands and play the game or get played. What is the alternative? Depends. There are many companies that don’t do crazy algorithm interviews and pay really well. In my opinion, if you are hiring hundreds of engineers per year, take-home assessments and reviewing them is literally a job on its own. Making candidates build apps from scratch and deploy it, test it, present it? Maybe, but certainly opinionated, not binary. New grads don’t have experience, but experienced engineers do. You shouldn’t need to ask people with 10 years of experience about trapping rainwater from LC. There are so many other things to ask, discuss, and gauge experience, scope and depth. reply",

          "text": "Personally, if Im hiring junior engineers, and they have the ability to use LLM to solve the problem and explain it, I see no problem with that. When I worked for Amazon knowing the kind of development that happens someone who is able to code with an assistant could do the necessary work faster than someone who codes without it. This is the same type of test as the takehome tests that a lot of companies give, where you can use google or stack overflow previously to do research. If I was hiring for my own project and needed people that can problem solve, I would be asking more involved questions that LLMs could not solve, because LLMS will give you just the standard most commonly used solution. For example an analogy to another industry, LLMs can't tell you how to design a mountain bike correctly at a level of detail that matters, because there is no guide online that tells you how to do this. reply",

          "text": "I strongly believe technical interviews should try to mirror a pair programming session on a problem as if it was work, rather than a quiz or interrogation type format. If someone asked during such a session (where it's cameras, screenshare) that they wanted to do something like google some documentation, I wouldn't see that as a problem. Obviously it's a problem if someone just googles for a solution and pastes it in. I see LLMs in the same way. No issue with them using it do something like take the pseudo code they wrote in front of me and turned it into an implementation. Especially if they could talk through this code and make suggestions about further changes and so on, clearly showing they understand what's going on. The real concern is going to be when sophisticated agents can impersonate (clone voice and video) in a convincing way, as well as the capabilities to see the screen and type away as if it was a real person, and they're responding to you in real time. If the software is based on the models made by large companies, they'll be happy to give you recipes. They would refuse if the coding request mentioned something about cracking passwords or dumping credit cards. And all of them will have a meltdown if you try to ask them to say something politically incorrect (what a bizarre world that would be if that became the new captcha system for humans trying to figure out if they're wasting their time with a fake human). That said, this is going to be a cat and mouse game. There will be nothing to stop people from fine tuning models to get around being \"jailbreaked\" to reveal themselves as LLMs. Perhaps the best means is taking the time to research problems that causes \"vibe coding\" to completely fall down. And that is likely going to be things that are novel and haven't been littered all over the internet. That has a knock on effect of making such interviews a bit more interesting for the people doing them too. reply",

          "text": "Leetcode style questions no longer work. If it's solvable with a few functions within 1 hour, AI will solve it in 5 minutes. If the job is cutting trees, you can't measure them by how long they take to cut a tree, but whether they have stamina to cut through multiple trees. Take home assignments work, and the good news is they can be shorter now. 1 day or 4 hours of work is enough of a benchmark. Something like a Wordle clone is about the right level of complexity. Things we look for: 1. Do they use a library? Some people are a bit egoistic about doing things the easy way. GenAI will make a list of words, which is both wasteful and incomplete when they can find a dictionary of words. Do they cut down the dictionary to the right size? It should only be the words not definitions. 2. Architecture? What do they normally use? How do the parts link to one another? How do they handle errors? 3. Do they bring in something new? AI will usually use a 5 year old tech stack unless you give it a specific one, because that's around the average of code it's trained on. If they're experienced enough to tell AI to use the new tech, they're probably experienced enough. 4. Require a starting commit (probably gitignore) and ask them to add reasonable sized commits. Classic coding should look a bit like painting. Vibe coding looks like sculpting, where you chip bits off. This will also catch more critical cheating, like someone else doing the work on their behalf - the commits may be from the wrong emails or you'll see massive commits where nothing gets chipped off. 5. There are going to be people who think AI is a nuisance. Tests like this will help you benchmark the different factions. But don't give them so much toil that it puts the AI users at a large advantage and don't give overly complex \"solved\" questions that the AI can just pull out from training. reply",

          "text": "We basically look for this: https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide It's similar across all mobile platforms. People call it MVVM, Bloc, MVP, etc. But we want to see the pattern of UI-repo-service and unidirectional data flow. This is three layers and it can be as little as 3 files. If someone can grasp that, it's good enough. There's not a lot of ways you can screw up hiring mobile devs; most skills are trainable. But this is what costs months. One guy once looped the viewmodel inside another viewmodel because he was using them as the data store and observable. He was let go but it took 2 years to remove everything he did from production even though he worked there for 3 months and most of it was via rewriting entire blocks of code. We watch for overengineering and perfectionism. Some people insist on more blocks or splitting it into modules. But can they do that in 4 hours? AI can write all of it easy enough, but it's just a 2-3x multiplier. Some assume it's an infinite multiplier and they can just subscribe to Cursor on the spot and it'll be done in a blink. But do the parts connect in the order given above? Also Wordle is not ideal for architecture, but it's good enough. It requires a solid understanding of the top level of things, and connection to the data layer. What if we switched the word source from the dictionary to the API? That's a bit more of an advanced test. An even more advanced test would be structuring it for TDD, which would need understanding of DI, factories, tests and gotchas, etc. I don't think this is doable even with AI yet though. As a UI test, Wordle is pretty good because you have all your logic and variables on one layer and display it via a different, more complex layer. reply",

But if it’s just some random job that doesn’t like people using AI for some bogus reason, give me a break. They can make the rules as easily as people can break them.

It writes dialogue like a 16 year old, enthusiastic and amateurish. I like riffing off AI's creativity. It gives me creative ideas for scenes and conflicts, and I carve whatever it gives me into something pretty, like a lapidarist. Also AI helped in writing an engine for it - things like VNs don't normally allow for the pacing of good dialogue. So I had to do something to allow for a little back and forth, interruptions, change of tone, etc. reply",

Until I had children I thought I was a heavy sleeper. That is until my parental awareness took over. I did not need any CCTV or monitoring system. I naturally heard my babies every sounds. Those sounds that all babies make before they start to cry, because they are hungry or want some love. Great bonding experience, I really do not know how anyone would bond with a child via CCTV and monitoring system. What on earth did we all do before 1989 when the internet went live. reply",

This is only useful if you are not behind CG-NAT otherwise a VPN would have to be established from the home to a VM somewhere and then use that VM as the entry-point.  Your extended family members could also have a browser open watching what is going on in your home. That ZoneMinder or other open source NVM would double as home security so you could also watch all the doors, windows, yards, driveway, garage, etc...  Each NVM will have a webpage that lists the compatible cameras. I assume you mean to watch the baby while a babysitter is there and the baby is not truly alone.  There are also some NannyCam devices that hide the camera so you can also keep an eye on what the babysitter is doing with the baby in multiple rooms. None of this addresses E2EE but the server would be hosted in your house and would be using TLS to your web browser to watch it.

          "text": "There is more than one way to answer this. They have made an alternative to the CUDA language with HIP, which can do most of the things the CUDA language can. You could say that they haven't released supporting libraries like cuDNN, but they are making progress on this with AiTer for example. You could say that they have fragmented their efforts across too many different paradigms but I don't think this is it because Nvidia also support a lot of different programming models. I think the reason is that they have not prioritised support for ROCm across all of their products. There are too many different architectures with varying levels of support. This isn't just historical. There is no ROCm support for their latest AI Max 395 APU. There is no nice cross architecture ISA like PTX. The drivers are buggy. It's just all a pain to use. And for that reason \"the community\" doesn't really want to use it, and so it's a second class citizen. This is a management and leadership problem. They need to make using their hardware easy. They need to support all of their hardware. They need to fix their driver bugs. reply",

          "text": "It is a little bit more complicated than ROCm simply not having support because ROCm has at a point claimed support, and they've had to walk it back painfully (multiple times). Its not a driver issue, nor a hardware issue on their side. There has been a long-standing issue between AMD and its mainboard manufacturers. The issue has to do with features required for ROCm, namely PCIe Atomics. AMD has been unable or unwilling to hold the mainboard manufacturers to account for advertising features the mainboard does not support. The CPU itself must support this feature, but the mainboard must as well (in firmware). One of the reasons why ROCm hasn't worked in the past is because the mainboard manufacturers have claimed and advertised support for PCIe Atomics, and the support they've claimed has been shown to be false, and the software fails in non-deterministic ways when tested. This is nightmare fuel for the few AMD engineers tasked with ROCm. PCIe Atomics requires non-translated direct IO to operate correctly, and in order to support the same CPU models from multiple generations they've translated these IO lines in firmware. This has left most people that query their system to check this showing PCIAtomics is supported, while when actual tests that rely on that support are done they fail, in chaotic ways. There is no technical specification or advertising that the mainboard manufacturers provide showing whether this is supported. Even the boards with multiple x16 slots and the many technologies related to it such as Crossfire/SLI/mGPU brandings these don't necessarily show whether PCIAtomics is properly supported. In other words, the CPU is supported, the firmware/mainboard fail with no way to differentiate between the two at the upper layers of abstraction. All in all. You shouldn't be blaming AMD for this. You should be blaming the three mainboard manufacturers who chose to do this. Some of these manufacturers have upper end boards where they actually did do this right they just chose to not do this for any current gen mainboard costing less than ~$300-500. reply",

          "text": "I want to argue that graphics cards are really 3 markets: integrated, gaming (dedicated), and compute. Not only do these have different hardware (fixed function, ray tracing cores, etc.) but also different programming and (importantly) distribution models. NVIDIA went from 2 to 3. Intel went from 1 to 2, and bought 3 (trying to merge). AMD started with 2 and went to 1 (around Llano) and attempted the same thing as NVIDIA via GCN (please correct me if I'm wrong). My understanding is that the reason is that the real market for 3 (GPUs for compute) didn't show up until very late, so AMD's GCN bet didn't pay off. Even in 2021, NVIDIA's revenue from gaming was above data center revenue (a segment they basically had no competition in, and 100% of their revenue was from CUDA). AMD meanwhile won the battle for Playstation and Xbox consoles, and was executing a turnaround in data centers with EPYC and CPUs (with Zen). So my guess as to why they might have underinvested is basically: for much of the 2010s they were just trying to survive, so they focused on battles they could win that would bring them revenue. This high level prioritization would explain a lot of \"misexecution\", e.g. if they underhired for ROCm, or prioritized APU SDK experience over data center, their testing philosophy (\"does this game work ok? great\"). reply",

Their driver is also far more stable than AMD's. But AMD is also improving, they've made some significant strides over the last 12-18 months. But I think more importantly, what is often missed in this analysis is that most programmers doing ML work aren't writing their own custom kernels. They're just using pytorch (or maybe something even more abstracted/multi-backend like keras 3.x) and let the library deal with implementation details related to their GPU. That doesn't mean there aren't footguns in that particular land of abstraction, but the delta between the two providers is not nearly as stark as its often portrayed. At least not for the average programmer working with ML tooling. (EDIT: also worth noting that the work being done in the MLIR project has a role to play in closing the gap as well for similar reasons) reply",

          "text": "AMD was investing in a drop-in CUDA compatibility layer & cross-compiler! Perhaps in keeping with the broader thread here, they had only ever funded a single contract developer working on it, and then discontinued the project (for who-knows-what legal or political reasons). But the developer had specified that he could open-source the pre-AMD state if the contract was dissolved, and he did exactly that! The project is active with an actively contributing community, and is rapidly catching up to where it was. https://www.phoronix.com/review/radeon-cuda-zluda https://vosen.github.io/ZLUDA/blog/zludas-third-life/ https://vosen.github.io/ZLUDA/blog/zluda-update-q4-2024/ IMO it's vital that even if NVIDIA's future falters in some way, the (likely) collective millennia of research built on top of CUDA will continue to have a path forward on other constantly-improving hardware. It's frustrating that AMD will benefit from this without contributing - but given the entire context of this thread, maybe it's best that they aren't actively managing the thing that gives their product a future! reply",

If you hold off for a the pop could happen at an indefinite time; maybe very far from now , then I think that invalidates the individual prediction. One frustrating aspect of investing is that confident information is tough to come by. It's my take that if you have any (I personally rarely do), you should act on it. So, when someone claims confidently (e.g. with adjectives that imply confidence) that something's going to happen, then that's better than the default. I don't have the insight the claimer does; my thought is: \"I am jealous. I with I could be that confident about a stock's trajectory. I would act on it.\" reply",

          "text": "Hi d_burfoot, really appreciate you bringing that up! The idea of pre-training a big foundation model on our raw data using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (kind of like how GPT emerged in NLP) is definitely something we've considered and experimented with using transformer architectures. The main hurdle we've hit is honestly the scale of relevant data needed to train such large models from scratch effectively. While our ~19.5 years dataset duration is massive for ecoacoustics, a significant portion of it is silence or ambient noise. This means the actual volume of distinct events or complex acoustic scenes is much lower compared to the densely packed information in the corpora typically used to train foundational speech or general audio models, making our effective dataset size smaller in that context. We also tried leveraging existing pre-trained SSL models (like Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT for speech), but the domain gap is substantial. As you can imagine, raw ecoacoustic field recordings are characterized by significant non-stationary noise, overlapping sounds, sparse events we care about mixed with lots of quiet/noise, huge diversity, and variations from mics/weather. This messes with the SSL pre-training tasks themselves. Predicting masked audio doesn't work as well when the surrounding context is just noise, and the data augmentations used in contrastive learning can sometimes accidentally remove the unique signatures of the animal calls we're trying to learn. It's definitely an ongoing challenge in the field! People are trying different things, like initializing audio transformers with weights pre-trained on image models (ViT adapted for spectrograms) to give them a head start. Finding the best way forward for large models in these specialized, data-constrained domains is still key. Thanks again for the suggestion, it really hits on a core challenge! reply",

You're absolutely right, audio provides that crucial omnidirectional coverage that can supplement fixed field-of-view sensors like cameras. We actually collect images too and have explored fusion approaches, though they definitely come with their own set of challenges, as you can imagine. On the labeled audio data front: our Arctic dataset (EDANSA, linked in my original post) is open source. We've actually updated it with more samples since the initial release, and getting the new version out is on my to-do list. Polli.ai looks fantastic!

This project was born out of the frustration of trying to generate an invoice on my phone on the go, I found all the existing solutions to be quite awful (forced signups to paid subscriptions, clunky interface etc). Would love to hear any feedback the HN crowd has. I'm aware of a couple of alignment issues, will fix them up tonight. Also, yes, there will be a \"generate PDF\" button, for now if you want a pdf I'd suggest using the Print dialog to \"Save as PDF\". https://bestfreeinvoice.com reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

There are plenty countries where the vendor will charge the account of the customer, like a 'pull' mechanism. In many countries they'll use (or used) checks/cheques for that, or a different payment account like a credit card. The agreement for this would have been a contract. They may still use invoices for larger transactions, but they aren't always required by law. I remember that in the old days, Google, Stripe, etc wouldn't send invoices, sometimes you'd get a minimal receipt message by email, but that was about it. This was particularly annoying for EU-based companies where there are minimal requirements for invoices and/or receipts. Times have changed though. Most companies, including US-based, will now offer invoices that comply with most international regulations. Except PayPal of course, for some reason they still seem to get away with not offering invoices.

Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else.

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

          "text": "My master's thesis[1] was half research, half dev project, exploring how we can continue to fully fuse traditional RPGs with computers. This goal is my life quest, my life's work. I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system. [1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me [2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree. So no VR, no video-tracked physical miniatures, no custom-designed tabletop, no Microsoft Surface... Again, just my opinion. reply",

Dealing with the scale of Reddit (~300 posts/second) creates some interesting technical challenges. It's also let me polish up my frontend development skills.

          "text": "There’s this popular pastime lately where people pretend to be the last rational mind on Earth while making blanket pronouncements about tech they don’t understand. >“Avoid it! Perplexity rules prohibit commercial use…” Cool story, but also: irrelevant. Nobody serious is shipping products on Perplexity as a backend. It’s a research tool with a nice wrapper. The people building with LLMs are using OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Groq, and Ollama, depending on the constraints and goals. Acting like the existence of one walled garden invalidates an entire paradigm is like saying cars are bad because golf carts can’t go on highways. > “ChatGPT rules prohibit sharing the output with other AI…” There are some restrictions, yes. And that matters… if your use case is literally just shuttling model output between APIs like a glorified message broker. Most developers are fine with this because they’re building systems, not playing telephone. > “They’re training on everything you pass in…” This is just flat wrong. OpenAI doesn’t train on API input/output unless you explicitly opt in. The fact that this myth is still circulating tells me people are repeating each other instead of reading the docs. > “You’re paying to get brain raped…” If your argument requires dehumanizing metaphors to land, you don’t have an argument. You have trauma cosplay. > “Coding with OpenAI = being a sheep…” This is the kind of thing people say when they’ve never delivered software in production. The tools either help or they don’t. Calling people sheep for using powerful tools is anti-intellectualism dressed up as cynicism. Nobody’s building a search engine from scratch to prove they’re not a sheep either. We use leverage. That’s the whole game. > “You’re paying them to train their model to imitate you…” Actually, no — again, unless you opt in. But even if that were true, you’re also trading that data for time saved, features shipped, and workflows unlocked. You know, ROI. > “Better off learning a better (compiled) programming language…” I have nothing against compiled languages, but this is like telling someone struggling with Figma that they should learn Blender. It might be good advice in a vacuum, but it doesn’t help you win the game that’s actually being played. > “Why pay OpenAI for the privilege to help them take your job?” You could’ve said the same thing about AWS. Or GitHub. Or Stack Overflow. Or even programming itself, in the mainframe era. Gatekeeping based on purity is a waste of time. The actual work is understanding what AI can do, what it shouldn’t do, and when to lean in. > “Why outsource mental activity to a service with a customer noncompete?” You’re not outsourcing thinking. You’re compressing cognitive overhead. There’s a difference. If you think using AI is “outsourcing thinking,” you were probably outsourcing thinking to Stack Overflow and Copilot already. ⸻ Look, are there risks? Costs? Vendor lock-in traps? Of course. Anyone seriously building with AI right now is absorbing all that volatility and pushing forward anyway, because the upside is that massive. Dismissing the entire space as a scam or a trap is either willful ignorance or fear masquerading as intellectual superiority. If you don’t want to use AI tools, don’t. But don’t throw rocks from the sidelines at the people out there testing edge cases, logging failures, bleeding tokens, and figuring out what’s possible. reply",

          "text": "Personally, I would get started using Aider.chat.  It's pretty intuitive if you're comfortable in a terminal. No matter what, the current paradigm is the \"mixture of experts\", aka defining roles and then switching between the roles.  In the case of Aider, you're mainly looking at \"architect\" and \"code\".  Others like Cline/Roo provide also this, but more limitations and access to MCP.  Honestly, I would avoid these more advanced tools until you get an understanding for how everything works. Begin with your \"architect\" and agree on a design, then act as an engineering manager to guide your \"code\" model to implement the tests.  Once you have a full test suite, make sure that you can use commands like `/lint` and `/test` to call  your toolchain as needed. I personally prefer this method (again, when you're getting started) because it's independent of every IDE and will work anywhere you have a terminal.  After you get comfortable, you'll quickly want to use a more advanced tool to trade your money for the time of the machine(s).  When you get to that point you'll understand what the fuss is about. reply",

It seems like it's just overloading the standard vscode UI, with no regard for what you're used to. Trying to press tab for what looks like a \"normal\" autocomplete will invoke the LLM autocomplete that will replace a bunch of lines somewhere else without you noticing. Terrible UX! Modifications made by the chat interface are also hard to restrict to a specific part. Sure, you can give it context, but asking it to modify one thing (by highlighting a bunch of rows in a specific file and giving them as context) is likely to end up modifying a similar-looking thing somewhere else. The potential is there with Cursor, but right now it's a mess for serious use. Waiting for editors that incorporate LLM-based autocomplete in a disciplined way where I'll actually feel like I'm the one in control. Maybe once the dumb hype around vibe coding dies down. reply",

          "text": "Admittedly, I’ve achieved so much with the assistance of extensions like Cline/Roo that I have a sort of youthful exuberance that wants to proclaim that the barrier to entry to building applications with AI is falling. It’s not. These tools will literally waste your time and empty your wallet if you don’t have a solid approach — and that starts with knowing how to detect code and architecture smells at light speed. These tools are writing code faster than you can read it so you better know what you’ve (actually) instructed it to do, and be able to monitor the quality in a 300ms glance or you’re hosed. Having said that, there are antidotes: 1. Use a memory-bank. A memory bank is a little folder where you instruct the agent to research upcoming tasks, store progress info, post gotchas, generate retrospectives and more. It’s super helpful if the thing you’re building is large and complex. 2. Instruct the agent to implement strict TDD/BDD principles and force it to follow a red-green-refactor workflow at a granular level. The downside to this is twice the code (read $tokens) per feature but you’ll spend it anyway when your agent has 600 lines of untested code written while you grabbed coffee and you come back to the agent stuck in a loop, spending $0.20 per request sending the same large files trying to figure out some syntax error between test and code files. 3. You need to know what you’re doing. The model/agent is not going to automatically apply second and third order thinking to look around systems design corners. It does exactly what you tell it to do (sometimes well) but you also have to always be considering what you forgot to tell it to do (or not to do). Prompt engineering is not natural language. It’s a form of spellweaving where you have to find the edges of all relevant forms of existence and non-existence, codify them into imperative language, add the right nuance to finesse the style and have the confidence to cast the spell — over and over and over again. 4. You need money. Building a serious endeavor with an AI agent will cost you around $400-600 a month. Leave room for lots of mistakes. Prepare for weeping and gnashing of teeth when the task counter hits $10.00, you’re like 20% done with the feature, the model has lost context about what it was doing and you have to choose between making a broken commit and hoping the agent can sort it out in a clean task, or eating the cost and starting over. I spent $50 on starting over just this past weekend. This is why I wrote numbers 1-3 above. I’m committed to figuring out where all the pitfalls are so others might not have to. I personally feel like anyone who’s doing this right now is really just burning some cash to see what’s possible. reply",

          "text": "Here's my left-field pitch since everyone's shopping the A.IDEs - don't use them. The polish of Cursor et al is a component of its dishonesty. You should keep the nature of the tool exposed to you at all times. I say you should: - identify the things about your personal development process that you'd like to streamline (up to and including not having to code everything by hand) - write Python scripts that call LLMs (or don't!) to achieve the thing you want. - heck, write library functions and establish some neat patterns - a random prompt picker using a folder of txt files, why not? Not only can you create a development experience that approximates much of what Cursor does, you can make one that is twice as good for you because it is aligned with how you work, and how you think. And at that point, with your fluent new workflow, making a simple VSCode extension to hook into your scripts can't be all that hard. At that point, how can Cursor compete? reply",

But to answer your question, AI will ultimately eliminate every job in the sense that if you believe AI will eventually be able do any task, and do it for cheaper than a human labourer, then there would be no reason for you to ever pay a human labourer. The best analogy here is probably how the industrial revolution made the horse redundant. It's not that horses can't be used for physically demanding work anymore, it's simply that it's cheaper in practically every imaginable case to use a machine so horses are no longer used. Of course, machines didn't replace the use of horses in all industries over night and we should expect the same will happen with AI. I'll assume this is what you're asking. It seems rather obviously to me that knowledge workers will be the easiest to replace with AI – especially knowledge workers who work purely digitally. The hardest work to replace will likely be physical labour since robotics is still very far from biological sophistication required to be competent at many physical jobs. And even when it starts to become competent it's going to take a while to build the robots to replace labourers and do so at a competitive cost. reply",

          "text": "> \"age of abundance\" No such thing will come to pass in the common way you think. This is classic doublespeak. Similar to \"You will own nothing and be happy\". If you think hard on it, the only way that can be true is by limiting the scope of the number of people involved, and the only way to do that is if a large number of people die, and that is what they mean and intend when they do not explicitly spell out how you get from statement to reality, addressing the complex hidden dependencies. It is unlikely that any blue-collar job will be impacted aside from the 2nd order effects that occur as displaced workers move to other areas as a necessity for survival. That won't last long though before the monetary and economic systems break down as they will have more chaotic whipsaws than the labor market. As for how safe are other jobs. You can expect all white collar low complexity work, normally found in entry level positions on career ladders, and related support staff, to be at extreme risk. The upper echelon of senior positions, and even mid-level positions are safe, due to the abstract nature of the tasks required, but are confounded by additional costs being imposed by third-parties (i.e. ghost jobs/postings). There's no good way to evaluate you have this degree of experience/knowledge, and worse you lose this type of knowledge if you don't use it regularly. The career pipeline however is a sequential pipeline. If there is no one going into the pipeline because AI has blocked and replaced the entry-level worker as a surrogate, and there is no one for the mid and senior level people to pass knowledge to because they've all been replaced by an AI it won't happen, and as those mid and senior level people age out you find yourself in a hysteresis problem that cannot be solved in the time period needed. The same as any ponzi scheme. Three stages. The funding mechanism for almost all companies today ensures this is always a problem for next quarter, creating a cascading failure, or slow motion trainwreck of costs where the employer will be unable to find any labor meeting that criteria for any price by stage 3. If this happens in critical national dependencies then you get a full blown socio-economic collapse in an environment of ecological overshoot (Malthus/Catton) that is global in nature (via reserve currency). Not pretty, 1/3 of 4bn people might survive such, maybe, and that's as a global population. We've known how to build resilient systems for quite some time, but resilient systems cost more and in furtherance of globalization optimization has coincided towards brittle single-point-of-failures broadly. It allows the most chaos, which speculators and companies alike use to reap gross profits at everyone elses expense through plausible narratives backed by price fixing. reply",

          "text": "My unfounded belief is that the environment is changing dramatically, and will continue to change. And not because of AI. The reason is that the current internet business model if depleted. Users are weary of the lack of reasonable stuff on the internet. Personally, I use my browser less and less each day. It has become, in my opinion, pretty much a wasteland. Given that situation, what can you do? One could just change careers. Or perhaps consider why things are this way. One path would be diagnose the current situation. Beginning with the predominant internet business model - tracking users. The number of obvious problems with this is large. I once read (not sure where) that the customer of the internet is advertisers, not users. Things will now quickly get worse in this version of the internet. The prey (users) will now be inundated with generated content. Yeah, yeah, I know this is dark and you don't want to read it. However, perhaps if we consider what it is possible to do with the internet if it wasn't so polluted there is quite a bright light. Fundamentally the internet provides an enhanced way for people to interact and communicate. There are indeed examples of this happening. I sometimes think We people are in a situation similar to a prehistoric culture that finds a steel axe. So we go around hacking everything in sight. But of course the thing about the axe is the metallurgy. Currently it appears to me that we have pretty much hacked everything to death with the internet and created a very nice waste land. Here's looking at you Google!!! So perhaps time to consider the equivalent of the metallurgy. reply",

However not directly for the end client (that really never worked) - but there are a lot of companies in between - medium size consulting shops / service integrators. Also digital strategy consulting shops sometimes realize in the middle of a project that they should better own the implementation themselves(because some other partner has been identified as unreliable or too expensive) \nA big aspect is being consistent and send a few messages per day. What also worked was applying to jobs, and after making the first contact breaking it to them that I actually run my own company but that I could solve the issue that they were trying to fix by hiring me.

My experience as a corporate is that I often find the 'US local' is a thin shell of sales/leadership, someone I feel I can hold accountable when I'm not getting results during the engagement, and the hands-on tactical folks on their team are typically globally dispersed. This has never been a hard sell for me internally to get approved. It's quite silly on our part because we end up paying $200/hr for resources that probably only see $30/hr of it; but finding a whole team of SME's in some Enterprise SW that are entirely US based can be quite difficult too. All said, you need to setup a US based sales office. Even if it's just optics, deflect and say you spend a lot of your time with the engineer's in India but come to States frequently for client meetings, then offer to fly to US for key points of the contract, etc. But, the key is making people think your operations is US based in the first-impression phase. reply",

Networking is everything, most of my gigs have come from trusted contacts I worked with as an employee in a subsidiary (opened by a US company) in my own country. Startups help here because people tend to move around with a trusted group of people. Every gig expands your network and builds more trust, so cracking those first few opportunities are important. Navigating legal/contractual: I can't read minds but you're probably overthinking this before you've secured a gig. Contractually, things are similar to working with a company at home. A lot of the complexity will be on the US company's side for how they deal with the expense of dealing with the expense of you for their reporting requirements to state authorities like the IRS.\nThis is why your network is so important, you have to be valuable enough so they're willing to pay for the friction. Most of your friction and hassle will come from dealing with foreign income within your own country's tax authority. Get help from professionals but it's not insurmountable. reply",

          "text": "If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection. You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the \"Router\" field, that's how it works. Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process. As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work. It's a fairly clever setup. If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works. reply",

          "text": "This is almost certainly the answer and clever as hell. You just have to make sure the server storing the firmware (which you control) has the right CORS headers (as you mention) and you are in business. This means that the CarPlay device has no \"internet\" (spoiler: it never had real internet access) unless you are on that page interacting with it. I'm not sure how these devices work, I mean I know they broadcast themselves as a CarPlay head unit then \"somehow\" pass that to the car via a wired connection (pretending to be a phone connecting via USB). \"somehow\" being the important part. Does it hand along an encrypted stream that it can't decode or does it decode/re-encode? Either way I'd bet these devices are pretty safe to use. The phone sends a video feed, not raw \"data\" so the MitM (again, if that's how it works) would need to OCR the video to get anything useful since the raw video would be too large to store and too heavy to transfer over cellular (via it's own hidden radio, again, worst-case-scenario). If the device decodes the stream in the middle then the worst case I can think of is it could be doing on-device OCR and cellular radio to exfiltrate the text but I feel confident that you could spot the cellular radio (or someone who did a teardown). Without the radio it has no way to get data off the device which means the best it could do it sneak some out while you were on that update screen. Though I think that's all pretty far-fetched. EDIT: I went looking for some way to act as a CarPlay receiver and get the raw video feed and it looks like it's possible [0] so yeah, a malicious device could proxy the connect, OCR the result, and send data via its own cellular connection but that would be relatively easy to detect and not worth it unless you are the target of a nation state which, at that point, you have bigger problems.

The only downside is that phone heats up due to the usage of CarPlay as well as due to the wireless charging, which triggers heavy throttling of iOS, and I assume this is not ideal for the phone/battery as well. reply",

I'd use it a little differently, but it's my wife's car, not mine. Who would have thought a 2022 Mercedes would have wired-only CarPlay? Anyway, I find it excellent for podcast control.

Nothing more. Batteries will only last for about two hours when they're not new, and you have the docs on your machine without distractions online. This forces you to work only on what you're working on, and do it fast as the battery is discharging so you catch yourself more often \"drifting\" in your thoughts, and you'll get better at catching yourself and focusing again, because \"Quick! It's discharging!\" I know it sounds silly as you can just connect to the internet or plug your charger, but it really works. Its real job is to remind you to focus and get things done. Try it, and you'll find soon enough just how much of your attention was scattered, but you'll be weaning as soon. reply",

For me the main difference is that I search and read much less when problem solving. In the past I'd often have to search docs and SO for ages looking for information about some bug/functionality. Today about 50% of the time I can just ask AI if it knows what I need. Although the other 50% of the time it will give me some BS hacky answers or just make something up – especially when I'm using less common libraries. Where I have got much lazier is when it comes to writing BS code like regexs, etc. It's not that I can't write them, I just know that it will take me longer to think about and create the regex than explaining to an LLM what I want to match on. But you still need to know regex to review it so I don't feel like losing any skills, just able to work faster in some cases like how pulling a email regex from SO would have help you code a solution faster a decade a go. reply",

I think I am the sweet spot for them.  Much more experienced than a beginner because I know when to use classes, certain data types etc and can get the LLM to do what I ask and make changes when it’s crap.  But not nearly good enough to construct algorithms in my head, which is probably a big advantage to an experienced coder and LLMs help to catch the rest of us up (though definitely do not replace.) reply",

          "text": "I'm a neurodivergent coder and have always been a \"code by reference\" person, so I will have API docs up even if I've done a thing 100 times. The context helps me get into the mindset of what I'm doing, and has helped me be productive. This fails when people expect rote memorization like in coding interviews, but it works well when I'm actually working through problems in a company - I have a set of references up and available, usually of the internal codebase. I use AI as an advanced reference primarily so I haven't had the problem as stated here yet! I think a lot of folks are finding that via AI they're switching over to the way that I do code, without the benefits of internal thinking structure I've had to come up with over time to manage it. I try to think of whatever I'm doing in a sort of scaffold, and then change my focus into the details. If you lose your ability to zoom in or out on layers of abstraction (because you don't understand whats happening in detail), that's when you need to spend time diving in. You can't just sit back all the time like a farmer who's got a machine to plow and tend to all the fields, you need to be doing QA and making sure its doing what it says its doing. If you're letting it handle what the scaffold is, you know even less. You decide which if any mental models you outsource to AI. You decide what you manage, and whats important for you to manage. Don't let short term productivity gains hobble your ability to zoom in! reply",

For example: Talk to me about the methods of your favorite Node code library. In that case the candidate has to pick, on the fly, from any of the libraries that ship with Node and immediately start talking about what like about certain methods and how they would use them. Another example: Tell me about full duplex communication on the web. AI will immediately point you to WebSockets, but it won't explain what full duplex means in 3 words or less or why WebSockets are full duplex and other solutions aren't. Another example: Given a single page application what things would you recommend to get full state restoration within half a second of page request? AI barfs on that one.  It starts explain what state restoration is, which doesn't answer the question. In other words AI is not a problem so long as you don't suck as an interviewer. reply",

Our interview process let's ride out the interview as a courtesy and to also try to extract something out of the candidate that the company could use.

But, yes, performance is something users universally care very much about even if many businesses aren't willing to accept that, so the question remains highly relevant.  Another way a good interviewer, who has a background in performance, to consider this is to start asking performance questions that a candidate could answer from AI and the asking the candidate why some performance techniques work better than others and by how much.  Then you can really see if they have a high confidence AI answer that they cannot quality. At any point, AI answers aren't a challenge for people who are confidence enough in the craft to ask more qualified questions and determine honesty from the resulting nonverbal signals. reply",

          "text": "Leetcode style questions no longer work. If it's solvable with a few functions within 1 hour, AI will solve it in 5 minutes. If the job is cutting trees, you can't measure them by how long they take to cut a tree, but whether they have stamina to cut through multiple trees. Take home assignments work, and the good news is they can be shorter now. 1 day or 4 hours of work is enough of a benchmark. Something like a Wordle clone is about the right level of complexity. Things we look for: 1. Do they use a library? Some people are a bit egoistic about doing things the easy way. GenAI will make a list of words, which is both wasteful and incomplete when they can find a dictionary of words. Do they cut down the dictionary to the right size? It should only be the words not definitions. 2. Architecture? What do they normally use? How do the parts link to one another? How do they handle errors? 3. Do they bring in something new? AI will usually use a 5 year old tech stack unless you give it a specific one, because that's around the average of code it's trained on. If they're experienced enough to tell AI to use the new tech, they're probably experienced enough. 4. Require a starting commit (probably gitignore) and ask them to add reasonable sized commits. Classic coding should look a bit like painting. Vibe coding looks like sculpting, where you chip bits off. This will also catch more critical cheating, like someone else doing the work on their behalf - the commits may be from the wrong emails or you'll see massive commits where nothing gets chipped off. 5. There are going to be people who think AI is a nuisance. Tests like this will help you benchmark the different factions. But don't give them so much toil that it puts the AI users at a large advantage and don't give overly complex \"solved\" questions that the AI can just pull out from training. reply",

          "text": "We basically look for this: https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide It's similar across all mobile platforms. People call it MVVM, Bloc, MVP, etc. But we want to see the pattern of UI-repo-service and unidirectional data flow. This is three layers and it can be as little as 3 files. If someone can grasp that, it's good enough. There's not a lot of ways you can screw up hiring mobile devs; most skills are trainable. But this is what costs months. One guy once looped the viewmodel inside another viewmodel because he was using them as the data store and observable. He was let go but it took 2 years to remove everything he did from production even though he worked there for 3 months and most of it was via rewriting entire blocks of code. We watch for overengineering and perfectionism. Some people insist on more blocks or splitting it into modules. But can they do that in 4 hours? AI can write all of it easy enough, but it's just a 2-3x multiplier. Some assume it's an infinite multiplier and they can just subscribe to Cursor on the spot and it'll be done in a blink. But do the parts connect in the order given above? Also Wordle is not ideal for architecture, but it's good enough. It requires a solid understanding of the top level of things, and connection to the data layer. What if we switched the word source from the dictionary to the API? That's a bit more of an advanced test. An even more advanced test would be structuring it for TDD, which would need understanding of DI, factories, tests and gotchas, etc. I don't think this is doable even with AI yet though. As a UI test, Wordle is pretty good because you have all your logic and variables on one layer and display it via a different, more complex layer. reply",

          "text": "Hey! Creator of stealthinterview.ai here. After working for 15 years at FAANG, startups and no-name companies, I have conducted more than a 100 interviews for all levels, mostly in engineering. In my experience with technical interviews specifically, there are 4 types of candidates: - the memorizer\n- the mathematical brain\n- the project builder\n- the coding enthusiast that knows a language well but can’t do algorithms Most of the time, I have encountered candidates in buckets 3 and 4. Many showed debugging skills, communication skills, but lacked the right answer to trapping rainwater. I was told to reject candidates who couldn’t pass these problems mainly on the grounds of solved or not solved, even if they clearly communicated. The only reason I got into FAANG companies myself is because I was the good memorizer. I couldn’t solve most of these problems today without months of prep. At the end, I left my FAANG job recently because I realized it’s going to be the same or worse at any other company, because internally it’s all the same B.S. once you make it in. Sure, you’ll get a fat salary, but it’s a slow grind. Instead, I chose to build things. Is the interview process today bad? I think so. What can candidates do about it? Take it in their own hands and play the game or get played. What is the alternative? Depends. There are many companies that don’t do crazy algorithm interviews and pay really well. In my opinion, if you are hiring hundreds of engineers per year, take-home assessments and reviewing them is literally a job on its own. Making candidates build apps from scratch and deploy it, test it, present it? Maybe, but certainly opinionated, not binary. New grads don’t have experience, but experienced engineers do. You shouldn’t need to ask people with 10 years of experience about trapping rainwater from LC. There are so many other things to ask, discuss, and gauge experience, scope and depth. reply",

This is the same type of test as the takehome tests that a lot of companies give, where you can use google or stack overflow previously to do research. If I was hiring for my own project and needed people that can problem solve, I would be asking more involved questions that LLMs could not solve, because LLMS will give you just the standard most commonly used solution.

          "text": "I strongly believe technical interviews should try to mirror a pair programming session on a problem as if it was work, rather than a quiz or interrogation type format. If someone asked during such a session (where it's cameras, screenshare) that they wanted to do something like google some documentation, I wouldn't see that as a problem. Obviously it's a problem if someone just googles for a solution and pastes it in. I see LLMs in the same way. No issue with them using it do something like take the pseudo code they wrote in front of me and turned it into an implementation. Especially if they could talk through this code and make suggestions about further changes and so on, clearly showing they understand what's going on. The real concern is going to be when sophisticated agents can impersonate (clone voice and video) in a convincing way, as well as the capabilities to see the screen and type away as if it was a real person, and they're responding to you in real time. If the software is based on the models made by large companies, they'll be happy to give you recipes. They would refuse if the coding request mentioned something about cracking passwords or dumping credit cards. And all of them will have a meltdown if you try to ask them to say something politically incorrect (what a bizarre world that would be if that became the new captcha system for humans trying to figure out if they're wasting their time with a fake human). That said, this is going to be a cat and mouse game. There will be nothing to stop people from fine tuning models to get around being \"jailbreaked\" to reveal themselves as LLMs. Perhaps the best means is taking the time to research problems that causes \"vibe coding\" to completely fall down. And that is likely going to be things that are novel and haven't been littered all over the internet. That has a knock on effect of making such interviews a bit more interesting for the people doing them too. reply",

If anything, it slightly depressed my mood. I don't have depression. - Supplementing with good quality fish oil and magnesium daily has made pretty noticeable differences. Currently, this is Sports Research Triple Strength Fish Oil. It has the right mix of whatever oils -- I'd need to go look in my notes to elaborate. Most off the shelf pills (including Kirkland) are inadequate in quality. For magnesium, I am currently taking Doctor's Best High Absorption Magnesium Glycinate Lysinate.

Otherwise, DO NOT take anxiety medication. The side effects can be horrific for your health and you will become dependent on it for daily functioning. See a doctor to be sure. Changes to diet can help. Try a low carb diet and drop alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. A low carb diet will focus on mostly meat, dairy, and vegetables. Cardio and weight training will also help. Focus on exercises that increase bone density. Not only does this kind of diet improve your mental health it improves nearly all chronic health problems. In my case it has almost reversed and eliminated arthritis. Just remember a job is a job. They are disposable. You aren’t a celebrity or senior executive so don’t let it interfere with your health.

          "text": "The ACT approach worked for me. It's compatible with CBT, but with a different emphasis. The following names may help: Claire Weekes, who somebody else in this thread recommended. She's the pioneer of the approach. She wrote mainly in the mid-20th century but her work is still accessible. Also look at Kevin Majeres' work, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGa-jQJazpY Also look at the DARE Approach to anxiety: https://www.youtube.com/@DareResponse They all say variations of the same thing, which is that you need to train your brain not to fear your anxiety. This approach ought to be the standard -- it really works, and is well-demonstrated in the literature. Also exercise every day, or as often as you can. Both weight-training and cardio are good. Swimming is excellent. Don't spend much time analysing some deep-seated reason for your anxiety. A little bit is fine, but going too deep is a waste of time, and can actually make it worse. You want to train the rational part of your brain to disregard the anxiety signals coming from your amygdla; and over time, the amygdla's messages will become less and less intense. If you spend time thinking 'why why why am I feeling this way?', your brain starts treating the anxiety signals as important, which is the opposite of what you want. I would strongly recommend against changing careers. You will not be making good decisions while anxious, and other careers will not be less stressful. reply",

          "text": "> code reviews, sprints and constant deadlines. Don't accept a job where teams do Scrum. Scrum is an anxiety-inducing never-ending marathon. If people without anxiety make it work for them, great - but it doesn't work for me, so I reject it. More broadly speaking, figure out if you have other boundaries you need to set, and make discovery of whether or not those boundaries would be crossed a part of any interview process. Decline jobs that cross them. I find that smaller companies outside of the startup world are better. Look for bootstrapped small software shops, or an internal IT department of a non-tech company. Find a place where you are helping the business run, but not directly producing the product that defines the business. Or work on enterprise platforms - Salesforce, SAP, etc. Such platforms tend to need work more along the lines of configuration, scripting, and data updates, which results in a different type and pace of work. reply",

Most solutions attempt to be  a cookie-cutter which fits all. Anxiety is body's natural response to an environment. Your job was not the problem. \nHow you thought you were supposed to work - was the real activator. Even if you find a healthy job, you will yearn that \"high\" from the stress. Once anxiety is part of you, no medication or meditation can make it just disappear. It will be carried in your genes. You are may be carrying it from your grand grand parents too . Good news is that you dont have to be affected by your anxiety. If you learn to accept it as part of your natural response, you will calm it down . Use a good meditation app - not the Silicon Valley ones. You may try various therapies to see what you like. But avoid professionals. The answer does not require you to spend 1$. Even the richest may not treat anxiety in their lives. More money you spend, worse it may get for you. reply",

It will really help me out. I think all devs hate Jira boards and being judged on how many points they score each sprint. Estimating things well is extremely hard so even great devs sometimes don't finish sprints well - which causes unnecessary angst if your boss is the kind of guy that gives a hard time over something like this. There is no magic bullet here - I think the most important thing is a sympathetic boss who you connect with and who doesn't pressure you constantly. How were your previous bosses? > I do want meaningful work—I don't want to pick my nose all day. But I need a less demanding environment. All I see on LinkedIn are \"fast-moving\" startup roles. Are there any slower paced web dev jobs? Yes, for sure. These roles exist, especially in non software first companies and/or big legacy systems. Banking, insurance, manufacturing etc etc. The odds are the pace would be slower. > The only other option is to change career within or outside of software. I have no ideas here, and to be honest, this is rather frightening. I'd be curious to hear what others have done. Who doesn't entertain this thought here and there, even people who love software development can get fatigued after 10 years. \nI have no idea too ; I'm thinking I have no idea I'll even be able to remain employed 5 years from now with the pace AI is advancing at, but that's a different discussion. Anyway to recap - key to job longevity is your direct boss that's the most important thing. higher chances of slower pace in legacy or non software businesses. Second career is something most of us think about and I don't have a solution either - but I think getting fired once or even twice doesn't mean at all you have no way of succeeding in your next role. It just means you had one bad role. Good luck and take care! reply",

          "text": "Hi teleforce, thanks! Your project sounds very interesting as well. That actually reminds me, at one point, a researcher suggested looking into geophone or fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data that oil companies sometimes collect in Alaska, potentially for tracking animal movements or impacts, but I never got the chance to follow up. Connecting seismic activity data (like yours) with potential effects on animal vocalizations or behaviour observed in acoustic recordings would be an interesting research direction! Regarding data access: Our labeled dataset (EDANSA, focused on specific sound events) is public here: https://zenodo.org/records/6824272 . We will be releasing an updated version with more samples soon. We are also actively working on releasing the raw, continuous audio recordings. These will eventually be published via the Arctic Data Center (arcticdata.io). If you'd like, feel free to send me an email (address should be in my profile), and I can ping you when that happens. Separately, we have an open-source model (with updates coming) trained on EDANSA for predicting various animal sounds and human-generated noise. Let me know if you'd ever be interested in discussing whether running that model on other types of non-stationary sound data you might have access to could be useful or yield interesting comparisons. reply",

          "text": "Hi d_burfoot, really appreciate you bringing that up! The idea of pre-training a big foundation model on our raw data using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (kind of like how GPT emerged in NLP) is definitely something we've considered and experimented with using transformer architectures. The main hurdle we've hit is honestly the scale of relevant data needed to train such large models from scratch effectively. While our ~19.5 years dataset duration is massive for ecoacoustics, a significant portion of it is silence or ambient noise. This means the actual volume of distinct events or complex acoustic scenes is much lower compared to the densely packed information in the corpora typically used to train foundational speech or general audio models, making our effective dataset size smaller in that context. We also tried leveraging existing pre-trained SSL models (like Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT for speech), but the domain gap is substantial. As you can imagine, raw ecoacoustic field recordings are characterized by significant non-stationary noise, overlapping sounds, sparse events we care about mixed with lots of quiet/noise, huge diversity, and variations from mics/weather. This messes with the SSL pre-training tasks themselves. Predicting masked audio doesn't work as well when the surrounding context is just noise, and the data augmentations used in contrastive learning can sometimes accidentally remove the unique signatures of the animal calls we're trying to learn. It's definitely an ongoing challenge in the field! People are trying different things, like initializing audio transformers with weights pre-trained on image models (ViT adapted for spectrograms) to give them a head start. Finding the best way forward for large models in these specialized, data-constrained domains is still key. Thanks again for the suggestion, it really hits on a core challenge! reply",

          "text": "oh man that's awesome. I have been working for quite some time on big taxonomy/classification models for field research, espec for my old research area (pollination stuff). the #1 capability that I want to build is audio input modality, it would just be so useful in the field-- not only for low-resource (audio-only) field sensors, but also just as a supplemental modality for measuring activity out of the FoV of an image sensor. but as you mention, labeled data is the bottleneck. eventually I'll be able to skirt around this by just capturing more video data myself and learning sound features from the video component, but I have a hard time imagining how I can get the global coverage that I have in visual datasets. I would give anything to trade half of my labeled image data for labeled audio data! reply",

          "text": "Hi Caleb, thanks for the kind words and enthusiasm! You're absolutely right, audio provides that crucial omnidirectional coverage that can supplement fixed field-of-view sensors like cameras. We actually collect images too and have explored fusion approaches, though they definitely come with their own set of challenges, as you can imagine. On the labeled audio data front: our Arctic dataset (EDANSA, linked in my original post) is open source. We've actually updated it with more samples since the initial release, and getting the new version out is on my to-do list. Polli.ai looks fantastic! It's genuinely exciting to see more people tackling the ecological monitoring challenge with hardware/software solutions. While I know the startup path in this space can be tough financially, the work is incredibly important for understanding and protecting biodiversity. Keep up the great work! reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

          "text": "While all well and true. Some scale is assumed. There’s plenty of need for basic use invoicing like this. Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else. This project is being very transparent about what it does and how it works, which should help you out if you have a requirements list to compare it to. reply",

Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. I find this hard to believe. An invoice is a request for payment. A receipt is proof/confirmation of payment. Invoices sometimes double as receipts (or rather the other way around) when the payment is made immediately. But how can a country not have something that represents a formal request for payment by some future time? I don't even understand this from an accounting perspective.

There are plenty countries where the vendor will charge the account of the customer, like a 'pull' mechanism. In many countries they'll use (or used) checks/cheques for that, or a different payment account like a credit card. The agreement for this would have been a contract. They may still use invoices for larger transactions, but they aren't always required by law. I remember that in the old days, Google, Stripe, etc wouldn't send invoices, sometimes you'd get a minimal receipt message by email, but that was about it. This was particularly annoying for EU-based companies where there are minimal requirements for invoices and/or receipts. Times have changed though. Most companies, including US-based, will now offer invoices that comply with most international regulations. Except PayPal of course, for some reason they still seem to get away with not offering invoices.

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system. [1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me [2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree.

They might do okay, even pretty well, at combat maps and/or character sheets, but I want is the whole game world in the computer. Maps are just a fraction of what I need as a GM. I need data on economics and population numbers and power structures. And I need computation over all those things. For instance, my game rules include an economic subsystem, which takes in the production of goods and services at hundreds of in-game cities, and computes prices for over a thousand player-purchaseable goods. The \"second app\" that I referred to above allows players to (among many other things) purchase stuff at the market nearest their current location and have those items go straight into their character sheet. If the \"item\" is actually an animal, a hired mercenary, etc. then a different subsystem generates a new NPC with the right statistics and attaches the player to it as owner/liege. I could write an extension for a VTT that talks to my economic system over an API, and throws items up on screen, lets players purchase them, moves them into their character sheet using the right function calls in the VTT's extension library, etc. But every step of the way, I would be fighting to cram this subsystem into the VTT's conception that gameplay begins and ends with maps and char sheets. reply",

For example, one customer is Tetra Pak, that sells machines that build packaging (milk, juice, etc). These machines are like a two-story building with many variations, every aspect has to be well-defined and validated before it's ordered. In our solution products can be modeled in detail with constraints, and during a sale options are chosen and validated, often visualized parametrically, pricing is done, and a quote is prepared. All based on the well-defined model. It's a 30-year old company that started as a research startup, grew organically, and has a stable customer base. After a recent acquisition it's aiming to grow, therefore many positions are open. I started working here just a year ago, but I can say the work environment is healthy and relaxed, lots of competent people and everyone I interacted with so far have been very nice and professional.

We sell d2c and are doing £300k-£500k monthly sales (lots of toys and reasonably seasonal). I built most the initial systems which run the company’s backend (purchasing, databases, pipelines etc.) but we will need something (and someone!) better to reach £1bn+ sales over the next four years We need to go from a bunch of bash scripts coordinated by systemd, adhoc estimators and pipelines to a more coherent machine for demand estimation, matching products, warehousing and purchasing. You’ll be mostly writing code (django+postgre+a hetzner server) but also helping our two more junior devs. The vision for the company is twofold: (1) find 1000s of suppliers and wholesalers worldwide and (2) to ingest all their pricing, logistics and then move stock to where prices and demand is highest.

You will be the first engineer outside of the founding team. Here is a bit more about us: We're a seed stage AI startup backed by several top tier VCs. We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI. We use AWS, K8s, React, and Rust but there is no requirement to have prior experience with them specifically. We'll teach you! We are a founding team made up of ex-YC, Amazon, Meta, and Harvard Business School with previous successful exits. We also have a 6+ month customer waitlist! We're hiring our first engineer outside the founders. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, design the right solution, and build from zero to one. You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity. We care about slope, not where you are today. This is an opportunity to work in an insanely fast paced, high ownership environment while solving real problems in healthcare. We're happy to share more details on the role in person/on zoom. Please fill out this form if interested! https://wgwx7h7be0p.typeform.com/to/LV0t8OjI reply",

Like many companies, we are trying to separate the real value of the latest AI techniques and tools from the hype (agents?), and unlocking use cases that actually benefit our customers. This role is a rather generalist role for someone with a strong ML background, 2+ years of work experience (post schooling), and a desire to work on both proof of concept and production systems. You would be joining our small AI/ML team as we continue to automate as much as possible and enable new product features and use cases. FinQuery makes software to help companies comply with new lease accounting regulations, manage financial contracts, and keep track of recurring and one-off payments. We're based in Atlanta, but support fully remote employees in the US. This is an IC role. https://finquery.com/careers/ We are also hiring for roles in DevOps, marketing, and more. reply",

There's no gap between training and inference-- train at the edge, learn all the time. With our framework we increase training efficiency and also combine the static pre-trained intelligence from LLMs with continuous training to learn local contexts.

          "text": "Layer | Full stack & Backend Engineering | San Francisco | https://layerfi.com We believe SMBs are the backbone of American society and small business ownership is the best path to wealth creation and economic mobility for many Americans. We're trying to dramatically lower the activation energy in just one of the major hurdles for aspiring small business owners: accounting and bookkeeping. Our approach is working! We embed directly within an SMB's primary business platform, manage all the data syncing & reconciliation for them, and have real humans (with real AI tooling) handling their books. We do this at ~half the cost of existing bookkeeping services and it's still profitable for us because we're saving so much time with our data access + AI. Adoption is taking off faster even faster than we hoped and we need to grow the team! We're a team of 5 who like working with a high ownership and high throughput collaboration. We have serious technical challenges across scaling systems, data modeling, and building AI-driven automations of tedious tasks. Our hiring philosophy is simple. 1. The early engineering team isn't just building products, it's setting the culture, practices, and standards for the whole org. Find teammates who have the appetite and agency to go beyond excellent code. 2. No one knows more than 10% of what they need to be successful at an early stage startup. Find teammates with the highest trajectory of learning and growth and give them as much opportunity and responsibility as they want. 3. We talk to real small businesses with real problems every single day. Find teammates who want to win by making our customers successful day in and day out.

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

          "text": "I frequently recommend Wix to freelance clients who just need a basic site. Once they set it up, it basically keeps going for years and years, which is not true of most other stacks, including Wordpress. It's an easy service from a single vendor, so no need to deal with different hosting/CDN/SSL/etc providers. I think it's a wonderful thing for clients with simpler needs. The benefit for clients is that they can pay you once, for a few hours, to help them set it up (if they even need that)... and then they basically don't need you anymore. I've \"lost\" several happy clients this way, but I'd rather they just use that service than waste their money on a developer they don't really need. It's very easy to use, reliable, and cheap. And they have a single vendor to go for any sort of support they might need for their website. In contrast to many of the over-engineered Next.js or Gatsby sites I've seen, Wix is far, FAR easier to maintain and I get pretty much zero complaints about it after initial setup. All the other stacks I've ever made for clients, whether they were in Next, React, Angular, vanilla HTML, Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, other CMSes... all became a maintenance headache after 2-3 years, and usually obsolete, unusable, and completely rewritten within 4-5. Not so with the Wix sites; they just keep going year after year and the client never worries about it again, logging in to post an occasional update every week or so but otherwise letting it do its thing. I wouldn't choose to use it for a personal project anything more advanced than a personal blog or a very simple marketing site. But it's fine for what it is, and the web is better off for having services like this for regular people to choose from. Not everything needs a super-heavy JS frontend. reply",

You can transfer the domains away or to them like any other registrar. This means that the customer \"owns\" it for the period of time it is registered for with an accredited registrar. The web builder companies do not own it on your behalf. There are no real SEO penalties, but as with any web property, you have to do the work to get all the SEO working as you want. As far as benefits for developers, give me an open source tool any day that I can improve on, extend, or mess up with sketchy coding. These tools are meant for consumers to build their own sites for the most part. They represent the initial commodification of \"get a website\". They are more difficult and/or expensive to extend than a tool like WordPress, Laravel, Hugo, etc. And they are walled gardens, which means they are difficult to migrate away from. reply",

          "text": "There is more than one way to answer this. They have made an alternative to the CUDA language with HIP, which can do most of the things the CUDA language can. You could say that they haven't released supporting libraries like cuDNN, but they are making progress on this with AiTer for example. You could say that they have fragmented their efforts across too many different paradigms but I don't think this is it because Nvidia also support a lot of different programming models. I think the reason is that they have not prioritised support for ROCm across all of their products. There are too many different architectures with varying levels of support. This isn't just historical. There is no ROCm support for their latest AI Max 395 APU. There is no nice cross architecture ISA like PTX. The drivers are buggy. It's just all a pain to use. And for that reason \"the community\" doesn't really want to use it, and so it's a second class citizen. This is a management and leadership problem. They need to make using their hardware easy. They need to support all of their hardware. They need to fix their driver bugs. reply",

NVIDIA while far from perfect has always easily kept stride in software quality ahead of AMD for over 20 years.  While AMD repeatedly keeps falling on their face and getting egg all over themselves again and again and again as far as software goes.

          "text": "This is correct but one of the reasons is the SWE at HW companies are living in their own bubble. They somehow don't follow the rest of the SW developments. I'm a chip design engineer and I get frustrated with the garbage SW/FW team come up with, to the extent that I write my own FW library for my blocks. While doing that I try to learn the best practices, do quite a bit of research. One other reason is, SW was only FW till not long ago, which was serving the HW. So there was almost no input from SW to HW development. This is clearly changing but some companies, like Nvidia, are ahead of the pack. Even Apple SoC team is quite HW centric compared to Nvidia. reply",

          "text": "It is a little bit more complicated than ROCm simply not having support because ROCm has at a point claimed support, and they've had to walk it back painfully (multiple times). Its not a driver issue, nor a hardware issue on their side. There has been a long-standing issue between AMD and its mainboard manufacturers. The issue has to do with features required for ROCm, namely PCIe Atomics. AMD has been unable or unwilling to hold the mainboard manufacturers to account for advertising features the mainboard does not support. The CPU itself must support this feature, but the mainboard must as well (in firmware). One of the reasons why ROCm hasn't worked in the past is because the mainboard manufacturers have claimed and advertised support for PCIe Atomics, and the support they've claimed has been shown to be false, and the software fails in non-deterministic ways when tested. This is nightmare fuel for the few AMD engineers tasked with ROCm. PCIe Atomics requires non-translated direct IO to operate correctly, and in order to support the same CPU models from multiple generations they've translated these IO lines in firmware. This has left most people that query their system to check this showing PCIAtomics is supported, while when actual tests that rely on that support are done they fail, in chaotic ways. There is no technical specification or advertising that the mainboard manufacturers provide showing whether this is supported. Even the boards with multiple x16 slots and the many technologies related to it such as Crossfire/SLI/mGPU brandings these don't necessarily show whether PCIAtomics is properly supported. In other words, the CPU is supported, the firmware/mainboard fail with no way to differentiate between the two at the upper layers of abstraction. All in all. You shouldn't be blaming AMD for this. You should be blaming the three mainboard manufacturers who chose to do this. Some of these manufacturers have upper end boards where they actually did do this right they just chose to not do this for any current gen mainboard costing less than ~$300-500. reply",

And CUDA cores are just what Nvidia call their normal shader cores. Pretty much every subunit on a geforce has a direct equivalent on a radeon - they might be faster/slower or more/less capable, but they're there and often at an extremely similar level of the design. AMD also have on-die microcontrollers (multiple, actually) that do things like scheduling or pipeline management, again just like Nvidia's GSP. It's been able to schedule new work on-GPU with zero host system involvement since the original GCN, something that Nvidia advertise as \"new\" with them introducing their GSP (which just replaced a slightly older, slightly less capable controller rather than being /completely/ new too) The problem is that AMD are a software follower right now - after decades of under-investment they're behind on the treadmill just trying to keep up, so when the Next Big Thing inevitably pops up they're still busy polishing off the Last Big Thing. I've always seen AMD as a hardware company, with the \"build it and they will come\" approach - which seems to have worked for the big supercomputers who likely find it worth investing in their own modified stack to get that last few %, but clearly falls down selling to \"mere\" professionals. Nvidia, however, support the same software APIs on even the lowest end hardware, while nobody is likely running much on their laptop's 3050m in anger, it offers a super easy on-ramp for developers - and it's easy to mistake familiarity with superiority - you already know to avoid the warts so you don't get burned by them. And believe me, CUDA has plenty of warts. And marketing - remember \"Technical Marketing\" is still marketing - and to this day lots of people believe that the marketing name for something, or branding a feature, implies anything about the underlying architecture design - go to an \"enthusiast\" forum and you'll easily find people claiming that because Nvidia call their accelerator a \"core\" means it's somehow superior/better/\"more accelerated\" than the direct equivalent on a competitor, or actually believe that it just doesn't support hardware video encoding as it \"Doesn't Have NVENC\" (again, GCN with video encoding was released before a Geforce with NVENC). Same with branding - AMD hardware can already read the display block's state and timestamp in-shader, but Everyone Knows Nvidia Introduced \"Flip Metering\" With Blackwell! reply",

          "text": "I want to argue that graphics cards are really 3 markets: integrated, gaming (dedicated), and compute. Not only do these have different hardware (fixed function, ray tracing cores, etc.) but also different programming and (importantly) distribution models. NVIDIA went from 2 to 3. Intel went from 1 to 2, and bought 3 (trying to merge). AMD started with 2 and went to 1 (around Llano) and attempted the same thing as NVIDIA via GCN (please correct me if I'm wrong). My understanding is that the reason is that the real market for 3 (GPUs for compute) didn't show up until very late, so AMD's GCN bet didn't pay off. Even in 2021, NVIDIA's revenue from gaming was above data center revenue (a segment they basically had no competition in, and 100% of their revenue was from CUDA). AMD meanwhile won the battle for Playstation and Xbox consoles, and was executing a turnaround in data centers with EPYC and CPUs (with Zen). So my guess as to why they might have underinvested is basically: for much of the 2010s they were just trying to survive, so they focused on battles they could win that would bring them revenue. This high level prioritization would explain a lot of \"misexecution\", e.g. if they underhired for ROCm, or prioritized APU SDK experience over data center, their testing philosophy (\"does this game work ok? great\"). reply",

Nvidia can afford to develop a comprehensive software platform for the compute market segment because it has a comprehensive share of that segment. AMD cannot afford it because it does not have the market share. Or to put it another way, I assume that AMD's efforts are motivated rational economic behavior and it has not been economically rational to compete heavily with Nvidia  in the compute segment. AMD was able to buy ATI because ATI could not compete with Nvidia. So AMD's graphics business started out trailing Nvidia. AMD has had a viable graphics strategy without trying to beat Nvidia...which makes sense since the traditional opponent is Intel and the ATI purchase has allowed AMD to compete with them pretty well. Finally, most of the call for AMD to develop a CUDA alternative is based on a desire for cheaper compute.

People pay the price hand over fist, because there simply isn't equivalent hardware to compete with. It's practically a steal for certain HPC customers that want the latest and greatest out of TSMC. I agree with both your comment and the parent comment - serious competition could spell the end for CUDA's dominance. But there will never be serious competition, CUDA has the head-start and their competitors threw in the towel with OpenCL. Khronos can't get Apple to sign onto a spec and they can't get AMD to change their architecture - open GPGPU compute is stuck in neutral while Nvidia is shifting into 6th gear. Reality is that Nvidia could charge cloud-level margins and get away with it, because Apple is the only other TSMC customer with equivalent leverage and they pretend the server market doesn't exist. reply",

If you hang out in the tinygrad discord, you can see this happening in real time. > those I have talked to say they depend on a lot more than just one or two key libraries. Theres a ton of libraries out there yes, but if we're talking about python and the libraries in question are talking to GPUs its going to be exceedingly rare that theyre not using one of these under the hood: pytorch, tensorflow, jax, keras, et al. There are of course exceptions to this, particularly if you're not using python for your ML work (which is actually common for many companies running inference at scale and want better runtime performance, training is a different story). But ultimately the core ecosystem does work just fine with AMD GPUs, provided you're not doing any exotic custom kernel work.

This might seem small, but both projects have a larger people footprint than most tech companies' headcount that are operating at significant scale. On top of that, consider that pytorch is a project with its origins at Meta, and Meta has internal teams that spend 100% of their time supporting the project. Coupled with the fact that Meta just purchased nearly 200k units worth of AMD inference gear (MI300X), there is a massive groundswell of tech effort being pushed in AMD's direction. > wouldn't AMD just invest in doing this themselves, or at least provide much more support to these guys? That was actually the point of George Hotz's \"cultural test\" (as he put it). He wanted to see if they were willing to part with some expensive gear in the spirit of enabling him to help them with more velocity. And they came through, so I think that's a win no matter which lens you analyze this through. Since resources are finite, especially in terms of human capital, there's only so much to go around. AMD naturally can now focus more on the software closer to the metal as a result, namely the driver. They still have significant stability issues in that layer they need to overcome, so letting the greater ML community help them shore up the deltas in other areas is great. reply",

And, frankly, AMD has lately been doing a great job at its core business. The problem is that GPUs are now much more profitable than CPUs, both in terms of unit economics and growth potential. So they are winning a major battle (against Intel) even as they are losing a different one (against nVidia). I'm not sure there's a strategy they could have adopted to win both at the same time. However, the next big looming problem for them is likely to be the shrinking market for x86 vs. the growing market for Arm etc. So they might very well have demonstrated great core competence, that ends up being completely swept away by not just one but two major industry shifts. reply",

          "text": "There’s this popular pastime lately where people pretend to be the last rational mind on Earth while making blanket pronouncements about tech they don’t understand. >“Avoid it! Perplexity rules prohibit commercial use…” Cool story, but also: irrelevant. Nobody serious is shipping products on Perplexity as a backend. It’s a research tool with a nice wrapper. The people building with LLMs are using OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Groq, and Ollama, depending on the constraints and goals. Acting like the existence of one walled garden invalidates an entire paradigm is like saying cars are bad because golf carts can’t go on highways. > “ChatGPT rules prohibit sharing the output with other AI…” There are some restrictions, yes. And that matters… if your use case is literally just shuttling model output between APIs like a glorified message broker. Most developers are fine with this because they’re building systems, not playing telephone. > “They’re training on everything you pass in…” This is just flat wrong. OpenAI doesn’t train on API input/output unless you explicitly opt in. The fact that this myth is still circulating tells me people are repeating each other instead of reading the docs. > “You’re paying to get brain raped…” If your argument requires dehumanizing metaphors to land, you don’t have an argument. You have trauma cosplay. > “Coding with OpenAI = being a sheep…” This is the kind of thing people say when they’ve never delivered software in production. The tools either help or they don’t. Calling people sheep for using powerful tools is anti-intellectualism dressed up as cynicism. Nobody’s building a search engine from scratch to prove they’re not a sheep either. We use leverage. That’s the whole game. > “You’re paying them to train their model to imitate you…” Actually, no — again, unless you opt in. But even if that were true, you’re also trading that data for time saved, features shipped, and workflows unlocked. You know, ROI. > “Better off learning a better (compiled) programming language…” I have nothing against compiled languages, but this is like telling someone struggling with Figma that they should learn Blender. It might be good advice in a vacuum, but it doesn’t help you win the game that’s actually being played. > “Why pay OpenAI for the privilege to help them take your job?” You could’ve said the same thing about AWS. Or GitHub. Or Stack Overflow. Or even programming itself, in the mainframe era. Gatekeeping based on purity is a waste of time. The actual work is understanding what AI can do, what it shouldn’t do, and when to lean in. > “Why outsource mental activity to a service with a customer noncompete?” You’re not outsourcing thinking. You’re compressing cognitive overhead. There’s a difference. If you think using AI is “outsourcing thinking,” you were probably outsourcing thinking to Stack Overflow and Copilot already. ⸻ Look, are there risks? Costs? Vendor lock-in traps? Of course. Anyone seriously building with AI right now is absorbing all that volatility and pushing forward anyway, because the upside is that massive. Dismissing the entire space as a scam or a trap is either willful ignorance or fear masquerading as intellectual superiority. If you don’t want to use AI tools, don’t. But don’t throw rocks from the sidelines at the people out there testing edge cases, logging failures, bleeding tokens, and figuring out what’s possible. reply",

No matter what, the current paradigm is the \"mixture of experts\", aka defining roles and then switching between the roles.  In the case of Aider, you're mainly looking at \"architect\" and \"code\".  Others like Cline/Roo provide also this, but more limitations and access to MCP.  Honestly, I would avoid these more advanced tools until you get an understanding for how everything works. Begin with your \"architect\" and agree on a design, then act as an engineering manager to guide your \"code\" model to implement the tests.  Once you have a full test suite, make sure that you can use commands like `/lint` and `/test` to call  your toolchain as needed. I personally prefer this method (again, when you're getting started) because it's independent of every IDE and will work anywhere you have a terminal.  After you get comfortable, you'll quickly want to use a more advanced tool to trade your money for the time of the machine(s).  When you get to that point you'll understand what the fuss is about. reply",

After experimenting with various documentation approaches, I've had the best results using MECE principles (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to organize project knowledge. For Python/data engineering specifically, creating clear category boundaries between data models, transformation logic, and validation rules makes the LLM much more likely to generate code that follows your architectural patterns. The key is treating documentation as a \"context API\" for the AI rather than just human-readable text. When your documentation has a clear hierarchical structure without overlaps or gaps, the LLM can navigate the problem space much more effectively. reply",

It seems like it's just overloading the standard vscode UI, with no regard for what you're used to. Trying to press tab for what looks like a \"normal\" autocomplete will invoke the LLM autocomplete that will replace a bunch of lines somewhere else without you noticing. Terrible UX! Modifications made by the chat interface are also hard to restrict to a specific part. Sure, you can give it context, but asking it to modify one thing (by highlighting a bunch of rows in a specific file and giving them as context) is likely to end up modifying a similar-looking thing somewhere else. The potential is there with Cursor, but right now it's a mess for serious use. Waiting for editors that incorporate LLM-based autocomplete in a disciplined way where I'll actually feel like I'm the one in control. Maybe once the dumb hype around vibe coding dies down. reply",

          "text": "Here's my left-field pitch since everyone's shopping the A.IDEs - don't use them. The polish of Cursor et al is a component of its dishonesty. You should keep the nature of the tool exposed to you at all times. I say you should: - identify the things about your personal development process that you'd like to streamline (up to and including not having to code everything by hand) - write Python scripts that call LLMs (or don't!) to achieve the thing you want. - heck, write library functions and establish some neat patterns - a random prompt picker using a folder of txt files, why not? Not only can you create a development experience that approximates much of what Cursor does, you can make one that is twice as good for you because it is aligned with how you work, and how you think. And at that point, with your fluent new workflow, making a simple VSCode extension to hook into your scripts can't be all that hard. At that point, how can Cursor compete? reply",

          "text": "Admittedly, I’ve achieved so much with the assistance of extensions like Cline/Roo that I have a sort of youthful exuberance that wants to proclaim that the barrier to entry to building applications with AI is falling. It’s not. These tools will literally waste your time and empty your wallet if you don’t have a solid approach — and that starts with knowing how to detect code and architecture smells at light speed. These tools are writing code faster than you can read it so you better know what you’ve (actually) instructed it to do, and be able to monitor the quality in a 300ms glance or you’re hosed. Having said that, there are antidotes: 1. Use a memory-bank. A memory bank is a little folder where you instruct the agent to research upcoming tasks, store progress info, post gotchas, generate retrospectives and more. It’s super helpful if the thing you’re building is large and complex. 2. Instruct the agent to implement strict TDD/BDD principles and force it to follow a red-green-refactor workflow at a granular level. The downside to this is twice the code (read $tokens) per feature but you’ll spend it anyway when your agent has 600 lines of untested code written while you grabbed coffee and you come back to the agent stuck in a loop, spending $0.20 per request sending the same large files trying to figure out some syntax error between test and code files. 3. You need to know what you’re doing. The model/agent is not going to automatically apply second and third order thinking to look around systems design corners. It does exactly what you tell it to do (sometimes well) but you also have to always be considering what you forgot to tell it to do (or not to do). Prompt engineering is not natural language. It’s a form of spellweaving where you have to find the edges of all relevant forms of existence and non-existence, codify them into imperative language, add the right nuance to finesse the style and have the confidence to cast the spell — over and over and over again. 4. You need money. Building a serious endeavor with an AI agent will cost you around $400-600 a month. Leave room for lots of mistakes. Prepare for weeping and gnashing of teeth when the task counter hits $10.00, you’re like 20% done with the feature, the model has lost context about what it was doing and you have to choose between making a broken commit and hoping the agent can sort it out in a clean task, or eating the cost and starting over. I spent $50 on starting over just this past weekend. This is why I wrote numbers 1-3 above. I’m committed to figuring out where all the pitfalls are so others might not have to. I personally feel like anyone who’s doing this right now is really just burning some cash to see what’s possible. reply",

          "text": "My unfounded belief is that the environment is changing dramatically, and will continue to change. And not because of AI. The reason is that the current internet business model if depleted. Users are weary of the lack of reasonable stuff on the internet. Personally, I use my browser less and less each day. It has become, in my opinion, pretty much a wasteland. Given that situation, what can you do? One could just change careers. Or perhaps consider why things are this way. One path would be diagnose the current situation. Beginning with the predominant internet business model - tracking users. The number of obvious problems with this is large. I once read (not sure where) that the customer of the internet is advertisers, not users. Things will now quickly get worse in this version of the internet. The prey (users) will now be inundated with generated content. Yeah, yeah, I know this is dark and you don't want to read it. However, perhaps if we consider what it is possible to do with the internet if it wasn't so polluted there is quite a bright light. Fundamentally the internet provides an enhanced way for people to interact and communicate. There are indeed examples of this happening. I sometimes think We people are in a situation similar to a prehistoric culture that finds a steel axe. So we go around hacking everything in sight. But of course the thing about the axe is the metallurgy. Currently it appears to me that we have pretty much hacked everything to death with the internet and created a very nice waste land. Here's looking at you Google!!! So perhaps time to consider the equivalent of the metallurgy. reply",

          "text": "I run a small consulting shop in Germany, also specialising on PLM (and IoT) - I never landed a gig in the US. The problem with PLM is that more often than not you operate in high tech / defense and because of export control regulations you need residency. For getting projects in Europe, what worked for me is cold outreach on linkedin. However not directly for the end client (that really never worked) - but there are a lot of companies in between - medium size consulting shops / service integrators. Also digital strategy consulting shops sometimes realize in the middle of a project that they should better own the implementation themselves(because some other partner has been identified as unreliable or too expensive) \nA big aspect is being consistent and send a few messages per day. What also worked was applying to jobs, and after making the first contact breaking it to them that I actually run my own company but that I could solve the issue that they were trying to fix by hiring me. At last but not least - send me your CV to daniel a teide d tech - if you have experience with PTC's Windchill PLM there is a chance that I have work for you in the future. But also if not, it's always good to extend the network. I have worked in the past with freelancers from India, usually setting up legal/contractual aspects through deel.com Good luck! reply",

          "text": "A lot of other comments have touched on things well. My experience as a corporate is that I often find the 'US local' is a thin shell of sales/leadership, someone I feel I can hold accountable when I'm not getting results during the engagement, and the hands-on tactical folks on their team are typically globally dispersed. This has never been a hard sell for me internally to get approved. It's quite silly on our part because we end up paying $200/hr for resources that probably only see $30/hr of it; but finding a whole team of SME's in some Enterprise SW that are entirely US based can be quite difficult too. All said, you need to setup a US based sales office. Even if it's just optics, deflect and say you spend a lot of your time with the engineer's in India but come to States frequently for client meetings, then offer to fly to US for key points of the contract, etc. But, the key is making people think your operations is US based in the first-impression phase. reply",

An important part of being a VC appears to be the ability to believe anything, no matter how stupid, as long as it is currently on-trend, then to abandon it as if it had never existed when fashions change (for instance, see the blockchain craze, which was shortly followed by a distinct NFT craze that was just the blockchain one resprayed). I would not take what _VCs_ say as any particular guide to reality. > Even Bill Gates recently said we might all be out of work soon and won’t need to do anything in an \"age of abundance.\" This would be the same Bill Gates who was claiming in the late 90s that by the early noughties our primary means of interfacing with our computers would be by talking to them, yes?

          "text": "My personal opinion: It will be similar to how computers affected jobs. No jobs are safe, but no skilled jobs are immediately on the chopping block either. AI will boost peoples' efficiency, such that it will take one skilled worker to do what it used to take five skilled workers to do. Law briefs, ad copy, scripting, code refactoring, engineering. Everything will use AI as a tool, but AI won't replace most people. People will instruct AIs to do sub-tasks and validate and integrate its responses. Similar to how people use computers today. Some peoples' specialized skills will be rendered obsolete, similar to what happened with secretaries, switchboard operators, elevator operators, proofreaders, etc. with computers. I think it will change what it means to do many jobs, just like working with computers changed, for instance, accounting, or visual design. Working with specialized AI tools will become an essential part of many jobs, just like working with specialized software tools is today. Long term, I think AI will eat further into current jobs, but I think they will be replaced with different human jobs. I think there will still be skilled careers and roles to be had, but I don't think any of us can predict what those jobs will look like. reply",

          "text": "As someone who believes AI will completely eliminate humans I wish I was could only be worried about job security. But to answer your question, AI will ultimately eliminate every job in the sense that if you believe AI will eventually be able do any task, and do it for cheaper than a human labourer, then there would be no reason for you to ever pay a human labourer. The best analogy here is probably how the industrial revolution made the horse redundant. It's not that horses can't be used for physically demanding work anymore, it's simply that it's cheaper in practically every imaginable case to use a machine so horses are no longer used. Of course, machines didn't replace the use of horses in all industries over night and we should expect the same will happen with AI. I'll assume this is what you're asking. It seems rather obviously to me that knowledge workers will be the easiest to replace with AI – especially knowledge workers who work purely digitally. The hardest work to replace will likely be physical labour since robotics is still very far from biological sophistication required to be competent at many physical jobs. And even when it starts to become competent it's going to take a while to build the robots to replace labourers and do so at a competitive cost. reply",

          "text": "> \"age of abundance\" No such thing will come to pass in the common way you think. This is classic doublespeak. Similar to \"You will own nothing and be happy\". If you think hard on it, the only way that can be true is by limiting the scope of the number of people involved, and the only way to do that is if a large number of people die, and that is what they mean and intend when they do not explicitly spell out how you get from statement to reality, addressing the complex hidden dependencies. It is unlikely that any blue-collar job will be impacted aside from the 2nd order effects that occur as displaced workers move to other areas as a necessity for survival. That won't last long though before the monetary and economic systems break down as they will have more chaotic whipsaws than the labor market. As for how safe are other jobs. You can expect all white collar low complexity work, normally found in entry level positions on career ladders, and related support staff, to be at extreme risk. The upper echelon of senior positions, and even mid-level positions are safe, due to the abstract nature of the tasks required, but are confounded by additional costs being imposed by third-parties (i.e. ghost jobs/postings). There's no good way to evaluate you have this degree of experience/knowledge, and worse you lose this type of knowledge if you don't use it regularly. The career pipeline however is a sequential pipeline. If there is no one going into the pipeline because AI has blocked and replaced the entry-level worker as a surrogate, and there is no one for the mid and senior level people to pass knowledge to because they've all been replaced by an AI it won't happen, and as those mid and senior level people age out you find yourself in a hysteresis problem that cannot be solved in the time period needed. The same as any ponzi scheme. Three stages. The funding mechanism for almost all companies today ensures this is always a problem for next quarter, creating a cascading failure, or slow motion trainwreck of costs where the employer will be unable to find any labor meeting that criteria for any price by stage 3. If this happens in critical national dependencies then you get a full blown socio-economic collapse in an environment of ecological overshoot (Malthus/Catton) that is global in nature (via reserve currency). Not pretty, 1/3 of 4bn people might survive such, maybe, and that's as a global population. We've known how to build resilient systems for quite some time, but resilient systems cost more and in furtherance of globalization optimization has coincided towards brittle single-point-of-failures broadly. It allows the most chaos, which speculators and companies alike use to reap gross profits at everyone elses expense through plausible narratives backed by price fixing. reply",

Granted now is the wrong time to try to break into the industry given the NIH cuts. I was able to get a contracting position with university of pittsburgh and a free gig with CMU just by asking and that pays the bills but its not too much money. However if you don't already have publications you may have to wait until this chaos has wound down (honestly even if you do have publications it'll be hard to get paid until the chaos winds down I think I mostly just got very lucky). You can always get publications by working in a lab for free and have a real job simultaneously but that is a lot of work. There are also startups that have similar job descriptions. I worked for Signature Diagnostics for a year and a half and it was very bio/science heavy. But the key skill to break in is publications.

          "text": "If the dongle acts as a wifi AP with a DHCP server, it could give the iPhone an ip address but no gateway upon connection. This will cause the iPhone to talk directly to the dongle via the WiFi interface, but talk to the rest of the internet via the cellular connection. You can determine this by checking the WiFi network's properties after the connection is established. If there's no value in the \"Router\" field, that's how it works. Once you load the firmware update page, JavaScript on the page instructs the browser to fetch the firmware payload from a server on the public Internet, then relays that data to the dongle's web server to execute the firmware update process. As the other reply mentioned, this can be tricky, as CORS likes to prevent this kind of data transfer for security reasons, the right configuration on the web server will make it work. It's a fairly clever setup. If you want a low-tech way of confirming this design, try running the firmware update with a device that doesn't have two network connections, like a laptop, instead of a cell phone. If it doesn't work from such a device, the scenario I described above is probably how it works. reply",

          "text": "This is almost certainly the answer and clever as hell. You just have to make sure the server storing the firmware (which you control) has the right CORS headers (as you mention) and you are in business. This means that the CarPlay device has no \"internet\" (spoiler: it never had real internet access) unless you are on that page interacting with it. I'm not sure how these devices work, I mean I know they broadcast themselves as a CarPlay head unit then \"somehow\" pass that to the car via a wired connection (pretending to be a phone connecting via USB). \"somehow\" being the important part. Does it hand along an encrypted stream that it can't decode or does it decode/re-encode? Either way I'd bet these devices are pretty safe to use. The phone sends a video feed, not raw \"data\" so the MitM (again, if that's how it works) would need to OCR the video to get anything useful since the raw video would be too large to store and too heavy to transfer over cellular (via it's own hidden radio, again, worst-case-scenario). If the device decodes the stream in the middle then the worst case I can think of is it could be doing on-device OCR and cellular radio to exfiltrate the text but I feel confident that you could spot the cellular radio (or someone who did a teardown). Without the radio it has no way to get data off the device which means the best it could do it sneak some out while you were on that update screen. Though I think that's all pretty far-fetched. EDIT: I went looking for some way to act as a CarPlay receiver and get the raw video feed and it looks like it's possible [0] so yeah, a malicious device could proxy the connect, OCR the result, and send data via its own cellular connection but that would be relatively easy to detect and not worth it unless you are the target of a nation state which, at that point, you have bigger problems.

The car (and thus the dongle) just gets video and audio streams, not the actual textual content of your text messages, for example.  Sure, it could try to OCR the video and/or do voice recognition on the audio, but those are fairly computationally expensive.  And sending all that video to a remote server would be... a lot. reply",

If I have the opportunity to plug in outside the home, with a charging cable readily in front of, me, I'm gonna do it... just in case. I dunno, I still don't get it.  Wireless anything is always going to be significantly less reliable than wired, and I've heard enough stories of wireless CarPlay/AA flaking out (with dongles and built-in setups) to turn me off on it. Wireless is incredibly convenient when you don't have a wire and a port nearby, but that will essentially never be that case while you're in the car. reply",

Doesn't like pairing to multiple phones, and the phone doesn't like being plugged into one of the car's USB outlets (it drops the audio because AFAICT the phone thinks it's plugged into the car for audio, but the car is still expecting audio over the Bluetooth \"CarPlay\" connection), even if it's one of the outlets that's not supposed to do anything but power. I'd use it a little differently, but it's my wife's car, not mine. Who would have thought a 2022 Mercedes would have wired-only CarPlay? Anyway, I find it excellent for podcast control. If maps are off (in my case, because location services are turned off) it doesn't really use more power than plain Bluetooth audio, and when I approach my destination on a trip I'll turn on location and plug it in to juice up the last bit. reply",

Besides continuing the legacy of Toontown Online and bringing the MMO into the 21st Century, we also use our original IP to [raise funds for charities]( https://corporateclash.net/news/article/155 ) - we have raised over $54K for children's health and LGBTQ+ charities. We are on the lookout for a broad range of talents, from Tech to Art to Community Management! Everybody on the team is a volunteer - there is no salary, we do not solicit donations and all expenses are funded by our staff. We pride ourselves as being a training ground for up-and-coming talent to gain experience working on a real product in a 100+ strong team; some of our volunteers have used their experience with us to land jobs in and out of the industry. We have lots of interesting tech problems that arises from building on top of a 20+ year old codebase (yes, Toontown development started out on Python 2.0!). We are especially interested in people with an interest in distributed systems, system administration, game physics and automation pipelines! Our Tech Stack is varied: Python for the game, C++ for distributed networking services, JavaScript / TypeScript and some PHP for web. We're working on modernizing our tech stack to migrate away from PHP, and looking to introduce Rust (for Tauri / core networking) into our stack. You can see all of our positions and how to apply here (when emailing us, feel free to say HN): https://corporateclash.net/help/apply How much you want to contribute is up to you; our volunteers typically contribute 5-10 hours a week.

We accelerate and automate how software is built in the world's most important companies, including 7/10 top software companies by market cap and 4/6 top US banks. Every successful codebase becomes large and complex. Instead of improving the product, devs spend more of their time just understanding the code and doing low-level tasks. The solution is to accelerate humans doing what they're best at--and to automate the rest with AI agents, meaning more creativity and less toil for devs. Sourcegraph is the industrial software development platform, accelerating human devs with contextual AI and automating toil away with AI agents, and it's proven today in the world's most important companies.

On the fullstack side, we're building tools to apply our forecasts to automated battery storage optimization and energy volatility risk mitigation.

(Among the questions I asked were clarifications of very basic things like \"Am I supposed to be getting 404 errors when trying to query the links returned by the API the instructions say I should be rendering results from, or is there an issue with your backend?\" After having spent essentially two full days over the weekend on it, I emailed the night before we had agreed I'd complete the challenge to say that I wasn't interested in continuing with the interview process, and the next day I finally received a response saying something along the lines of \"oops, the engineer we said would answer your questions was on vacation, here's the email of a different one\". Obviously that's just one data point, but I wouldn't be shocked if their hiring portal worked fine and this is just how their recruiting works. reply",

One of our metrics is how little time you spend in the app. We're explicitly opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of 'traditional' dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation. We're monetizing intent! * We're top-tier VC funded, small team of 2 cofounders (Snapchat, Bumble), a CTO from Snap/Clubhouse, and 3 engineers, based in NYC. * Stack is Django, OpenAI, Flutter, Rust * Looking for a Mid-level Engineer who is an all-arounder. Backend more important than front-end code, but if can also work on client code (or want to learn) that would be ideal. * 1-2 days/week in person, in Brooklyn, and the rest remote.

The current e-commerce model leaves brands waiting for stock to arrive at the warehouse before they can start selling, leading to missed sales opportunities, unsold inventory and waste. We believe the next wave of innovation will happen in the time before stock arrives, enabling brands to sell inventory no matter where it is in the world. Our pre-commerce platform puts the power back in brands’ hands, allowing them to take control of their sales timelines and maximise revenue potential. And we make pre-orders trust worthy for the shoppers too, keeping their money in escrow until items ship, and always up to date on where their pre-order is at, with an option to cancel no questions asked. We've raised a $10m Series A in 2024, we've plenty of runway left and we're looking for help as we scale our platform through the next order of magnitude in terms of load on the system and ultimately the number of dollars we process. We are a team of 22 split evenly between the UK and US. 32% female, including the CEO. All of us have a mix of startup and big tech experience. For the founding team this is our second (so far :) successful startup. I have two engineering roles open: * senior full stack engineer - based in London, UK - to join our core engineering team of 6 that are shipping our product roadmap: https://purpledot.notion.site/senior-full-stack-engineer-uk * customer solutions engineer - based in New York, US - to work with our support and sales teams to help make going live with and using Purple Dot a delightful experience for brands and their shoppers: https://purpledot.notion.site/customer-solutions-engineer-us...

You will be the first engineer outside of the founding team. Here is a bit more about us: We're a seed stage AI startup backed by several top tier VCs. We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI. We use AWS, K8s, React, and Rust but there is no requirement to have prior experience with them specifically. We'll teach you! We are a founding team made up of ex-YC, Amazon, Meta, and Harvard Business School with previous successful exits. We also have a 6+ month customer waitlist! We're hiring our first engineer outside the founders. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, design the right solution, and build from zero to one. You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity. We care about slope, not where you are today. This is an opportunity to work in an insanely fast paced, high ownership environment while solving real problems in healthcare. We're happy to share more details on the role in person/on zoom. Please fill out this form if interested! https://wgwx7h7be0p.typeform.com/to/LV0t8OjI reply",

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

I'm a senior software developer/architect looking for interesting roles. I have been doing development for over 15 years, and have a wide range of skills and expertise. I specialize at seeing projects from conception through implementation and release, and have experience leading small development teams and projects as a lead developer, director, architect, and project manager. For the last few years I've mostly been in the Elixir and NodeJS/React spaces, building B2B and B2C projects in both. I'm very much a polyglot though, and have spent time in at least a half-dozen languages over my career. I have a lot of experience in the ministry and non-profit spaces as well. If you're interested in just consulting, I'd love to have a conversation there too. I work with a designer in creating highly creative and user-centric websites and applications. I'd love to have a conversation with you to see if we might be a good fit, either for employment, or for consulting. reply",

I've on many occasions had folks email me asking me why I put some of the things I do up for free on GitHub. All in all I've made around $17 in almost 10 years through donations (GitHub sponsorships). But I don't do it for the money, although I'll admit it would be nice to receive income for doing something you'd happily do for free anyways. I create almost all of my projects based on a personal need and the idea of openly sharing what I can is built into how I operate given how much I've learned from others, I feel very strongly about returning the favor when I can with no strings attached. reply",

          "text": "I’ll second this. It seems that a lot of people assume it’s possible (or easy?) to make a living from open-source projects. It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.  Most of my money has been from grants, one large donation from some rando anonymous person, and a nonprofit.

          "text": "If you’re aiming to be a \"rogue\" OSS contributor—essentially an independent developer thriving off open-source work—you’ll need a mix of strategy, skill, and visibility. Here’s how you can make it work: Bounties & Sponsored Issues – Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Bountysource, and Gitcoin offer paid opportunities to fix issues, build features, or improve security in open-source projects. Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "I am not an OSS contributor, so I have no personal experience whatsoever in this context. But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

Outside of company hours, I work on my personal streaming project [1], and I've had a couple of people find the \"Buy me a coffee\" button and GitHub sponsors page. While it is not a sustainable amount of sponsorship, the joy of seeing people support with a few bucks feels incredible. It's a passion project after all. I used to maintain a private fork of an OSS project as I assumed my company wouldn't want specific features out there (especially since they gave a competitive advantage). I eventually met up with the maintainers of that project with a situation I couldn't figure out and they were so eager to help. After, I went to legal and told them it didn't feel fair to have OSS maintainers help out but keep it private, and to my surprise, they agreed. All I had to do was ask, and not assume.

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

Are these projects the kind of thing anyone else will ever use? Probably not, so long as the company stays in business. The business case my team made was focused on transparency and long-term viability: our customers can see exactly what we're doing with their data and how our systems work, and if we go under, they have a realistic way to continue using our software. This hasn't ended up being a huge selling point, but customers have definitely mentioned it as one of the things they liked about us. reply",

I continued to contribute to OSS by day tho as I would try upstreaming changes / fixes At PeerDB (now ClickHouse) I'm again in OSS, & continue to contribute to other OSS projects as part of my day job. I'm fortunate to be working in a culture that respects devoting working hours to OSS.

          "text": "OSS is a side hustle for most people that work it. It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

          "text": "Hi teleforce, thanks! Your project sounds very interesting as well. That actually reminds me, at one point, a researcher suggested looking into geophone or fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data that oil companies sometimes collect in Alaska, potentially for tracking animal movements or impacts, but I never got the chance to follow up. Connecting seismic activity data (like yours) with potential effects on animal vocalizations or behaviour observed in acoustic recordings would be an interesting research direction! Regarding data access: Our labeled dataset (EDANSA, focused on specific sound events) is public here: https://zenodo.org/records/6824272 . We will be releasing an updated version with more samples soon. We are also actively working on releasing the raw, continuous audio recordings. These will eventually be published via the Arctic Data Center (arcticdata.io). If you'd like, feel free to send me an email (address should be in my profile), and I can ping you when that happens. Separately, we have an open-source model (with updates coming) trained on EDANSA for predicting various animal sounds and human-generated noise. Let me know if you'd ever be interested in discussing whether running that model on other types of non-stationary sound data you might have access to could be useful or yield interesting comparisons. reply",

          "text": "Hi d_burfoot, really appreciate you bringing that up! The idea of pre-training a big foundation model on our raw data using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (kind of like how GPT emerged in NLP) is definitely something we've considered and experimented with using transformer architectures. The main hurdle we've hit is honestly the scale of relevant data needed to train such large models from scratch effectively. While our ~19.5 years dataset duration is massive for ecoacoustics, a significant portion of it is silence or ambient noise. This means the actual volume of distinct events or complex acoustic scenes is much lower compared to the densely packed information in the corpora typically used to train foundational speech or general audio models, making our effective dataset size smaller in that context. We also tried leveraging existing pre-trained SSL models (like Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT for speech), but the domain gap is substantial. As you can imagine, raw ecoacoustic field recordings are characterized by significant non-stationary noise, overlapping sounds, sparse events we care about mixed with lots of quiet/noise, huge diversity, and variations from mics/weather. This messes with the SSL pre-training tasks themselves. Predicting masked audio doesn't work as well when the surrounding context is just noise, and the data augmentations used in contrastive learning can sometimes accidentally remove the unique signatures of the animal calls we're trying to learn. It's definitely an ongoing challenge in the field! People are trying different things, like initializing audio transformers with weights pre-trained on image models (ViT adapted for spectrograms) to give them a head start. Finding the best way forward for large models in these specialized, data-constrained domains is still key. Thanks again for the suggestion, it really hits on a core challenge! reply",

You're absolutely right, audio provides that crucial omnidirectional coverage that can supplement fixed field-of-view sensors like cameras. We actually collect images too and have explored fusion approaches, though they definitely come with their own set of challenges, as you can imagine. On the labeled audio data front: our Arctic dataset (EDANSA, linked in my original post) is open source. We've actually updated it with more samples since the initial release, and getting the new version out is on my to-do list. Polli.ai looks fantastic! It's genuinely exciting to see more people tackling the ecological monitoring challenge with hardware/software solutions.

This project was born out of the frustration of trying to generate an invoice on my phone on the go, I found all the existing solutions to be quite awful (forced signups to paid subscriptions, clunky interface etc). Would love to hear any feedback the HN crowd has. I'm aware of a couple of alignment issues, will fix them up tonight. Also, yes, there will be a \"generate PDF\" button, for now if you want a pdf I'd suggest using the Print dialog to \"Save as PDF\". https://bestfreeinvoice.com reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

          "text": "While all well and true. Some scale is assumed. There’s plenty of need for basic use invoicing like this. Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else.

There are plenty countries where the vendor will charge the account of the customer, like a 'pull' mechanism. In many countries they'll use (or used) checks/cheques for that, or a different payment account like a credit card. The agreement for this would have been a contract. They may still use invoices for larger transactions, but they aren't always required by law. I remember that in the old days, Google, Stripe, etc wouldn't send invoices, sometimes you'd get a minimal receipt message by email, but that was about it. This was particularly annoying for EU-based companies where there are minimal requirements for invoices and/or receipts. Times have changed though. Most companies, including US-based, will now offer invoices that comply with most international regulations. Except PayPal of course, for some reason they still seem to get away with not offering invoices.

I don’t believe either offer invoicing but you could integrate it yourself or just manually record. IMO, the hardest part of keeping your own books is learning double entry accounting. reply",

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system. [1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me [2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree. So no VR, no video-tracked physical miniatures, no custom-designed tabletop, no Microsoft Surface... Again, just my opinion. reply",

They might do okay, even pretty well, at combat maps and/or character sheets, but I want is the whole game world in the computer. Maps are just a fraction of what I need as a GM. I need data on economics and population numbers and power structures. And I need computation over all those things. For instance, my game rules include an economic subsystem, which takes in the production of goods and services at hundreds of in-game cities, and computes prices for over a thousand player-purchaseable goods. The \"second app\" that I referred to above allows players to (among many other things) purchase stuff at the market nearest their current location and have those items go straight into their character sheet. If the \"item\" is actually an animal, a hired mercenary, etc. then a different subsystem generates a new NPC with the right statistics and attaches the player to it as owner/liege. I could write an extension for a VTT that talks to my economic system over an API, and throws items up on screen, lets players purchase them, moves them into their character sheet using the right function calls in the VTT's extension library, etc. But every step of the way, I would be fighting to cram this subsystem into the VTT's conception that gameplay begins and ends with maps and char sheets. reply",

I don't think it will ever be a money spinner - it has ~70 folks using it buy they're all on the free tier. It's felt really good to build something useful, though. [1]: https://mentions.us reply",

Adding context on the image thing- I have old 32 bit apps for some of my hardware cameras / other devices that attach to Android Phones, that will not be backed up with all their settings, and that worries me as even though I've extracted their APKs for preserve, each install requires reaching out to a server for first activation and one day there won't be a response when the companies that made those hardware cameras end support - and I won't be able to do that first activation which is all they need. A Full image theoretically would make this a non-factor- but the built in Backup method for Android doesn't do this. This would be the same if had the Apple variant of these cameras. \nAnd while things like TWRP exist which could attempt it fully- that involves unlocking the bootloader which is what one does not want when there is a chance of a casual forensic search. reply",

          "text": "I frequently recommend Wix to freelance clients who just need a basic site. Once they set it up, it basically keeps going for years and years, which is not true of most other stacks, including Wordpress. It's an easy service from a single vendor, so no need to deal with different hosting/CDN/SSL/etc providers. I think it's a wonderful thing for clients with simpler needs. The benefit for clients is that they can pay you once, for a few hours, to help them set it up (if they even need that)... and then they basically don't need you anymore. I've \"lost\" several happy clients this way, but I'd rather they just use that service than waste their money on a developer they don't really need. It's very easy to use, reliable, and cheap. And they have a single vendor to go for any sort of support they might need for their website. In contrast to many of the over-engineered Next.js or Gatsby sites I've seen, Wix is far, FAR easier to maintain and I get pretty much zero complaints about it after initial setup. All the other stacks I've ever made for clients, whether they were in Next, React, Angular, vanilla HTML, Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, other CMSes... all became a maintenance headache after 2-3 years, and usually obsolete, unusable, and completely rewritten within 4-5. Not so with the Wix sites; they just keep going year after year and the client never worries about it again, logging in to post an occasional update every week or so but otherwise letting it do its thing. I wouldn't choose to use it for a personal project anything more advanced than a personal blog or a very simple marketing site. But it's fine for what it is, and the web is better off for having services like this for regular people to choose from. Not everything needs a super-heavy JS frontend. reply",

You can transfer the domains away or to them like any other registrar. This means that the customer \"owns\" it for the period of time it is registered for with an accredited registrar. The web builder companies do not own it on your behalf. There are no real SEO penalties, but as with any web property, you have to do the work to get all the SEO working as you want. As far as benefits for developers, give me an open source tool any day that I can improve on, extend, or mess up with sketchy coding. These tools are meant for consumers to build their own sites for the most part. They represent the initial commodification of \"get a website\". They are more difficult and/or expensive to extend than a tool like WordPress, Laravel, Hugo, etc. And they are walled gardens, which means they are difficult to migrate away from. reply",

          "text": "There’s this popular pastime lately where people pretend to be the last rational mind on Earth while making blanket pronouncements about tech they don’t understand. >“Avoid it! Perplexity rules prohibit commercial use…” Cool story, but also: irrelevant. Nobody serious is shipping products on Perplexity as a backend. It’s a research tool with a nice wrapper. The people building with LLMs are using OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Groq, and Ollama, depending on the constraints and goals. Acting like the existence of one walled garden invalidates an entire paradigm is like saying cars are bad because golf carts can’t go on highways. > “ChatGPT rules prohibit sharing the output with other AI…” There are some restrictions, yes. And that matters… if your use case is literally just shuttling model output between APIs like a glorified message broker. Most developers are fine with this because they’re building systems, not playing telephone. > “They’re training on everything you pass in…” This is just flat wrong. OpenAI doesn’t train on API input/output unless you explicitly opt in. The fact that this myth is still circulating tells me people are repeating each other instead of reading the docs. > “You’re paying to get brain raped…” If your argument requires dehumanizing metaphors to land, you don’t have an argument. You have trauma cosplay. > “Coding with OpenAI = being a sheep…” This is the kind of thing people say when they’ve never delivered software in production. The tools either help or they don’t. Calling people sheep for using powerful tools is anti-intellectualism dressed up as cynicism. Nobody’s building a search engine from scratch to prove they’re not a sheep either. We use leverage. That’s the whole game. > “You’re paying them to train their model to imitate you…” Actually, no — again, unless you opt in. But even if that were true, you’re also trading that data for time saved, features shipped, and workflows unlocked. You know, ROI. > “Better off learning a better (compiled) programming language…” I have nothing against compiled languages, but this is like telling someone struggling with Figma that they should learn Blender. It might be good advice in a vacuum, but it doesn’t help you win the game that’s actually being played. > “Why pay OpenAI for the privilege to help them take your job?” You could’ve said the same thing about AWS. Or GitHub. Or Stack Overflow. Or even programming itself, in the mainframe era. Gatekeeping based on purity is a waste of time. The actual work is understanding what AI can do, what it shouldn’t do, and when to lean in. > “Why outsource mental activity to a service with a customer noncompete?” You’re not outsourcing thinking. You’re compressing cognitive overhead. There’s a difference. If you think using AI is “outsourcing thinking,” you were probably outsourcing thinking to Stack Overflow and Copilot already. ⸻ Look, are there risks? Costs? Vendor lock-in traps? Of course. Anyone seriously building with AI right now is absorbing all that volatility and pushing forward anyway, because the upside is that massive. Dismissing the entire space as a scam or a trap is either willful ignorance or fear masquerading as intellectual superiority. If you don’t want to use AI tools, don’t. But don’t throw rocks from the sidelines at the people out there testing edge cases, logging failures, bleeding tokens, and figuring out what’s possible. reply",

          "text": "Personally, I would get started using Aider.chat.  It's pretty intuitive if you're comfortable in a terminal. No matter what, the current paradigm is the \"mixture of experts\", aka defining roles and then switching between the roles.  In the case of Aider, you're mainly looking at \"architect\" and \"code\".  Others like Cline/Roo provide also this, but more limitations and access to MCP.  Honestly, I would avoid these more advanced tools until you get an understanding for how everything works. Begin with your \"architect\" and agree on a design, then act as an engineering manager to guide your \"code\" model to implement the tests.  Once you have a full test suite, make sure that you can use commands like `/lint` and `/test` to call  your toolchain as needed. I personally prefer this method (again, when you're getting started) because it's independent of every IDE and will work anywhere you have a terminal.  After you get comfortable, you'll quickly want to use a more advanced tool to trade your money for the time of the machine(s).  When you get to that point you'll understand what the fuss is about. reply",

The key is treating documentation as a \"context API\" for the AI rather than just human-readable text.

It seems like it's just overloading the standard vscode UI, with no regard for what you're used to. Trying to press tab for what looks like a \"normal\" autocomplete will invoke the LLM autocomplete that will replace a bunch of lines somewhere else without you noticing. Terrible UX! Modifications made by the chat interface are also hard to restrict to a specific part. Sure, you can give it context, but asking it to modify one thing (by highlighting a bunch of rows in a specific file and giving them as context) is likely to end up modifying a similar-looking thing somewhere else. The potential is there with Cursor, but right now it's a mess for serious use. Waiting for editors that incorporate LLM-based autocomplete in a disciplined way where I'll actually feel like I'm the one in control. Maybe once the dumb hype around vibe coding dies down. reply",

This way, you can review each suggested change, click apply if you like it, review that specific change and make any edits, then proceed to the next suggestion block. This is the best way to avoid chaotic changes that become difficult to review thoroughly, and while it takes longer, is a much less risky approach using focused, granular edits. It’s a much more efficient workflow than alt-tabbing and copy pairing to and from a website, and much more powerful with how easily you can add context, swap out the LLM model being called, and apply suggestions that you deem acceptable with granular oversight. reply",

You should keep the nature of the tool exposed to you at all times. I say you should: - identify the things about your personal development process that you'd like to streamline (up to and including not having to code everything by hand) - write Python scripts that call LLMs (or don't!) to achieve the thing you want. - heck, write library functions and establish some neat patterns - a random prompt picker using a folder of txt files, why not? Not only can you create a development experience that approximates much of what Cursor does, you can make one that is twice as good for you because it is aligned with how you work, and how you think. And at that point, with your fluent new workflow, making a simple VSCode extension to hook into your scripts can't be all that hard. At that point, how can Cursor compete? reply",

          "text": "Admittedly, I’ve achieved so much with the assistance of extensions like Cline/Roo that I have a sort of youthful exuberance that wants to proclaim that the barrier to entry to building applications with AI is falling. It’s not. These tools will literally waste your time and empty your wallet if you don’t have a solid approach — and that starts with knowing how to detect code and architecture smells at light speed. These tools are writing code faster than you can read it so you better know what you’ve (actually) instructed it to do, and be able to monitor the quality in a 300ms glance or you’re hosed. Having said that, there are antidotes: 1. Use a memory-bank. A memory bank is a little folder where you instruct the agent to research upcoming tasks, store progress info, post gotchas, generate retrospectives and more. It’s super helpful if the thing you’re building is large and complex. 2. Instruct the agent to implement strict TDD/BDD principles and force it to follow a red-green-refactor workflow at a granular level. The downside to this is twice the code (read $tokens) per feature but you’ll spend it anyway when your agent has 600 lines of untested code written while you grabbed coffee and you come back to the agent stuck in a loop, spending $0.20 per request sending the same large files trying to figure out some syntax error between test and code files. 3. You need to know what you’re doing. The model/agent is not going to automatically apply second and third order thinking to look around systems design corners. It does exactly what you tell it to do (sometimes well) but you also have to always be considering what you forgot to tell it to do (or not to do). Prompt engineering is not natural language. It’s a form of spellweaving where you have to find the edges of all relevant forms of existence and non-existence, codify them into imperative language, add the right nuance to finesse the style and have the confidence to cast the spell — over and over and over again. 4. You need money. Building a serious endeavor with an AI agent will cost you around $400-600 a month. Leave room for lots of mistakes. Prepare for weeping and gnashing of teeth when the task counter hits $10.00, you’re like 20% done with the feature, the model has lost context about what it was doing and you have to choose between making a broken commit and hoping the agent can sort it out in a clean task, or eating the cost and starting over. I spent $50 on starting over just this past weekend. This is why I wrote numbers 1-3 above. I’m committed to figuring out where all the pitfalls are so others might not have to. I personally feel like anyone who’s doing this right now is really just burning some cash to see what’s possible. reply",

          "text": "There is more than one way to answer this. They have made an alternative to the CUDA language with HIP, which can do most of the things the CUDA language can. You could say that they haven't released supporting libraries like cuDNN, but they are making progress on this with AiTer for example. You could say that they have fragmented their efforts across too many different paradigms but I don't think this is it because Nvidia also support a lot of different programming models. I think the reason is that they have not prioritised support for ROCm across all of their products. There are too many different architectures with varying levels of support. This isn't just historical. There is no ROCm support for their latest AI Max 395 APU. There is no nice cross architecture ISA like PTX. The drivers are buggy. It's just all a pain to use. And for that reason \"the community\" doesn't really want to use it, and so it's a second class citizen. This is a management and leadership problem. They need to make using their hardware easy. They need to support all of their hardware. They need to fix their driver bugs. reply",

I'm asking because I think a firmware has to directly talk to hardware through lower HAL (hardware abstraction layer), while customer facing parts should be fairly isolated in the upper HAL. Some companies like to add direct HW acces to customer interface via more complex functions (often a recipe made out of lower HAL functions), which I always disliked. I prefer to isolate lower level functions and memory space from the user. In any case, both Nvidia and AMD should have very similar FW capabilities. I don't know what I'm missing here. reply",

NVIDIA while far from perfect has always easily kept stride in software quality ahead of AMD for over 20 years.  While AMD repeatedly keeps falling on their face and getting egg all over themselves again and again and again as far as software goes.

          "text": "It is a little bit more complicated than ROCm simply not having support because ROCm has at a point claimed support, and they've had to walk it back painfully (multiple times). Its not a driver issue, nor a hardware issue on their side. There has been a long-standing issue between AMD and its mainboard manufacturers. The issue has to do with features required for ROCm, namely PCIe Atomics. AMD has been unable or unwilling to hold the mainboard manufacturers to account for advertising features the mainboard does not support. The CPU itself must support this feature, but the mainboard must as well (in firmware). One of the reasons why ROCm hasn't worked in the past is because the mainboard manufacturers have claimed and advertised support for PCIe Atomics, and the support they've claimed has been shown to be false, and the software fails in non-deterministic ways when tested. This is nightmare fuel for the few AMD engineers tasked with ROCm. PCIe Atomics requires non-translated direct IO to operate correctly, and in order to support the same CPU models from multiple generations they've translated these IO lines in firmware. This has left most people that query their system to check this showing PCIAtomics is supported, while when actual tests that rely on that support are done they fail, in chaotic ways. There is no technical specification or advertising that the mainboard manufacturers provide showing whether this is supported. Even the boards with multiple x16 slots and the many technologies related to it such as Crossfire/SLI/mGPU brandings these don't necessarily show whether PCIAtomics is properly supported. In other words, the CPU is supported, the firmware/mainboard fail with no way to differentiate between the two at the upper layers of abstraction. All in all. You shouldn't be blaming AMD for this. You should be blaming the three mainboard manufacturers who chose to do this. Some of these manufacturers have upper end boards where they actually did do this right they just chose to not do this for any current gen mainboard costing less than ~$300-500. reply",

Not sure what happened there but this seems to suggest AMD might have had a workaround at some point (though possibly it didn't work). If this really is due to patent issues AMD can likely afford to licence or cross-license the patent given potential upside.

The \"standard\" is to ship a PCIe card with display handling drivers and some streaming multiprocessor hardware to process your framebuffers. Nvidia goes even further by adding additional accelerators (ALUs by way of CUDA core and tensor cores), onboard RTOS management hardware (what Nvidia calls GPU System Processor), and more complex userland drivers that very well might be able to manage atomics without any PCIe standards. This is also one of the reasons AMD and Apple can't simply turn their ship around right now. They've both invested heavily in simplifying their GPU and removing a lot of the creature-comforts people pay Nvidia for. 10 years ago we could at least all standardize on OpenCL, but these days it's all about proprietary frameworks and throwing competitors under the bus. reply",

          "text": "FYI AMD also has similar \"accelerators\", with the 9070 having separate ALU paths for wmma (\"tensor\") operations much like Nvidia's model - older RDNA2/3 architectures had accelerated instructions but used the \"normal\" shader ALUs, if a bit beefed up and tweaked to support multiple smaller data types. And CUDA cores are just what Nvidia call their normal shader cores. Pretty much every subunit on a geforce has a direct equivalent on a radeon - they might be faster/slower or more/less capable, but they're there and often at an extremely similar level of the design. AMD also have on-die microcontrollers (multiple, actually) that do things like scheduling or pipeline management, again just like Nvidia's GSP. It's been able to schedule new work on-GPU with zero host system involvement since the original GCN, something that Nvidia advertise as \"new\" with them introducing their GSP (which just replaced a slightly older, slightly less capable controller rather than being /completely/ new too) The problem is that AMD are a software follower right now - after decades of under-investment they're behind on the treadmill just trying to keep up, so when the Next Big Thing inevitably pops up they're still busy polishing off the Last Big Thing. I've always seen AMD as a hardware company, with the \"build it and they will come\" approach - which seems to have worked for the big supercomputers who likely find it worth investing in their own modified stack to get that last few %, but clearly falls down selling to \"mere\" professionals. Nvidia, however, support the same software APIs on even the lowest end hardware, while nobody is likely running much on their laptop's 3050m in anger, it offers a super easy on-ramp for developers - and it's easy to mistake familiarity with superiority - you already know to avoid the warts so you don't get burned by them. And believe me, CUDA has plenty of warts. And marketing - remember \"Technical Marketing\" is still marketing - and to this day lots of people believe that the marketing name for something, or branding a feature, implies anything about the underlying architecture design - go to an \"enthusiast\" forum and you'll easily find people claiming that because Nvidia call their accelerator a \"core\" means it's somehow superior/better/\"more accelerated\" than the direct equivalent on a competitor, or actually believe that it just doesn't support hardware video encoding as it \"Doesn't Have NVENC\" (again, GCN with video encoding was released before a Geforce with NVENC). Same with branding - AMD hardware can already read the display block's state and timestamp in-shader, but Everyone Knows Nvidia Introduced \"Flip Metering\" With Blackwell! reply",

          "text": "I want to argue that graphics cards are really 3 markets: integrated, gaming (dedicated), and compute. Not only do these have different hardware (fixed function, ray tracing cores, etc.) but also different programming and (importantly) distribution models. NVIDIA went from 2 to 3. Intel went from 1 to 2, and bought 3 (trying to merge). AMD started with 2 and went to 1 (around Llano) and attempted the same thing as NVIDIA via GCN (please correct me if I'm wrong). My understanding is that the reason is that the real market for 3 (GPUs for compute) didn't show up until very late, so AMD's GCN bet didn't pay off. Even in 2021, NVIDIA's revenue from gaming was above data center revenue (a segment they basically had no competition in, and 100% of their revenue was from CUDA). AMD meanwhile won the battle for Playstation and Xbox consoles, and was executing a turnaround in data centers with EPYC and CPUs (with Zen). So my guess as to why they might have underinvested is basically: for much of the 2010s they were just trying to survive, so they focused on battles they could win that would bring them revenue. This high level prioritization would explain a lot of \"misexecution\", e.g. if they underhired for ROCm, or prioritized APU SDK experience over data center, their testing philosophy (\"does this game work ok? great\"). reply",

Nvidia can afford to develop a comprehensive software platform for the compute market segment because it has a comprehensive share of that segment. AMD cannot afford it because it does not have the market share. Or to put it another way, I assume that AMD's efforts are motivated rational economic behavior and it has not been economically rational to compete heavily with Nvidia  in the compute segment. AMD was able to buy ATI because ATI could not compete with Nvidia. So AMD's graphics business started out trailing Nvidia. AMD has had a viable graphics strategy without trying to beat Nvidia...which makes sense since the traditional opponent is Intel and the ATI purchase has allowed AMD to compete with them pretty well. Finally, most of the call for AMD to develop a CUDA alternative is based on a desire for cheaper compute. That's not a good business venture to invest in against a dominate player because price sensitive customers are poor customers. reply",

I agree with both your comment and the parent comment - serious competition could spell the end for CUDA's dominance. But there will never be serious competition, CUDA has the head-start and their competitors threw in the towel with OpenCL. Khronos can't get Apple to sign onto a spec and they can't get AMD to change their architecture - open GPGPU compute is stuck in neutral while Nvidia is shifting into 6th gear. Reality is that Nvidia could charge cloud-level margins and get away with it, because Apple is the only other TSMC customer with equivalent leverage and they pretend the server market doesn't exist. reply",

Their driver is also far more stable than AMD's. But AMD is also improving, they've made some significant strides over the last 12-18 months. But I think more importantly, what is often missed in this analysis is that most programmers doing ML work aren't writing their own custom kernels. They're just using pytorch (or maybe something even more abstracted/multi-backend like keras 3.x) and let the library deal with implementation details related to their GPU. That doesn't mean there aren't footguns in that particular land of abstraction, but the delta between the two providers is not nearly as stark as its often portrayed. At least not for the average programmer working with ML tooling.

That would imply that AMD could just focus on implementing good PyTorch support on their hardware and they would be able to start taking market share. Which doesn't sound like much work compared with writing a full CUDA competitor. But that does not seem to be the strategy, which implies it is not so simple?

Geohot has been very dedicated in working with AMD to upgrade their station in this space [2]. If you hang out in the tinygrad discord, you can see this happening in real time. > those I have talked to say they depend on a lot more than just one or two key libraries. Theres a ton of libraries out there yes, but if we're talking about python and the libraries in question are talking to GPUs its going to be exceedingly rare that theyre not using one of these under the hood: pytorch, tensorflow, jax, keras, et al. There are of course exceptions to this, particularly if you're not using python for your ML work (which is actually common for many companies running inference at scale and want better runtime performance, training is a different story). But ultimately the core ecosystem does work just fine with AMD GPUs, provided you're not doing any exotic custom kernel work. (EDIT: just realized my initial comment unintentionally borrowed the \"moat\" commentary from geohot's blog. A happy accident in this case, but still very much rings true for my day to day ML dev experience) [1] https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr...

This might seem small, but both projects have a larger people footprint than most tech companies' headcount that are operating at significant scale. On top of that, consider that pytorch is a project with its origins at Meta, and Meta has internal teams that spend 100% of their time supporting the project. Coupled with the fact that Meta just purchased nearly 200k units worth of AMD inference gear (MI300X), there is a massive groundswell of tech effort being pushed in AMD's direction. > wouldn't AMD just invest in doing this themselves, or at least provide much more support to these guys? That was actually the point of George Hotz's \"cultural test\" (as he put it). He wanted to see if they were willing to part with some expensive gear in the spirit of enabling him to help them with more velocity. And they came through, so I think that's a win no matter which lens you analyze this through. Since resources are finite, especially in terms of human capital, there's only so much to go around. AMD naturally can now focus more on the software closer to the metal as a result, namely the driver. They still have significant stability issues in that layer they need to overcome, so letting the greater ML community help them shore up the deltas in other areas is great. reply",

So they are winning a major battle (against Intel) even as they are losing a different one (against nVidia). I'm not sure there's a strategy they could have adopted to win both at the same time. However, the next big looming problem for them is likely to be the shrinking market for x86 vs. the growing market for Arm etc. So they might very well have demonstrated great core competence, that ends up being completely swept away by not just one but two major industry shifts. reply",

The two latter only work well when used in combination with manual methods though, as they won't pick up business logic, auth bypass, MFLAC/IDOR, etc. on their own. A lot of scanning templates / rulesets won't be 100% accurate or up-to-date, and will easily miss a lot of big things, so having it pentested by an actual person is always important. From the source code side of things, Semgrep / CodeQL, Veracode / Snyk, Burp Enterprise (CI/CD), etc. are good options. But again, most places shouldn't get just scans, there should be a manual component involving a security professional who knows what they're doing. XBOW is making some pretty cool strides in the meantime from a blackbox perspective though. reply",

          "text": "> Over the past few weeks, I’ve spoken with several VCs who confidently claim that companies won’t need to hire anyone in the next year or two because AI will handle everything. An important part of being a VC appears to be the ability to believe anything, no matter how stupid, as long as it is currently on-trend, then to abandon it as if it had never existed when fashions change (for instance, see the blockchain craze, which was shortly followed by a distinct NFT craze that was just the blockchain one resprayed). I would not take what _VCs_ say as any particular guide to reality. > Even Bill Gates recently said we might all be out of work soon and won’t need to do anything in an \"age of abundance.\" This would be the same Bill Gates who was claiming in the late 90s that by the early noughties our primary means of interfacing with our computers would be by talking to them, yes?

          "text": "My personal opinion: It will be similar to how computers affected jobs. No jobs are safe, but no skilled jobs are immediately on the chopping block either. AI will boost peoples' efficiency, such that it will take one skilled worker to do what it used to take five skilled workers to do. Law briefs, ad copy, scripting, code refactoring, engineering. Everything will use AI as a tool, but AI won't replace most people. People will instruct AIs to do sub-tasks and validate and integrate its responses. Similar to how people use computers today. Some peoples' specialized skills will be rendered obsolete, similar to what happened with secretaries, switchboard operators, elevator operators, proofreaders, etc. with computers. I think it will change what it means to do many jobs, just like working with computers changed, for instance, accounting, or visual design. Working with specialized AI tools will become an essential part of many jobs, just like working with specialized software tools is today. Long term, I think AI will eat further into current jobs, but I think they will be replaced with different human jobs. I think there will still be skilled careers and roles to be had, but I don't think any of us can predict what those jobs will look like. reply",

          "text": "As someone who believes AI will completely eliminate humans I wish I was could only be worried about job security. But to answer your question, AI will ultimately eliminate every job in the sense that if you believe AI will eventually be able do any task, and do it for cheaper than a human labourer, then there would be no reason for you to ever pay a human labourer. The best analogy here is probably how the industrial revolution made the horse redundant. It's not that horses can't be used for physically demanding work anymore, it's simply that it's cheaper in practically every imaginable case to use a machine so horses are no longer used. Of course, machines didn't replace the use of horses in all industries over night and we should expect the same will happen with AI. I'll assume this is what you're asking. It seems rather obviously to me that knowledge workers will be the easiest to replace with AI – especially knowledge workers who work purely digitally. The hardest work to replace will likely be physical labour since robotics is still very far from biological sophistication required to be competent at many physical jobs. And even when it starts to become competent it's going to take a while to build the robots to replace labourers and do so at a competitive cost. reply",

          "text": "> \"age of abundance\" No such thing will come to pass in the common way you think. This is classic doublespeak. Similar to \"You will own nothing and be happy\". If you think hard on it, the only way that can be true is by limiting the scope of the number of people involved, and the only way to do that is if a large number of people die, and that is what they mean and intend when they do not explicitly spell out how you get from statement to reality, addressing the complex hidden dependencies. It is unlikely that any blue-collar job will be impacted aside from the 2nd order effects that occur as displaced workers move to other areas as a necessity for survival. That won't last long though before the monetary and economic systems break down as they will have more chaotic whipsaws than the labor market. As for how safe are other jobs. You can expect all white collar low complexity work, normally found in entry level positions on career ladders, and related support staff, to be at extreme risk. The upper echelon of senior positions, and even mid-level positions are safe, due to the abstract nature of the tasks required, but are confounded by additional costs being imposed by third-parties (i.e. ghost jobs/postings). There's no good way to evaluate you have this degree of experience/knowledge, and worse you lose this type of knowledge if you don't use it regularly. The career pipeline however is a sequential pipeline. If there is no one going into the pipeline because AI has blocked and replaced the entry-level worker as a surrogate, and there is no one for the mid and senior level people to pass knowledge to because they've all been replaced by an AI it won't happen, and as those mid and senior level people age out you find yourself in a hysteresis problem that cannot be solved in the time period needed. The same as any ponzi scheme. Three stages. The funding mechanism for almost all companies today ensures this is always a problem for next quarter, creating a cascading failure, or slow motion trainwreck of costs where the employer will be unable to find any labor meeting that criteria for any price by stage 3. If this happens in critical national dependencies then you get a full blown socio-economic collapse in an environment of ecological overshoot (Malthus/Catton) that is global in nature (via reserve currency). Not pretty, 1/3 of 4bn people might survive such, maybe, and that's as a global population. We've known how to build resilient systems for quite some time, but resilient systems cost more and in furtherance of globalization optimization has coincided towards brittle single-point-of-failures broadly. It allows the most chaos, which speculators and companies alike use to reap gross profits at everyone elses expense through plausible narratives backed by price fixing. reply",
