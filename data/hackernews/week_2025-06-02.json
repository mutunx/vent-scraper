I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

I'm a customer-facing technical leader with 10+ years in tech and a track record of building customer experience functions from scratch. Most recently, I was the first customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24), a startup building an AI software engineer. I owned everything outside of engineering: support, developer relations / developer advocate, docs, YouTube demos, influencer outreach, blog posts, and building + open-sourcing demo apps. Before that, I was the first remote hire at Streak (YC S11) and spent several years owning customer onboarding, support, and automation. I also learned to code on the side, eventually completing the Capstone program at Launch School. I’m especially strong in early-stage chaos, where startups need someone who can do a bit of everything, talk to users, squash bugs, clean up docs, spin up demo apps, handle a support queue, write content, and generally make the founders’ lives easier. I’m looking for a startup where I can either be the first customer engineer or support leader, or join a small team as a DevRel/Community Engineer and help ship content + build trust with technical users. What I’m best at: * Translating user feedback into roadmap clarity * Turning vague “customer needs” into structured, scalable systems * Writing fast, clear docs + building content users actually read * Jumping into startup Discords and building real community * Owning support and success systems without needing hand-holding reply",

CV: Available on Request Email: ineedanengineer@outlook.com I bring your solutions to life. An Engineer of many hats, I solve your problems and bring them into the world. I’ve built entire systems from the ground up, delivered physical products in a matter of weeks, and kept Oil Rigs working offshore, built departments filled with the best people to produce top results and make the wonderful dreams reality. With a background in Electro Mechanical Engineering, I’ve designed products for the consumer, offshore, military markets, so I know what good hardware looks like. I’ve built prototypes for many markets, and architected complex systems from concept to retirement, in a complete cradle to grave manner. I’ve worked closely with software teams to guide development of new features to protect marine vessels from GPS jamming, developed APIs for integration and dug through code by hand to reverse engineer old products that haven’t been touched in decades to determine their operation and how they will be supported and upgraded to turn them into the feature they should be. As an Engineering Manager, I’ve been the driving force behind teams. I build teams based on two key ideas - is the team one full of individuals that are valued for their expertise, and is the culture one that I would like to be a part of? I make it a matter of pride that everyone should feel like an integral part of the team, and that mentality comes from the top down. I’ve worked with remotely distributed teams across many different disciplines, all working towards the end goal without ego getting in the way. My job has always been simple as the EM, give the team the tools and trust they need to do their absolute best. Your idea is your baby, it’s precious to you. I’ve worked at startups, small companies and mega corporations and I’ve always maintained a very simple philosophy when it comes to work - “are we doing what the customer needs with the best people we can get?” I’m your mechanical engineer, engineering manager, product manager, systems engineer, R&D specialist, market analyst and head of technology in one, and I’m ready to make your dream the product it needs to be, hardware or software. reply",

          "text": "I started as a dev shop and built 2 API products based on user demand. 1 is an OCR and document extraction service [0]. We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage.

I guess check your employment contracts and whatnot, but it's very common for people to leave a company and start consulting and/or freelancing in the expertise they gained at that company. And it's not too uncommon for former employers to be one of their first clients or get your first clients from relationships associated with your former employer. All of this assumes you don't burn bridges and have the interpersonal skills, in-demand expertise, luck, timing, and interest in building out a small service-based business. reply",

I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo. What I wish I knew: don't use RapidAPI. They charge 20%, they have a terrible interface, and they let customers run up huge charges and walk away without paying anything.

I don't fully understand this statement. the economic player with direct contact to the customer \"owns\" the customer and has a lot of power in negotiation with suppliers. the customer-facing players have the most information about their customers, and can offer adjacent products (want fries with that?) Uber and Lyft make big money, not their drivers. Amazon and Ebay make big money, not their sellers. McDonalds makes more money than their food suppliers, and franchisees. The exception is with something like intellectual property, let's use movies as an example. The owners of the content want to sell it widely and will do a variety of distribution deals for different distribution channels. However, if any distribution channel starts taking a big slice of the money pie, the terms of the contract renewal will be changed because without the content they are dead. reply",

ImageMagick is an open source tool for resizing images etc. But some people successfully build API services or SaaS-services on top of it. It works because people AND businesses pay for convenience. What space do you have knowledge of? What pains do people have in that domain that can be solved with tech? Always start with the problem.

When we launched 3 years ago our differentiator was that we could train both cheaper and faster by running on TPUs, these days GPUs have mostly caught up, and open source models are not as competitive as they once were. It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

          "text": "8 year old badly wants to be an engineer like his dad. :’) Public school got him into Scratch so he was animating things. The high school robotics team I mentor has Lego robotics kits for their community outreach program. Those kits use Scratch. So I got him a used kit and he spends an absolutely ridiculous amount of time making robots that do stuff. This started at a very young age: we gave him access to a windows PC, not a tablet. So by 3 he could log in and get to YouTube kids. This meant that keyboard and mouse and web browser were very comfortable concepts. We also gave him and his younger brother countless building toys. Meccano. Lego Technic. A few lessons I’d love to empart: - you can’t make your kid into this. His younger brother has no interest and is far more about sports. So we nurture that with him instead. - open ended learning. I’m not sitting down and teaching him.  All I do is make sure he has access to the tools, and I unstick him when he’s stuck. - I connect concepts when I see them. “That’s called a loop. It’s just like that thing you did in Minecraft to make your machine work over and over again.” - the learning must all be a side effect of having fun. Don’t try to teach programming. Do fun things and fill in the programming toolbox, tool by tool, as they’re needed. - connect programming to what your kid is passionate about. Programming is a means to an end, not the end itself.  My kid loves trains and has a Lego train set. I suggested he use his technic to automate the track switch. I then let him work at it for hours and hours over weeks, giving him breadcrumbs of what to consider next. reply",

Example: don’t tell them what a for loop is, make a project where they really need it, but let them first to write it very verbosely without loops, then they will almost invent it themselves and be relived when you teach them (same style can be applied to most things) - make projects that have low entry level, but where they can improve it infinitely. E.g. build an aquarium simulator or a city simulator using p5.js - make them collaborate with other kids if possible, often they learn better from their peers than listening to their parents. Facilitate collaboration, and help them come up with more and more difficult projects, that require more and more of them, so they don’t stay on the same level too long reply",

          "text": "I taught kids how to code for several years, both in person and through a website that taught Python to ~500k kids. My eternal advice with teaching CS is to delay abstractions as long as possible . Teach them how to draw a circle on a canvas, then get them to move the circle to different parts of the canvas, then get them to draw multiple overlapping circles/rectangles/etc. Once you've got that down, make a bouncing ball animation, simple games, and so on. Most kids don't really care for leetcode problems these days, so it's best to stick to things that are visual, creative, and instant-feedback (i.e. games). This was a really useful realization when I was teaching kids to code in person for ~5 years. I started off teaching Java with an abstraction layer ( https://www.bluej.org/ ), but I found that many students would be intimidated by anything that ventured outside of the abstraction (e.g. just run `javac` on your computer with a `.java` file). My most successful students intuitively understood how to turn a text file on their computer into a useful piece of compiled code, or into a JAR bundle that they could share with others. They also used the various abstractions that were thoughtfully introduced over time - e.g. an IDE that gives you a run button, libraries like Firebase which enable some exciting multiplayer game options, and so on. reply",

Vibe coding helps developers achieve their vision with models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate code from natural language prompts. Instead of writing every line of code, developers can now describe the desired functionality in plain language. AI translates these \"vibes\" into your vision. That's not thinking. We've even appropriated \"vibe\" terminology, which means something like emotional gut feel, without having to think about it.  (Mostly associated with wake-and-bake stoners, who've self-imposed two-digit IQs and munchies, and who will sometimes speak in terms of \"vibes\", for lack of further analytic capacity.) Recognizing that the top killer app for \"AI\" right now is cheating on homework, the collaborate-with-AI 'skill' is like the well-known collaborate-with-lab-partner.  The lab partner who does all the work, while the slacking student learns nothing, and therefore the slacker fails the exam.  (But, near-term, the slacker might scrape by with a C- for the class, due to copying the lab portion, and due to an instructor who now just wants to be rid of the hopeless student.)

I want kids to learn by figuring out things as they're building something that they want to build. And when they can't independently invent a concept or technique that they need for something they're building, you can nudge them.  (Example: Their 2D video game screen refreshes are too slow, and now they would be excited to be introduced to double-buffering.  And now they'll know exactly why they need it and how it works.  So, the next time they need a related graphics improvement, they've had that prior learning experience, and might be able to figure it out on their own.) Imagine if young Carmack had been plopped down in front of a vibe coding session for Unity or Unreal, stated what he wanted, and it emitted yet another generic 3D first-person shooter.  Would he have ever been motivated to innovate anything, and if he was, would he have the cognitive strength and learning skill to do so? reply",

This creativity can be captured by coding, maybe, but maybe there are better outlets for the individual. The director of street fighter 5, for example, started as a music composer. I think it's important to really understand our kids. They may not have the experience or vocabulary to have this discussion. Wanting to make a game and coding are different things. You're on the right path in terms of breaking things down into smaller, solvable problems.

Problem decomposition - Given The previous how can I chunk the overall space of action into measurable and manageable parts to solve 4. Tool selection - what effector systems can I access and can they solve the subproblems? 5. Structured solution exploration - Now that I know my goal, context, problem heirarchy and tools, how do I create experimental system to progressively solve each subproblem and the intersection between them Then it’s just running that until you have a solution This transcends “coding” to more important thing which is holistic alignment of goal (direction) and action capabilities (magnitude) that results in a measured action vector which is discrete and bounded. reply",

Mostly my goal was to make him motivated to learn (showing him interesting projects I had been working on, etc.). From my experience with motivation and time the skills will come themselves, without motivation, every attempt is pointless.

Focusing on CS fundamentals isn't always worthwhile, unless there's a genuine interest in computer science or math olympiad style problems.

Just my two cents: if your kids aren't very interested or ready for that kind of knowledge now, you might find that in a few years they can learn it surprisingly quickly if they're interested then.

          "text": "I have 3 kids, all around the same age (K/1). They all got laptops about 18 months ago for christmas. I installed mint linux on all of them, and installed a few free/libre games for them to play, and I self-host the game server at home. One game they play is luanti (formerly minetest). I gave them instructions on how to clone the git repository for the game, run the build script, and then start the game. They've probably forgotten the build instructions, but they know to play, they have to type `cd code/minetest` and then `bin/luanti`. Occasionally they have to run `git pull` to update the code on their computers. I handle all the game server administration. I initially blocked all internet access with a kill switch, but this quickly became an issue because you need to be able to run `apt update` and a few other commands to keep the system up to date. So now I run a proxy server called e2guardian that lets them access sites that I choose. Later, I introduced them to scratch, and I downloaded the entirely of griffpatch's youtube library with yt-dlp and organized it into folders on each of  their computers. I've done the same thing with other tutorial style videos. They don't have access to youtube, and I don't really think it makes sense to give them access at this age. They run scratch locally, as opposed to using scratch.mit.edu. I enabled the scratch website for a couple of days as a treat for them, and as expected, they spent most of the time exploring and playing others' games, but very little time building their own. I sort of expected this to happen, so we closed off access a few days later, and they took some of the ideas they saw online and started playing with them locally. So my experience is: a) linux makes a great platform for kids, since it's very easy to tweak things to stop behaviors that you don't want to reinforce. e.g. `sudo chmod 400 /usr/local/games` turns off all the games, `sudo killall kidname` will close the desktop session if your kid isn't listening when it's time for bed, you can set up time-based login policies with pam_time, you can install your own root certificates for SSL MITM, etc. b) games reinforce that \"computers are fun\", and games like luanti are free, open-source, and hackable. c) interest in games naturally spills over into interest in making your own games. If you want to try luanti/minetest, I recently cleaned up/released a mod that I built for the kids last year called turtlebots. It's a visual programming tool that lets you program little turtle-shaped robots that can navigate in a minecraft-style world and build things as they move around.

          "text": "It's important to remember that the exercise of teaching children coding isn't so much about teaching them how to code, but how to think, how to plan, predict, conjecture, reason and so forth. It's just a convenient and quicker way of teaching these things than the alternatives. If they have a good foundation in these things, then if they choose to go on to coding later they can learn all of the minutiae. But I've found in teaching it is important to stress that learning basic coding is _not_ about steering them towards coding as a career, or even a pursuit. It _is_ important to stress that learning basic coding will help them become better problem solvers, better able to anticipate issues and mitigate them. And that this is useful to them in a wide variety of areas in which they may have interest, such as sports, engineering, adventuring etc. And yes, also learning how to guide an LLM. So once you get those fundamentals down in the context of coding (Scratch, GameMaker, Logo, BASIC are all fine here), go practice them in more real-world applications. Those are the skills you need to foster, not object-oriented programming. And if they take an interest in going further with coding, then that's fine. They will have the tools they need to do that. reply",

The delta-epsilon definition of a limit was what really kick-started my interest in mathematics, but it was also so brutal to wrap my head around. I would say the concept of a group is another one for a lot of people. Abstract algebra is sometimes the first time you take a math class in undergrad where all references to numbers are very far away, and you have to accept that the definition of a group contains vast and untold multitudes beyond its straightforward definition. When it \"clicked\" for me, however, everything else in that class started flowing much better. Gauge invariance in mathematical physics might be another good one, but that's a lot more niche in who actually learns it. Lyapunov stability from dynamical systems is something I'd point out as actually the opposite of this - it makes a lot of sense very quickly and helps make light of quite a few things you see in the dynamical systems course material leading up to it. reply",

The Gemini protocol doesn't really offer what the old web was all about because it doesn't allow the author the degree of freedom and creativity that the old web did. It was designed under the premise that the \"web\" should only be a strictly textual data format with only links to other documents and that styling and layout should be extremely minimal and entirely controlled by the client. Which is not what the old web was, either technically or in spirit. It's what some people believe the old web should have been. As such it can only appeal to a subset of even technical people, and it's probably reached its saturation point by now. reply",

I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards.

Something that is more accurate but put in a boring way will often be downvoted, while straight up incorrect but funny/emotional/\"fitting the group think\" comments usually get upvoted. For us who've spent a lot of time on the web, this sort of bullshit detector is basically built-in at this point, but if you're new to places where the group think is so heavy as on reddit, it's worth being careful taking anything at face value. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

          "text": "This is of course true is some cases and less true in others. I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you.

I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive.

The problem is that most of the public space has been poisoned with AI hype, and it's nearly impossible to find more than surface-level introductions for a lot of topics because the substandard Medium posts and YouTube hypemongers drowns them out. Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful. But for the wider internet, the hype train has forced most of the informed discourse off the road. reply",

I think LLMs will find their uses, it just takes time to distil what they are really useful for vs what the AI companies are generating hype for.

          "text": "> The number of quantized bits is a trade off between size and quality. Ideally you should be aiming for a 6-bit or 5-bit model. I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

          "text": "I completely disagree. I don't see the current status quo fundamentally changing. That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

At least that particular concern isn’t the ball mover people’s comments here would make you think it is.

Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results.

I upgraded the WiFi to an Intel AX210 6e for about another $10 off Amazon. It gets 6-8 hours of battery life doing browsing and texting editing kind of workloads. The only thing that is itching me to get a new machine is it needs a 19V power supply. Luckily it's a pretty common barrel size, I already had several power cables laying around that work just fine.

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

Unless you have already spent big $$ on a GPU for gaming, I really don't think buying GPUs for home makes sense, considering the hardware and running costs, when you can go to a site like vast.ai and borrow one for an insanely cheap amount to try it out.

          "text": "I can think of a few reasons. 1. What you said about matching the way you think and your personal style. 2. Longevity. If you use someone else’s peoject, it’s dependent on them maintaining it. Assuming you don’t want to take it over at some point, making your own thing means you know how it all works so you can fix/maintain it if needed, and build it in a way that requires as little or as much maintenance as you want. 3. Building the tools is more fun than what you will ultimately do with it. I find the idea of writing my own site building compelling. Based on how many blogs I’ve started and never wrote in regularly, I don’t actually find the act of blogging compelling. People who have something to say and want an easy way to get the message out just pick a tool and stick with it. Others like myself, will build platforms to say things, then never actually say anything. I just build blogs from scratch over and over again, because it’s an easy, but semi interesting project that can be solved in countless ways. This could be called procrastination, but I think it’s something else, as I’m not actually trying that hard to have a blog or a site with traffic that people care about and visit. It’s just for me. reply",

There is a psychological measure for this called uncertainty avoidance . As for myself I have learned to avoid certain things that only induce complexity and as result feel confident I can build almost anything in JavaScript/TypeScript. Here are my zones of avoidance. * DOM abstraction. Working with the DOM is stupid simple, so don’t use unnecessary abstractions to make it something it isn’t. Sometimes I do find the DOM is missing important features so I will extend the DOMs API with original methods, such as getNodesByType. * No OOP. I avoid classes and inheritance as entirely unnecessary. Functions and objects are all I need for architecture. * Know your platform. In the browser it’s the DOM and Web APIs. In Node it’s their direct module APIs. Get comfortable working as close to the platform as possible. It’s less to troubleshoot later. * Avoid unnecessary string parsing. This includes things like querySelectors, innerHTML, and a lot of insanity from framework template systems. This is by far one of the two biggest performance boosts. * Preference WebSockets over HTTP. This also dramatically boosts performance and significantly reduces application complexity. reply",

          "text": "People love their craft and want to really understand how a tool works. They might start with taking a tool apart, looking at how it works, putting it back together and then using it for a bit.  Then they need a similar tool for a slightly different use case, so they start making one themselves. Maybe they have more specific, detailed needs than existing tools. Maybe there is something about the tool that annoys them or they think they could make it work better. This keeps going over time. > This was the craftsman’s ‘Golden Age’ and much time and trouble was taken over the design of tools. Craftsmen were being called upon to do more skilful and exacting work and the use of tools and the interest in development had become very widespread. Above pulled from A Brief History of the Woodworking Plane [0]. A woodworking tool that has evolved over 2,000 years. Now there are electric planers, handheld electric planers and lots of heavy machinery that do the same thing in a very automated way. If a company is mass producing kitchen cabinets, they aren't hand planing edges on boards, a machine is doing all that work. I feel like with AI we are on the cusp of moving beyond a \"Golden age\" and into an \"industrial age\" for coding, where it will become more important to have code that AI understands vs. something that is carefully crafted. Simple business pressure will demand it (whether we like it or not). The difference with hand planes (and other woodworking tools/concepts) is that a lot of people can appreciate a piece of furniture and the craft that went into it by opening a drawer and seeing hand cut dovetails for example.  When it comes to digital products, none of the consumers of the product will really care about the craftsman that created a JS library that they are indirectly using on a web site that has its \"view source\" hidden with minification/obfuscation.

He doesn't believe in slowly turning on things with old electrolytic capacitors, for example. I've learned quite a bit from him. I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts. (Only use 1 hand, keep the other behind you, always have a safety partner, etc) I've learned to hate Silver Mica capacitors. I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder. I'd suggest starting with something like an Arduino starter kit to get a sense of how components actually interact. But remember, if something is dead, you can't really make it worse.

If one just knows, for example, that very many faults are power supply related, and knows that problems with capacitors and transistors are responsible for a lot of power supply problems, you can accomplish quite a bit. But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult. But even then, if we watch some of what the different folks on Youtube accomplish repairing smartphones, laptops, etc., we'll see that some of these guys can achieve some pretty impressive results even without fancy labs and complete schematics, etc. Not everything is repairable of course, but I don't think pursuing this path is exactly \"tilting at windmills\" either. reply",

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

It gives me enough to know that I could be out of a job for a year without being homeless and hungry (not counting retirement assets) It means that even though we live in Florida, I can still say “let’s go to Costa Rica and Panama City for the entire winter”.  And even locally when I want to fly back to my former home for a weekend every quarter just to play cards with my friends and hang out I can or if we just want to rent an Airbnb back home for a couple of months during the summer to spend time with friends and our adult sons. When our friends suggest we get together and go on a cruise during Christmas we don’t think about it, we just say “yes”. When my younger adult son calls us and tells us he is going to be temporarily laid off during Christmas we just ask how much he needs and don’t think about it. Notice I didn’t say “buy things”.  We live in a 1200 square foot condo and everything we own besides our car can literally fit in four suitcases and we have actually traveled around the country with everything we owned in suitcases. Even the furniture in our condotel came with it and if we do sell it, it stays with it. We threw away or gave away everything but the clothes we actually wear and our electronic devices and we even downsized those.  If you can’t tell - we really hate “stuff”.  Our one car is the cheapest thing that we could buy that was the base level of comfort we could deal with. We use money for experiences, spend time with friends and family to allow my wife to pursue her passions and do her volunteer work.  Even before she retired she was able to get a lower paying job (with the benefits we needed then) working with special needs kids. reply",

We still enjoy spending on travel but we live in a high COL area, have a big mortgage, a couple of nice cars and buy too much non-essential stuff online. We do also try to give a good amount to causes we believe in and save well for retirement. I think saying \"money doesn't buy happiness\" is too reductive. The crap from Amazon certainly makes no meaningful difference and actually I feel slightly embarrassed when I see a new package arrive. But the relief from stress of having no debt, living in a good area for schools, having a large runway and not worrying about the cost of groceries is a real life improvement that I would be sad to give up. Having said that, none of the great memories from life so far involve spending huge amounts of money. reply",

But since I was old enough to actually look at paycheck (paycheque?) calculators online, I've found that the UK tax rate for livable wages is actually fairly low. To compare NYC to UK, £66k/yr = $90k/yr. In the UK, you would be taxed £17k ($23k), but that same salary living in NYC would be taxed $26k (£19k). So NYC + Fed + NYS taxed together at a higher rate than the UK government (INCLUDING NI). And $90k in NYC feels like WAY less than £66k somewhere Zone 4-6 in London with a similar commute. reply",

I offer as a counterweight to all the frugality that inevitably accrues in these sorts of threads. Sorry, Financial Independence, Retire Early folks. Read at your own risk. Judge if you will. Income is $450k / yr, engineer, 39 years old, no kids and no plans to have them. I have a chronic illness and retirement seems a distant and not very pleasant prospect. I like working and like to enjoy life. * $5k / month on rent. (Nice apartment in a high cost of living city). * At least $7k month goes into savings (I’m not totally financially irresponsible!) * One pretty ordinary car, expect to drive it for 10 yrs, usual costs. * $5k / month average on travel. My biggest luxury. I fly international business class sometimes but only when it’s “cheap”. * $2k / month on groceries, wine, dining out. I enjoy fine dining. * $3k / month on clothes and accessories. I’m a woman and I have a weakness for nice things, worst of all for designer bags. Yes I know it’s frivolous but the marginal utility is there for me. * $1k / month on a personal trainer. Could I have the same level of fitness without it? In theory yes, in practice no. The thing I wish I had more of is time, not in the sense of “retire and don’t work” but in the sense of “it would be nice to take a slight pay cut and work only 9 months of the year and travel more and spend the rest of the time reading, studying math again, and doing interesting projects.” Unfortunately that option isn’t really open to me, outside of consulting which I have no appetite for. I didn’t get into engineering for the money, but out of love. I’d have done it anyway. But the money is nice, for sure. I save some and don’t feel the need to be unnecessarily frugal with the rest. I know I’m incredibly fortunate. Your mileage may vary, and especially if you have kids. Make your own choices according to your values. reply",

Well, my hobbies could be expensive but I don't go down the road some people do. I have a wife and two kids. A decent portion of my money goes to the normal family expenses including retirement savings. Outside of that, my biggest expenses, in order-ish, are: - Concerts. My wife and I love going to see music so it's maybe $100 bucks for a concert or two per month. - Once or twice a year I'll buy myself a new guitar pedal. They tend to be higher quality ones so that will run you $300 - $400 easy. - Pokemon cards. My son got into and I got hooked. It's a deep strategy game and it's tons of fun. We probably spend ~$50 a month on this. We go to a game store to play on the weekends so we always buy a pack or two to help support the store. - The usual drugs. Alcohol. Weed. The less usual but still good drugs, mushrooms and molly (pure MDMA) a few times a year. If I had a billion dollars I would probably have things like a personal driver and chef, and maybe a few nicer guitars and some sweet-ass pokemon cards, but overall I want for nothing. As you can see, I tend to spend money on experiences instead of things. The physical things I do buy, pedals and cards, are for things I do with other people. My biggest restriction is having two kids, 4 and 7. I would love to travel more but it's not a money issue. reply",

This applies for small purchases like a tempting snack at the grocery store. Am I going to eat it? Will I really enjoy this? If so, ok. If it will sit in the cabinet and be passed over for other snacks, no. It applies to large purchases as well. Should I buy this very expensive bicycle? Yes, I will ride it. And as it turns out, I did. It’s almost 10 years old, and I still ride it a lot. I’m also regularly going through my belongings and donating, selling, and trashing things I don’t use. This helps me to learn over time and make better purchasing decisions. It also helps me reduce the amount of crap I have. Best of all it’s really nice when I can give something to someone who appreciates it much more and will make better use of it. The result is that other than the regular essential things to maintain life such as food, household goods, etc. I buy things extremely rarely. The thing I spend the most disposable income on is probably tickets to shows, sports, and other experiences. If you ask me if I’ll use them and enjoy them, the answer is almost always yes.

That said, I was pretty lucky in that I don't have debts: I got my Master's degree mostly for govt. funds due to good grades + started working in development during my 2nd year in Bachelor's. I am also pretty lucky that I don't have many expenses: I live in my dad's old city apartment and look after it (swapped out fridge and stove some time ago, new lightbulbs, lots of cleaning etc.), so day to day only have to cover utilities (~300 EUR) and no rent to speak of. I try to save and invest a decent chunk of whatever I earn, sometimes funds managed by my bank, sometimes specific company stocks, a relatively small amount in crypto as well. At the same time I spend some of my money helping my friends that are less fortunate than me, like with medical expenses or getting food near payday etc., since while I feel comfortable with a bit of a spartan lifestyle, them not being able to afford necessities sucks and it'd feel bad to do nothing. Aside from that, I do get some knickknacks sometimes, like how I'm getting an Aigo AIO for my PC (~60 EUR, not strictly necessary, but might help with the Ryzen 7 5800X, ~150 EUR, throwing a hissy fit whenever I make it compile things) and a new Modecom PSU (~50 EUR, the old one rattles a bit, might be bad bearings on its fan, probably a good idea to replace it and not risk it frying things at some point), some new clothes (~150 EUR) and the usual boring stuff (e.g. groceries are around 250-300 EUR a month over here). Also visiting Germany later this year (~1000 EUR) for a programming event and to hang out with some lovely people. Probably won't have: a fancy gaming PC, or flagship phones/laptops, a car in the near future, my own apartment in a newly built building even in the more far future, or any sort of living in luxury. At the same time, I much prefer either being able to help others and also having some financial stability over having the latest shiny thing. Unfortunately, despite not living in excess, it very much feels like I'm one financial crisis away from financial ruin. Fun times. reply",

          "text": "I like to figure skate. I'm not competitive at all, just like putting on some headphones and gliding around and working on new moves. It can be a bit expensive. I like that it's a bit social too as you see the same adults all the time and it's also great if you have kids as they can do their own thing and socialize. It's good for exercise and balance. It's prob over $200/month on group and private lessons when put together for me (I skate for 3-6 hours a week). Skates vary in cost from $150 for beginner skates (both boot and blades) to $400 for intermediate. At the upper end, boots are $1k by themselves and blades are $500+. Your skates last a good while though assuming you're not an Olympian. Hockey has similar costs, but you also have to spend ~$1500 on gear as an adult. reply",

I spend a very long time feeling quite poor, since it took a while for the company to be big enough to pay me a real salary. And if you have kids on a low salary, all of your money goes to absolutely the most basic necessities. In recent years, I have had just a little bit extra, and I found satisfaction in paying off debts and contributing to a retirement fund for the first time. I also bought ski passes for myself and my kids and we had many enjoyable days on the mountain. I have rich friends who own three houses and make over a million a year just from investments. They’re quite content, but the extra money doesn’t seem to buy them much extra satisfaction. reply",

What remains either sits in savings, put towards to developing another source of income, or spent on games and beer. I am fairly lucky in that I can do most things I want to. I can buy things that I want with a little saving. I can eat out with the family. I can't travel too much, though I'd like to. The only \"normal life\" expense I can't afford is buying a home. It seems a long way off. I think the path forward will be moving states or working remote, as there are few jobs in software near me. At least at my experience level. For now I cannot complain. My quality of life is higher than most I know. Off topic, but I think about this a lot. reply",

Members of our team spent years at the big platforms and ad networks, and we know exactly how broken it is. Now we're building something better – a platform that finally puts brands in control with AI that works for them, not against them. We recently raised our seed round led by Village Global (backed by Reid Hoffman, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg). Real customers are already using our product and seeing results. Your work will directly impact how fast we can scale this thing. What makes this interesting:\n • Daily work with cutting-edge AI tools, figuring out how to make them actually useful for marketers\n • Direct line to customers – you'll see your code impact real businesses immediately\n • Small team where your technical decisions matter and stick around We're looking for someone who's shipped backend systems at scale and either loves the startup chaos or is ready to dive in. You'll own features end-to-end and have real autonomy over technical direction. Python/MySQL/AWS/BigQuery is our current stack but we care more about your problem-solving approach.

          "text": "Solace Health | Various Roles | Remote (US Only) The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. When care gets delayed or denied, patients are often left with more questions than answers. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. Solace is a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces ....

We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team.

Rob worked at Fin (human-in-the-loop AI executive assistant, before LLMs) and was founding engineer at Substack. We started our first product, Substrate in 2023, a platform for building agentic workflows, and raised an $8M seed round led by Lightspeed [2]. We were pushing the envelope on both infra (serving multi-model workloads efficiently) and developer experience (ahead of our time in several ways) [3]. Though we found solid traction with startups, we realized inference was a red ocean especially upmarket, and decided to spin down the product/team at the end of 2024.

Radiologists are experts at diagnosing disease in medical images, but they spend over half their working hours on tasks that have nothing to do with diagnosis: reading prior reports, transcribing handwritten notes, taking manual measurements, dictating reports, and chasing down follow-ups. New Lantern is building an AI copilot for radiologists to automate this non-diagnostic work, so radiologists can focus on what they do best: caring for patients and interpreting images. We are starting to find product-market fit and recently raised a $19M Series A from Benchmark [2]. Demand for our product is growing, and we're hiring software engineers in San Francisco to help us scale our product and our team. We work together in person five days a week from our office in Jackson Square. Engineering is at the heart of New Lantern. Our engineers work directly with our founder/CEO, our staff radiologist, and our end users to build features that radiologists rely on daily. Everyone has real ownership and autonomy, moves quickly, and ships meaningful work frequently. We're a small, sharp team of frontend, full-stack, and backend engineers building a React-based web app backed by Python services, cloud infrastructure, and LLMs. I'm Steve, New Lantern's Head of Engineering. If you're interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai.

We have two of the largest self hosted ClickHouse clusters out there (and growing rapidly) each with Petabytes of data. We are working on really interesting solutions to problems that we would love to open source for the broader CH ecosystem: - Declarative, cluster aware migrations - Iceberg and S3 backed merge tree's on ClickHouse (as performant as local MergeTrees) - ClickHouse on K8s, but on Metal instances w/ NVMe used for caching and compaction. - Load shedding query scheduler and eventually query optimizer We have a broad charter when it comes to ClickHouse. It's one of the things that enables us to build so many products that share the same underlying data and context. Our goal is to enable all developers at PostHog to continue building these products quickly as the team and user-base scales. It's honestly an exciting time to be working at this company and on the beating heart of what drives it. Chat with me if you have any questions! reply",

          "text": "I repair practically anything that breaks in my house -- except heavy work on the car, or the roof. A few things, from me as a kid: 1. Take things apart, and try to figure out how they work. Don't worry too much about getting them back together. But then, trying to reassemble it is good practice too. There's plenty of old electronic junk that you can explore before throwing it away. Build a mental catalog of how things work and are assembled. Among other things, this will help you when you need to come up with a strategy for getting some particular gadget open -- often 9/10 of the problem. 2. Like others have said, YouTube is great. People will make a video of a repair, or even just getting something open, for a few \"likes.\" Also, most of them are just normal genuine people who aren't trying to be influencers, so it's kind of culturally refreshing. Many of my successful repairs started with YouTube, such as my clothes washer and dryer, refrigerator, lawn mower. 3. Many of my most cherished tools are what I call for \"demolition,\" not electronics specific, like picks, pry bars, a slim knife that can get between things, stuff like that. Another set of cherished tools are my magnifying visor, small magnifying glass, bright flashlight, and a stereo inspection microscope that I got second-hand. 4. A lot of \"electronic\" failures are actually mechanical in nature, and you can just use your general troubleshooting rundown to figure them out. Switches, connectors, cables, etc. 5. Begin to get the hang of identifying parts, and how part numbering schemes work. It will help you in your search for spares. 6. These days I often ask my spouse for a opinion. She's a laboratory scientist, quite sharp and skeptical. I'll have a hypothesis, and she asks the one question that blows it out of the water. Good luck! Don't get electrocuted or burn your house down. reply",

So it was basically, buy these capacitors, replace them, and off you go. Repair usually just requires basic soldering skills and the ability to put things back together you took apart. When the problem is not exactly the same, I'm just lost. There is not a lot of diagnosis videos on YouTube. All the videos are: \"1. I observed this problem. 2. [???] 3. I'll walk you through soldering on the new components.\" skipping the most important step 2. Same for car repair videos: \"I see Problem X happening. Problem X usually means component Y has failed. Here's how to replace component Y. The end.\" If that doesn't work, you wasted money on the part and your time ripping apart your car and putting it back together. reply",

He doesn't believe in slowly turning on things with old electrolytic capacitors, for example. I've learned quite a bit from him. I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts. (Only use 1 hand, keep the other behind you, always have a safety partner, etc) I've learned to hate Silver Mica capacitors. I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder. I'd suggest starting with something like an Arduino starter kit to get a sense of how components actually interact. But remember, if something is dead, you can't really make it worse.

Anything <50V can often just be fun tinker whatever assuming you're ok with breaking whatever you're playing with, up to a certain max amperage of your power source.

          "text": "The thing is that one needs understanding of an electrical engineer to debug circuits one wants to repair. When you have understanding you can do some voltage measurements and try to identify faulty part. There is gazillion different parts now, that wasn’t the case 2 decades ago. I know few people who repaired their washing machines just watching youtube videos. No skills and no knowledge. That’s the best error you can find - series error. All the appliances of the same manufacturer built in the 5 years will predictably fail and replacing 20 cent regulator revives the machine. There are then random faults, that need deep knowledge and hours of debugging. They’re not economically viable to repair unless the machinery is very expensive. Good example is 400€ transistor replacement in €20k Tektronix probe. Then there are things one shouldn’t touch - Tesla battery packs and open microwave ovens for example. Enough energy to kill or badly injure the unlucky hobbyists (in German): https://www.kosmo.at/tesla-akku-explodiert-mann-schwer-verle... There are enough analog electronics to repair what requires deep analog design knowledge. Music instruments and radio equipment might fall into this category. I would say, the repairs make no sense in the future that comes. With more and more electronics and programmable components the repairs are not economically viable. I am designing a motherboard with MPM54304 PMIC and a microprocessor. Both are programmed and without firmware sources and circuit diagram one will not able to recreate desired functionality. After product release I will organize workshop for my colleagues from service department and they will still come to me to discuss the repairs when some early faulty products will be send back by customers. reply",

Start with simple thing: A heater, a drill, etc. You won't learn much if you take apart complex gadget like smartphone. Also learn common failure mode: MLCC usually short itself, or old devices usually have dried out capacitor. For repairing equipment, you dont need high-end equipment from fluke or keysight. a cheap $20 DMM and $30 soldering iron will get you really far. Dont stick your hand into where you wont stick your D. reply",

          "text": "\"common failure mode\" = 'they break in a particular way a lot' As Randy Fromm says, \"the things that work the hardest fail the most\" Examples: MLCC (multi-layer ceramic capacitors) over time will often fail short. Older devices with electrolytic capacitors (the large can-shaped things often situated by where the power input is) have a liquid electrolyte in them that evaporates (boils off?) over time. When it does, they lose their capacitance and the power supply stops being able to supply (good) power. The point being, when something stops working, check these things first. It's like if your lawnmower dies on you, don't go pulling off the head to look at the piston. Check if there's gas in the tank first. Finally, a DMM is a digital multimeter. This is your basic tool to measure voltage, current resistance, capacitance, et c.) You can't do much troubleshooting without one. Hope this helps. reply",

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

What you need to learn for, say, a severe economic depression is different from the useful skills to survive a repressive government. If you look at the things people built in the 1930s, there was a lot of repurposing, make do and mend, etc, to get some basic function restored or working. Barbed wire telephones, that sort of thing. Kind of like the jugaad approach. Whereas surviving repression showed up as home brew radios, mimeograph machines made from cookie tins, etc. For electronics, maybe an understanding of circuits, how to desolder and resue chips, what the popular ones do, etc.? You wont be fixing the finer points of the surface mounted control board of your fancy miele washing machine, but you might at least get the drum to fill, spin, and drain. reply",

But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult.

          "text": "I've done a lot of tinkering and repair of home electronics and appliances and usually the problem is a blown fuse, bad connector, bad switch, worn out battery, or other simple problems. Stocking these items - connectors, switches, fuses, rechargeable batteries - will let you fix the most common problems. A lot of folks have given good advice on resources to learn about electronics and ways to practice, so I wanted to offer a little practical advice about tools and supplies that I've picked up over the years. Most important equipment is a multimeter and soldering station (with desoldering supplies), good wire cutters and strippers (I like the self-adjusting wire strippers for everything except very large and very small gauge wire), so I'll recommend a couple of additional tips I've learned; first, don't get an auto-ranging multimeter, especially cheap ones are usually not very good. I would also recommend one with a higher \"count\" like 6000 count, meaning the voltage and resistance measurements ranges go up to 6, meaning you have more range before you have to switch to the next higher range. Also, I want to really emphasize the importance of good soldering materials and technique - I prefer finer solder because it melts faster and requires less heat. It is easy to destroy some more sensitive items with too much heat. Learn to recognize a cold joint, make sure to use a good flux (I like liquid flux like kester 186). Keep a wet sponge at your station for cleaning the tip, remember to tin the tip, and use a fume extractor. Also, there are a variety of \"third hands\" you can get, I don't really like the small ones with two alligator clips and a magnifying glass, you can get ones with more clips that can hold more things, but a magnifying glass is really helpful (although it interferes with your depth perception) - I use a gooseneck magnifying glass with a built in light ring to help me solder. Make sure you have heat shrink tubing and a heat gun. These are great for finishing wires and much more durable than wrapping with electrical tape (although high quality electrical tape like super 33 is much better than the cheap stuff) Finally, when you're looking at a board, try to identify how the electricity will flow. Learn to identify the ground and vcc traces/planes on a pcb and test your theories with the multimeter (continuity mode on a powered off device is best for this). Build up a mental model of how the device works, and write down a circuit diagram. Seek to learn to identify common circuit patterns and what they are used for - decoupling caps, pull-up/pull-down resistors, ESD protection diodes, debouncing filters, level shifters, voltage dividers, op-amp configurations, serial headers (SPI, UART, JTAG, etc), transistor/mosfet/h-bridges. Learn to identify your ICs and look up the datasheets (I have found that taking a picture with flash with my phone is the best way to read hard-to-read IC labels) - the app notes will usually have a reference circuit with the necessary components, and you can use those to identify which components are related and why they're there. Good luck and have fun! reply",

          "text": "> I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. If you foresee supply chain or financial difficulties where you are, enough that people will need to keep old machines running... * Question: Are you thinking for keeping your family's device's working, and maybe teaching them?  Or for operating a primary business, or side business? * If you're currently financially comfortable, you might want to quickly learn what tools and supplies you'll need for several(?) years, and see whether they're currently available and inexpensive where you are.  (For example, temperature-controlled soldering irons, desoldering device or braid, a multimeter that has all the features you expect to need, misc. screwdrivers, many sizes and types of security bits, smartphone repair spudgers and suction cups, an assortment of various high-quality capacitors of various specs, an assortment of hookup wire, fuses.  Some common parts, like mains power cords, are easy to find from unfixable devices.) * Repairing power tools and small&large appliances, is a bit different than repairing old radios and televisions, is a bit different than new radios and televisions, is a bit different than older computers, is a bit different than newer computers. * If this includes keeping old computers working, you might want to think about what kinds, and what parts will wear out and be difficult to cannibalize.  For example, some laptop models will need their fans replaced eventually, and then maybe their keyboards.  Laptops made 15(?) years ago will soon need new backlight tubes and/or inverter boards, or new panels (possibly LED-backlit, plus the electronics to drive them).  Most PCs and laptops will need new thermal compound eventually, especially if you do some kinds of work on them.  Fortunately, most PC parts can be cannibalized easily. * Repairing smartphones requires special parts and supplies, and in some cases might be impossible.  You might think ahead to which ones you expect to want to repair, watch (and try to youtube-dl) the tutorial videos, and * For a business refurbishing old laptops, you might want to start saving repair PDFs now, in case the Internet gets fragmented.  For Lenovo/IBM ThinkPad laptops, search for \"Hardware Maintenance Manual\" and the model numbers. * Try to avoid IoT, and computers and software that depend on some company's servers to keep running.  And move to Linux (such as Debian Stable) if you haven't already.  WiFi routers should be running OpenWrt for security and longevity.  And consider whether you want to focus on a particular ecosystem of smartphone and tablet (iOS, proprietary Android, \"alternative firmware\" Android) that you expect to be able to source enough devices for and keep working. reply",

I've been designing electrical hardware for robots for the last 4 years for a big corporation and I can tell you, the fun and money is in the software but having another skill is awesome. Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow. Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project. If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper. As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank. Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are. And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective. reply",

In order to get meaningful practice in all of these areas, I would recommend re-implementing a robot vacuum from 'scratch'. The actual vacuum part is non-essential, as you're really trying to implement the famous 'turtle' robot and experience all the design steps/compromises/challenges first hand. As a goal, aim for autonomous navigation around your home that works equivalently to a cheap 'throwaway' robo-vac. Keep in mind you are surrounded by robotics. Most passenger vehicles, consumer drones, micro-mobility devices and modern construction equipment are 'robots in varying degrees of disguise'. Practical knowledge regarding any of these systems transfers well if you know where to apply it. reply",

Robots like anymal from anybotics, spot from boston dynamics or the unidog from unitree to name a few don't use PLC at all due to lack of space. Also energy efficiency, mcu at most will push less than a watt to move something complex, a motor control for the FOC, I mentioned earlier. I worked for the past 4 years in HP siteprint.The main problem was developing all to fit inside a pelican case that you could check in on a plane. The smallest PLC was almost the full internal volume of the robot.

Don't bother with a Jetson Nano, you don't need that to get started, and by the time you need that you'll know a lot already. You can just drive the robot from your laptop! Getting to training your own VLA fine-tuned model is a super quick and easy process. You can see examples of other people completing the tutorial and uploading their training/evaluation datasets here (shameless plug for my thing): https://app.destroyrobots.com I wouldn't bother much with ROS at first tbh.

          "text": "This is by far one of the best ways to learn IMO https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_a... The idea of that game is that you build vehicles to do rescues and deal with natural disasters. While there is a career mode where you gain currency that you can spend on parts and fuel, most people who play that game play it in sandbox mode where you essentially design vehicles to do certain things, while also configuring the game to chose missions it generates. For example, you can make it so you only have to deal with land rescue missions or only fight enemy ai. The building system is VERY in depth.  While you don't have to worry about structural strength, you do have to keep things in mind like part placement, CG location, internal volume for buoyancy for ships. Then you get to propulsion, which you have to build out of components - the game has a fairly indepth internal combustion engine simulator where you build custom engines, and have to make sure they are fed with adequate fuel, air, and cooled appropriately. You can do jet engines, you can do nuclear, you can do full electric, and so on. Then you have to build systems to do missions - for example, to transport a container you have to build a crane to be able to pick it up. Finally, the game features a microcontroller system which is the bread and butter of doing cool things. There is a bunch of sensors that can read data (GPS, laser distance, pitch, roll, heading, radar, e.t.c), which you can route into a microcontroller, and do math either with logic blocks or Lua code, and thats how you build automation. You will get very familiar with things like PID controller tuning, trigonometry math (for things like distance sensing), state machine coding practices, and other things that are all applicable to the real world. reply",

          "text": "Two bits of advice: just jump in, and set reasonable expectations for yourself. Robotics is a field filled with layers upon layers of complexity, theory, and real-world problems. Those at the top of the game (think robust dog robots, walking bipedal star wars droids, high-speed and high-torque many-DOF arm platforms) are leveraging learnings and expensive prototypes from decades of work/research to achieve those feats. This is not to be discouraging, but to say - they all started somewhere - you too can start, and maybe you won't build things like that today, but you can get there. And the cool thing is all that robotics work by experts has made the barrier to entry much lower - today you can choose to apply money to solve problems you don't want to learn and focus on the things you do want to learn, in ways that weren't possible 10 years ago. Need a powerful closed loop motor system? Buy an ODrive or closed-loop stepper platform off the shelf, and focus on how to apply those systems to build something higher level. But the big difference with learning hardware/robotics compared to software (speaking from experience having watched a lot of really smart people struggle to get robots working when I ran an MIT robotics competition, 6.270, and was a lab assistant for another course, 6.141) is that the real world is unforgiving in a way that software is generally not. So if you come from a software background, you will find that robotics can have so many more setbacks because nothing ever moves/behaves/reacts in a precisely predictable way in physical space. This is why I say just jump in - you'll have fun learning all the ways things go wrong, and they faster you get that learning out of the way, the sooner you can build things that work reliably! Try things and figure out how and why they don't work, and iterate. But don't set unrealistically high expectations or it will just be frustrating. reply",

          "text": "I couldn't agree more. FIRST is an excellent organization to get involved with. Even if you don't have specialities which directly align with the needs of a team, most will not turn you away (especially if you demonstrate passion). Just a few thoughts about starting a team and/or volunteering: Starting a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team is not for the feint-of-heart and requires significant time and money investment. This is the sort of endeavor you try when you're either retired or have a group of other dedicated volunteers willing to help you build the team over multiple seasons. If you spend a year or two mentoring/volunteering for a well-established team, you'll get a good sense of what you're getting into. FRC is a bit hardcore. If no FRC teams exist nearby, FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a good entrypoint, but may not be technical enough for an adult interested in using FIRST to gain exposure to robotics. (It is plenty satisfying to mentor these teams, but Mindstorms can be somewhat limiting.) These are geared toward using Lego Mindstorms for learning robot concepts. A good middle ground (for exposure to more practical robotics) would be volunteering with a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. It's the middle ground between FLL and FRC and is _doable_ for a single, dedicated, passionate adult to start (though I'd strongly recommend finding another volunteer to pursue this with). If getting involved with a team is not an option, seek out nearby FIRST events that you can volunteer at. Many competition events need volunteers and you'll get a chance to interact with local teams and find plenty of opportunities to play with robots. reply",

          "text": "From the electronics side, the path towards control theory is a lot of math (signals and systems, Fourier transforms, transfer functions, feedback and oscillations, compensation circuits) ultimately leading up to the student solving the inverted pendulum problem sometimes in early Masters degree region or maybe the advanced student Bachelor's degree. I'm not entirely sure how to make that more 'accessible'. It's like, spend the next 5 years of your life mastering difficult math and electronics so that the sensors can be integrated into feedback that stabilizes a motor system. I guess you can cheat and use servos for a lot of this (where an EE already solved many feedback loop issues). But if you ever need to build your own sensor+motor solution you'd get stuck if you didn't know the math. ------- Making simple controls without relying upon feedback sensors is likely the goal, you can do a lot with that. But then do your best to avoid the Masters level demons that plague this problem set. Maybe learn PID controller theory and if that isn't enough for your problems, give up and try a different design. PID is simple enough that you won't need years of math to learn, but it's very adhoc to configure and not always the best methodology to use. Better than nothing though. reply",

Think of how hard it is to walk normally when your leg has fallen asleep --- your visual cues remain unchanged, but you lose the immediate feedback loop from your leg.  You can do it, but your gait is very unnatural and inefficient. reply",

Very capable robots are in that range at this point. 1.Figure out what you want the robot to do. This is the hardest part, cause it requires constraining your desires considerably 2. Figure out how you want to make it do that. Do you want a deterministic robot? Do you want a robot that uses inference? 3. Then buy the robot that can do the physical action. If your task is to move groceries from your car into the house, you have much different requirements than if its a linear actuator flipping a static switch 4. Choose your robotic actuation path: Dedicated embedded controller (FPGA, PLC), controller coupled with another switch, autopilot etc… Test, iterate, test…. reply",

I make robots like this (that one's just to enter the wiring stage) using alu extrusion beams, some 3D printing, off-the-shelf servos and SBCs: https://i.imgur.com/9YIHT9P.jpeg Modern SBCs are decently powerful and run for long enough off a standard drone LiPo pack that you can fairly easily build yourself a solid little platform to learn and experiment with different controller approaches. Stereo cams, LiDAR modules, etc. are also readily available at a quality level that is decent enough. You'll quickly realize the amount of work needed to bring any of the more advanced approaches to a productization level, but a \"I implemented enough of this to get the principle\" mini-Boston-Dynamics is in reach of the hobbyist. In fact, the programming craft aspect of all of this is relatively simple. Basic implementations are typically not architecturally complex or a lot of sloc. You'll find that it's more about learning some control theory, and it'll also get you into machine learning. reply",

          "text": "A really top-tier robotics engineer is going to be a generalist across mechanical, electrical, and several software domains, and then also a specialist, deep expert in one or two of those. So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours. I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons. reply",

It's much like using packages in software. Maybe they aren't perfect fits for what you're building, but they get you close enough. You can refine later once you know the system works.

Crunch labs: https://www.crunchlabs.com/ As someone in the industry (I literally can call myself a Robot Master having a Masters Degree in Robotics), these simple “kid kits” are phenomenal. When you first start out, the hardest part is knowing the hardware is actually going to do what you tell it to do. Simplifying the mechanical engineering/electrical engineering so you can immediately create real world actions makes a huge difference in giving you motivation to keep going. Once you have the basics in place and you understand mechanisms, sensors, and some algorithms, you can move on to other parts of robotics. However, keep in mind robotics is really about system thinking… you have to understand trades between sensing, thinking, and acting. But most importantly you have to remember you are dealing with the real world… you can’t as easily write a unit test and know that a particular actuator will behave exactly the same way every time. reply",

          "text": "There are many ways to start with a more academic knowledge of robotics. Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care. It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch. This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot. As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more \"formal\" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist. My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT! For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for <$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive. For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all. For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running. As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach. reply",

If you want to make it in robotics, you're going to have to read research papers and preferably have attended as many robotics related courses during university as possible. The hobbyist scene is big, but the vast majority of robots are basically fancy toys and almost no one ever goes beyond simple PID. The problem is that robotics is clustered around industrial robots and academia with nothing in-between. Unless you have the necessary background, you will most likely be stuck scraping the surface simply because you're not aware of the most recent developments in those areas. reply",

For simple DIY projects I'd start with getting an Arduino or Arduino compatible board and just play around with building things with sensors, LEDs, motors, etc. You'll find lots of kits and resources online for simple Arduino projects. More complex projects are probably going to need to be Linux-based (AI, machine vision, etc). In which case you might want to look at building something with a mini PC, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson. These days robotics is super accessible, but can cost a bit depending on what you want to do... That said, most of the time you'll find there are cheap ways to build POCs to validate your ideas first. reply",

I'm Maximilian Vidavsky. I am a backend dev and technical writer based in Central PA. I've been coding since I was 13, and I have a wealth of personal projects under my belt, as well as a Mitacs internship that I beat 5 other PhD candidates for. Most of my experience is with Python, and I have significant coursework in C and SQL, but I am willing to learn any language or technology for the job. My personal interests as of late include reverse engineering, making Telegram bots, and writing documentation/deep-dive articles. As I have just graduated, I am eager to get into the workforce. At my last internship, I created the world's largest diamond dissolution database, and I estimate that I have saved over $500,000 of staff time with it. I feel a bit anxious to be posting alongside such great developers as an entry-level junior, but I feel like my breadth of knowledge lets me be a useful multi-tool that can be thrown at any task. Given enough time and resources, I can solve almost any problem! reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package... ), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

I am Donovan Preston. I first became heavily involved with programming and open source software through the Twisted Python project. I then went on to work on the bulk of the early code for eventlet. Python asyncio is now a part of the standard library, and I like to think that these projects influenced the direction of async programming in Python. Later, I worked for Mozilla Research and then the Mozilla Services organizations. I helped with a project called dom.js (which now lives on as domino), implemented TCP and UDP apis for Firefox OS, worked on several experiments such as Firefox Screenshots (main developer at the beginning of the project) and Firefox Send (on the Android port). Finally, I worked on the port of the Firefox Sync server from Python to Rust. I gained extensive experience with ES.Next, React, TypeScript, and Rust. Now, I have a small consultancy and have worked on several Swift apps, in addition to HTML/CSS and full stack web applications. I am looking to work on a team again and in-person is preferrable, although remote is ok. reply",

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying.

The problem with browser automation is that it requires communication between environments that don't often communicate with each other. Currently, I’ve been working on a specialized project involving IPC and RPC across distributed JavaScript environments. This includes implementing RPC over WebRTC with packet acknowledgment. The system provides a unified API interface that works seamlessly across service workers, web workers, Node.js servers, and Unix pipes, among other environments. If that sounds like something you could use, please reach out — I’d be happy to share more about myself and my work. reply",

I have 15 years of web experience building CMS and CRM for small and large companies. As a co-founder (as well as my prior years), I wore many hats and spent countless hours as a result I can architect and design large codebases, hire and retain talent, lead and manage teams and set company-wide goals. I built and managed an engineering team located all around the globe and built a platform empowering small and medium businesses to run their operations; the company is entering a new phase of growth and it is the right time for me to find opportunities that aligns with my personal goals. I am looking for a role at an established company. The bigger the problem, the more exciting. A perfect role for my profile may be one that blends my experience of building a successful B2B2C startup (building teams, product and software) and my experience of building B2B tools at a large company (Twitter). If you need someone that can be an immediate value-add, bringing a ton of firepower, solving big problems and rallying teams to move mountains: hit me up! reply",

We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

          "text": "I know of a guy, but his scenario was quite unique. I was working for an energy company who shall remain nameless, but who's internal IT was a tangle of external consultants milking the place for millions, and ineffective/underserved full time staff who couldn't run a query on a database without a change control committee of consultants milking them for yet more cash. Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage. Then, as far as I know, he sat back and just watched the money roll in while he automated everything else about the job. reply",

I guess check your employment contracts and whatnot, but it's very common for people to leave a company and start consulting and/or freelancing in the expertise they gained at that company. And it's not too uncommon for former employers to be one of their first clients or get your first clients from relationships associated with your former employer. All of this assumes you don't burn bridges and have the interpersonal skills, in-demand expertise, luck, timing, and interest in building out a small service-based business. reply",

I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo. What I wish I knew: don't use RapidAPI. They charge 20%, they have a terrible interface, and they let customers run up huge charges and walk away without paying anything.

I don't fully understand this statement. the economic player with direct contact to the customer \"owns\" the customer and has a lot of power in negotiation with suppliers. the customer-facing players have the most information about their customers, and can offer adjacent products (want fries with that?) Uber and Lyft make big money, not their drivers. Amazon and Ebay make big money, not their sellers. McDonalds makes more money than their food suppliers, and franchisees. The exception is with something like intellectual property, let's use movies as an example. The owners of the content want to sell it widely and will do a variety of distribution deals for different distribution channels. However, if any distribution channel starts taking a big slice of the money pie, the terms of the contract renewal will be changed because without the content they are dead. reply",

But Spotify came along and proved people are ready to pay for something better. ImageMagick is an open source tool for resizing images etc. But some people successfully build API services or SaaS-services on top of it. It works because people AND businesses pay for convenience. What space do you have knowledge of? What pains do people have in that domain that can be solved with tech? Always start with the problem. And start with an industry you know by heart or customer profile you truly care for. For me that was software developers. I was that customer myself.

          "text": "We connect directly with the operators using the protocols of their choice. Mostly IP-based protocols such as SMPP, SIP, MM7 and various kinds of VPN/TLS technology. Very custom contracts and back in 2011 when we started there was no such thing as a virtual mobile phone number. These days the operators are a bit more aware of the value of A2P (application-to-person) versus P2P which was/is very much on the decline. That also means the operators have capacity built of ready to be used without new investments. As for our own software, we are mostly a Python based shop. And we use tons of open source. The most heavily used components we replace over time with cusomized software as these are generally fully not suited for our needs. The true value for our customers is our technical support, our operator conectivity, the robustness of the platform, and lastly the nice REST API with it’s debugging capability. reply",

It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

          "text": "8 year old badly wants to be an engineer like his dad. :’) Public school got him into Scratch so he was animating things. The high school robotics team I mentor has Lego robotics kits for their community outreach program. Those kits use Scratch. So I got him a used kit and he spends an absolutely ridiculous amount of time making robots that do stuff. This started at a very young age: we gave him access to a windows PC, not a tablet. So by 3 he could log in and get to YouTube kids. This meant that keyboard and mouse and web browser were very comfortable concepts. We also gave him and his younger brother countless building toys. Meccano. Lego Technic. A few lessons I’d love to empart: - you can’t make your kid into this. His younger brother has no interest and is far more about sports. So we nurture that with him instead. - open ended learning. I’m not sitting down and teaching him.  All I do is make sure he has access to the tools, and I unstick him when he’s stuck. - I connect concepts when I see them. “That’s called a loop. It’s just like that thing you did in Minecraft to make your machine work over and over again.” - the learning must all be a side effect of having fun. Don’t try to teach programming. Do fun things and fill in the programming toolbox, tool by tool, as they’re needed. - connect programming to what your kid is passionate about. Programming is a means to an end, not the end itself.  My kid loves trains and has a Lego train set. I suggested he use his technic to automate the track switch. I then let him work at it for hours and hours over weeks, giving him breadcrumbs of what to consider next. reply",

Example: don’t tell them what a for loop is, make a project where they really need it, but let them first to write it very verbosely without loops, then they will almost invent it themselves and be relived when you teach them (same style can be applied to most things) - make projects that have low entry level, but where they can improve it infinitely. E.g. build an aquarium simulator or a city simulator using p5.js - make them collaborate with other kids if possible, often they learn better from their peers than listening to their parents. Facilitate collaboration, and help them come up with more and more difficult projects, that require more and more of them, so they don’t stay on the same level too long reply",

          "text": "I taught kids how to code for several years, both in person and through a website that taught Python to ~500k kids. My eternal advice with teaching CS is to delay abstractions as long as possible . Teach them how to draw a circle on a canvas, then get them to move the circle to different parts of the canvas, then get them to draw multiple overlapping circles/rectangles/etc. Once you've got that down, make a bouncing ball animation, simple games, and so on. Most kids don't really care for leetcode problems these days, so it's best to stick to things that are visual, creative, and instant-feedback (i.e. games). This was a really useful realization when I was teaching kids to code in person for ~5 years. I started off teaching Java with an abstraction layer ( https://www.bluej.org/ ), but I found that many students would be intimidated by anything that ventured outside of the abstraction (e.g. just run `javac` on your computer with a `.java` file). My most successful students intuitively understood how to turn a text file on their computer into a useful piece of compiled code, or into a JAR bundle that they could share with others. They also used the various abstractions that were thoughtfully introduced over time - e.g. an IDE that gives you a run button, libraries like Firebase which enable some exciting multiplayer game options, and so on. reply",

Just last night, while looking for clear technical information about MCP integration options for Gemini, I found this Google-written article[1], that -- with a positive, hype-compliant spin -- opens with: > Have you ever had something on the tip of your tongue, but you weren’t exactly sure how to describe what’s in your mind? > For developers, this is where \"vibe coding \" comes in. Vibe coding helps developers achieve their vision with models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate code from natural language prompts. Instead of writing every line of code, developers can now describe the desired functionality in plain language. AI translates these \"vibes\" into your vision. That's not thinking. We've even appropriated \"vibe\" terminology, which means something like emotional gut feel, without having to think about it.  (Mostly associated with wake-and-bake stoners, who've self-imposed two-digit IQs and munchies, and who will sometimes speak in terms of \"vibes\", for lack of further analytic capacity.) Recognizing that the top killer app for \"AI\" right now is cheating on homework, the collaborate-with-AI 'skill' is like the well-known collaborate-with-lab-partner.  The lab partner who does all the work, while the slacking student learns nothing, and therefore the slacker fails the exam.  (But, near-term, the slacker might scrape by with a C- for the class, due to copying the lab portion, and due to an instructor who now just wants to be rid of the hopeless student.)

This isn't really some new concept, the only thing new is that it's being applied to areas that haven't historically had a ton of automation. Hand-wringing about LLMs and \"not thinking\" is the same thing that was hand-wrung about students using calculators and not knowing how to do long division. Or using a computer lookup and not knowing how to use the dewey decimal system. Heck, or using an automobile/bicycle and not knowing how to shoe a horse. People over the last decade have demonstrated they are perfectly capable of generating large quantities of crappy, not-thought-out code all on their own. Just look around you. LLMs democratize the lowest common denominator, and those that are doing sufficiently difficult, nuanced, unique things that they actually need to know what they're doing, will continue to do so. I don't think LLMs will reduce the abilities of the 10% best software engineers, and I don't think the quality of output of the rest will meaningfully change. reply",

And when they can't independently invent a concept or technique that they need for something they're building, you can nudge them.  (Example: Their 2D video game screen refreshes are too slow, and now they would be excited to be introduced to double-buffering.  And now they'll know exactly why they need it and how it works.  So, the next time they need a related graphics improvement, they've had that prior learning experience, and might be able to figure it out on their own.)

How do you convince that child that he doesn't need the shiny flashy thing the ads are trying to sell and just needs to sit down and learn real coding? reply",

          "text": "In my experience, most of the time when kids say they want to make games, that doesn't mean they want to code them. Making a game is usually not a task done by a lone coder. It is a task done by someone who can manage different technical, creative and business types. I think kids want to have ideas. This creativity can be captured by coding, maybe, but maybe there are better outlets for the individual. The director of street fighter 5, for example, started as a music composer. I think it's important to really understand our kids. They may not have the experience or vocabulary to have this discussion. Wanting to make a game and coding are different things. You're on the right path in terms of breaking things down into smaller, solvable problems. Coding might be part of it, but translatable skills to making a game might also include leading a band, making a short film, playing team sports, etc. reply",

Just my two cents: if your kids aren't very interested or ready for that kind of knowledge now, you might find that in a few years they can learn it surprisingly quickly if they're interested then.

          "text": "I have 3 kids, all around the same age (K/1). They all got laptops about 18 months ago for christmas. I installed mint linux on all of them, and installed a few free/libre games for them to play, and I self-host the game server at home. One game they play is luanti (formerly minetest). I gave them instructions on how to clone the git repository for the game, run the build script, and then start the game. They've probably forgotten the build instructions, but they know to play, they have to type `cd code/minetest` and then `bin/luanti`. Occasionally they have to run `git pull` to update the code on their computers. I handle all the game server administration. I initially blocked all internet access with a kill switch, but this quickly became an issue because you need to be able to run `apt update` and a few other commands to keep the system up to date. So now I run a proxy server called e2guardian that lets them access sites that I choose. Later, I introduced them to scratch, and I downloaded the entirely of griffpatch's youtube library with yt-dlp and organized it into folders on each of  their computers. I've done the same thing with other tutorial style videos. They don't have access to youtube, and I don't really think it makes sense to give them access at this age. They run scratch locally, as opposed to using scratch.mit.edu. I enabled the scratch website for a couple of days as a treat for them, and as expected, they spent most of the time exploring and playing others' games, but very little time building their own. I sort of expected this to happen, so we closed off access a few days later, and they took some of the ideas they saw online and started playing with them locally. So my experience is: a) linux makes a great platform for kids, since it's very easy to tweak things to stop behaviors that you don't want to reinforce. e.g. `sudo chmod 400 /usr/local/games` turns off all the games, `sudo killall kidname` will close the desktop session if your kid isn't listening when it's time for bed, you can set up time-based login policies with pam_time, you can install your own root certificates for SSL MITM, etc. b) games reinforce that \"computers are fun\", and games like luanti are free, open-source, and hackable. c) interest in games naturally spills over into interest in making your own games. If you want to try luanti/minetest, I recently cleaned up/released a mod that I built for the kids last year called turtlebots. It's a visual programming tool that lets you program little turtle-shaped robots that can navigate in a minecraft-style world and build things as they move around.

          "text": "It's important to remember that the exercise of teaching children coding isn't so much about teaching them how to code, but how to think, how to plan, predict, conjecture, reason and so forth. It's just a convenient and quicker way of teaching these things than the alternatives. If they have a good foundation in these things, then if they choose to go on to coding later they can learn all of the minutiae. But I've found in teaching it is important to stress that learning basic coding is _not_ about steering them towards coding as a career, or even a pursuit. It _is_ important to stress that learning basic coding will help them become better problem solvers, better able to anticipate issues and mitigate them. And that this is useful to them in a wide variety of areas in which they may have interest, such as sports, engineering, adventuring etc. And yes, also learning how to guide an LLM. So once you get those fundamentals down in the context of coding (Scratch, GameMaker, Logo, BASIC are all fine here), go practice them in more real-world applications. Those are the skills you need to foster, not object-oriented programming. And if they take an interest in going further with coding, then that's fine. They will have the tools they need to do that. reply",

OP just has to start downloading and trying them out. With 16GB one can do partial DDR5 offloading with llama.cpp and run anything up to about 30B (even dense) or even more at a \"reasonable\" speed for chat purposes. Especially with tensor offload. I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards. Gemma 3s are great but a bit unhinged. And of course QwQ when you need GPT4 at home. And probably lots of others I'm forgetting. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

          "text": "This is of course true is some cases and less true in others. I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you. But I'm still happy to hang out here and get into (hopefully) illuminating discussions. reply",

I'd be shocked if they (you?) were banned just for critiquing Musk. So please link the post. I'm prepared to be shocked. I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive.

Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful.

It's really hard to say one model is better than another in a general way, since it depends on so many things like your use case, the prompts, the settings, quantization, quantization method and so on. If you're building/trying to build stuff depending on LLMs in any capacity, the first step is coming up with your own custom benchmark/evaluation that you can run with your specific use cases being put under test.

I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

          "text": "I completely disagree. I don't see the current status quo fundamentally changing. That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results.

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

Personally I've found it's really useful that it provides the details portions of course study materials for examples slides that's directly related to the discussions so the students can check the sources veracity of the answers provided by the LLM.

Think of it as a full blooded product, instead of trying to squeeze it into the SaaS thinking model you've got already. Plenty of enterprise (and such) clients wouldn't balk at all at a $500 fee. Brainstorm your target market and price accordingly. In other comments, you're mentioning the support burden - I don't think you should sell the offline version if you're not ready to lift that burden, and thus should price it in a way where this is attractive to you. Offline versions are usually used by more demanding customers in the current day and age - the web is where you go for the user-friendly version. reply",

          "text": "If I may suggest Steve Gibson's method, Spinrite. One-time purchase. I bought it once. It 'lives' on a usb-stick, offline. If I lose it I can download it again. I bought it at v4.x or v5.x (I don't remember, it's been years). I've paid for the upgrade to 6.0. The upgrade from 6.0 to 6.1 was free (and very significant). When he moves it to v7, I will happily pay for that upgrade as well. I don't know if I am a cheap bastard (perhaps I am) but I prefer to pay-it forward. I buy a 'lifetime' subscription for the things I want _a lot_ and/or need. I remember a decade ago I paid $200 for a SaaS when the monthly rate was $20. I use it a few times per year (so let's say it would cost me $40 to reactive-use-deactivate). I got the lifetime at 10x, I broken even after 4-5 years. I paid the folks 10x when they needed the funding (and offered the 'lifetime'), and they 'thank' me by having me on 'for free'. That said, I did take the risk, because if that SaaS was dishonest or simply they would have gone bust, I'd lose the 90% of that payment, but the amount was small ($200 for a lifetime service is a small amount for an EU costs/standard of living). reply",

How is it enforced? * Does the team set arbitrary definitions and measures or does the team make determinations according to multiple factors? This question is deceptive. It’s almost always better to have things defined in writing, even if wrong, than to frequently defer to ad hoc qualifiers. * If after fully onboarding I have a tremendous amount of availability where would you like to see that time invested? * If this is a consultancy how do I identify the principal stakeholders at the client and what are their success criteria? It’s often not about making the client happy but accelerating the client towards some goal not immediately clear within the consultancy. * What are their success criteria currently technical constraints on the team that determines velocity?

I have a (few years old) copy of Library Genesis converted to plaintext and it's around 1TB. I think libgen proper was 50-100TB at the time, so we can probably assume that AA (~1PB) would be around 10-20TB when converted to plaintext. You'd probably spend several weeks torrenting a chunk of the archive, converting everything in it to plaintext, deleting the originals, then repeating with a new chunk until you have plaintext versions of everything in the archive. Then indexing all that for full text search would take even more storage and even more time, but still perfectly doable on commodity hardware. The main barriers are going to be reliably extracting plaintext from the myriad of formats in the archive, cleaning up the data, and selecting a decent full text search database (god help you if you pick wrong and decide you want to switch and re-index everything later). reply",

They never hosted a copyrighted byte but they're banned in some form (DNS, IP, domain seizures) in many countries.

          "text": "(I worked at a different processing company, which I am not speaking for.) We're struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). The highest likelihood for me is that they're doing card/credential testing. They have either stolen or purchased a large number of stolen credentials. Those credentials are worth more individually if they are known to function. They can use any business on the Internet which sells anything and would tell someone \"Sorry, can't sell you that because I couldn't charge your account/card/etc. Do you have another one?\" to quickly winnow their set of credentials into a pile of ones which haven't been canceled yet and another pile. Another variation of this attack is their list is \"literally just enumerate all the cards possible in a range and try to sift down to the cards that actually exist.\" After sifting through to find the more valuable cards, they sell this onto another attacker at higher price of the mixed-working-and-not-working cards, or they pass it to their colleague who will attempt to hit the cards/creds for actual money. Digital items are useful because people selling them have high margins and have lower defenses against fraud as a result. Cheap things, especially cheap things where they can pick their price, are useful because it is less likely to trigger the attention of the card holder or their bank. (This is one reason charities get abused very frequently, because they will often happily accept a $1 or lower donation, even one which is worth less than their lowest possible payment processing cost.) The bad guys don't want to be noticed because the real theft is in the future, by them or (more likely) by someone they sell this newly-more-valuable card information onto. This hit the company I used to run back in the day, also on Paypal, and was quite frustrating. I solved it by adding a few heuristics to catch and giving a user matching those heuristics the product for free, with the usual message they got in case of a successful sale. This quickly spoils your website for the purpose they're trying to use it for, and the professional engineering team employed to abuse you experiences thirty seconds of confusion and regret before moving to the next site on their list. Back in the day, the bad guys were extremely bad at causing their browser instance to even try to look like a normal user in terms of e.g. pattern of data access prior to attempting to buy a thing. Hope some of that is useful. Best of luck and skill. You can eventually pierce through to Paypal's attention here and they may have options available contingent on you being under card/credential testing attack, or they might not. I was not successful in doing so back in the day prior to solving the problem for myself. Would also recommend building monitoring so you know this is happening in the future before the disputes roll in. Note that those disputes might be from them or from the legitimate users depending on exactly what credentials they have stolen, and in the case they are from legitimate users, you may not have caught all of the fraudulent charges yet. (Mentioning because you said \"all of the charges\" were disputed.) If I were you I'd try to cast a wider net and pre-emptively refund or review things in the wider net, both because the right thing to do and also because you may be able to head off more disputes later as e.g. people get their monthly statements. reply",

          "text": "This is a money laundering scheme where they are trying out how far they can go per domain. It's also a bug in the paypal API that they're abusing, where the SDK doesn't differ between example.com and www.example.com. If webshops like yours get exploited and used for money laundering, they will mix transactions from those two subdomains, while leaving the www.example.com domain as it is. The support people at paypal are dumb enough to not take care about each case, and usually they mix transactions later also via other social media services that have microtransactions (e.g. tiktok or snapchat streams where you can gift away items). The way paypal support's workflow works is that they have to nanually identify each and every transaction separately, meaning a human will be busy for weeks on end. Not kidding you. That's how the scammers keep winning with schemes like this. Usually there's also no way to escalate this, not even for business customers, at paypal, due to how their support offices are structured organizationally. As a mitigation I'd recommend to block ASNs that are known hosters that do this, and double check your webshop version for known vulnerabilities and fixes. If you don't use docker already, start to virtualize your webshop software now. I can't stress how important this is. Also double check any users and passwords you are using for the services, and the rest of the filesystem for indicators on the VPS. Disable SSH passwords and use only SSH key authentication on the VPS in case this hasn't been done already. I'm writing this because usually this kind of scheme starts to happen after the server got pwned already, and after e.g. the ssh password bruteforce scanner was successful or after the web exploit / persistence exploit was successful. If you need a starting point to block those botnet affiliated networks, I started both a firewall and scam database project that does exactly this: [1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam [2] https://github.com/tholian-network/firewall reply",

It's very easy to misconfigure it: - The Docker daemon runs as root: any user in the docker group effectively also has sudo (--privileged) - Ports exposed by Docker punch through the firewall - In general, you can break the security boundary towards root (not your user!) by mounting the wrong things, setting the wrong flags etc. What Docker primarily gives you is a stupid (good!) solution for having a reproducible, re-settable environment.\nBut containers (read: magic isolated box) are not really a good tool to reason about security in Linux imo. If you are a beginner, instead make sure you don't run services as the sudo-capable/root user as a first step.\nThen, I would recommend you look into Systemd services: you can configure all the Linux sandboxing features Docker uses and more.\nThis composes well with Podman, which gives you a reproducible environment (drop-in replacement for Docker) but contained to an unprivileged user. reply",

Since he’s the one buying he doesn’t need to deliver anything but he gets the money from a legit source. Usually he would use a payment method as close to money as possible so that it leaves less traces. But in OPs case, the amounts are low so he needs too many transactions to get something valuable. And because of the disputes, he’s (probably) not getting the money (?). It could be card testing: the fraudster has a bunch of cards and doesn’t know which is valid or canceled. The best way to find out is to test in a real site. So he’ll test out each of them and the ones that go through are good to use elsewhere. The thing is that it would be better for him not to dispute the transactions so the OP would take much longer to find out about the scheme and shut it down. It’s better to use low amount transactions in this case so it doesn’t use too much of the credit available for him to defraud and probably doesn’t warn the card owner. Another option is doing it just to hurt the OP marketplace. If you have too many disputes the brands can fine you and if you don’t solve the problem they can turn your account off. I’ve seen it happen when a competitor was trying to hurt the e-commerce. It’s a low move and rare but it happens. One thing that might help is to analyze the sellers too.

Their support sucks and is completely unhelpful, managing your account was at the time extremely complex, compared any other payment solution. Our rule taking PayPal: Transfer EVERYTHING out of your PayPal account on a daily basis, do not let them hold your funds, they will block you from accessing it at some point. Minimize what they can touch. Also don't all smaller amounts to be paid with PayPal. This prevents you from being abused as a source for verifying stolen accounts. The only company I dealt with that came close to the same level of incompetency was Klarna. Klarna didn't at the time understand the concept of fraud, because they're Swedish and their system in Sweden MOSTLY prevented fraud at the time. Once people found away around that and Klarna expanded beyond Sweden, they gave up and attempted to stick the bill on us, despite their contracts clearly stated that they where responsible for collecting payments. reply",

Be willing to temporarily suspend your services in order to prevent the malicious behavior. Do the manual work to allow genuine customers to keep using your service, e.g: require manual account approval. You need to treat every one of these chargeback transactions as a risk to your businesses ability to operate, each that you allow to happen increases the risk of permanent damage to your business. Reach out to your account manager at PayPal, this is not something that should be going via frontline support. You need to be talking to a person who knows and is responsible for your account. If you don’t have one, get one. If you can’t get one, look for anti payment fraud businesses that work with PayPal, they may be able to get a direct line to PayPal on your behalf. For the future, if you’re dependent upon a service provider you should always have someone you can reach out to directly. If a provider isn’t willing to offer that, find a different provider. Financial services especially are very risk averse and will jettison your account if they get even a whiff of something untoward, whether you tried to prevent it or not. The cost of recovering from that will dwarf the cost of any drastic mitigation you take now. Losing your PayPal account is worse than turning off purchases for a few days. reply",

The more we spread those around online, the higher the chance they get stolen and used, probably in refund scams like the one OP describes.

It’s ridiculous how crypto gets so much hate here, yet there are constant, often heart wrenching posts about the failures and even near-malfeasance of payment processing systems. The paradoxical claims that crypto has no use case except fraud and crime, juxtaposed with the lamentation and gnashing of teeth over the misery of traditional payment systems is enough to provoke an existential examination of the senses. I honestly think it must be mostly sour grapes, since by far, cash and other traditional payment methods facilitate the vast, vast majority of crime and fraud, and cryptocurrency is the only universally accessible, trustless, (nearly) costless, instant, global system for the transfer of value between two parties. It is by far a better system, even with its flaws. Which is why, yes, many criminals use it, just as they use cash. Because it works. reply",

          "text": "Stablecoins on any number of low cost networks are fine for small payments (I haven’t lost anything, not even $0.01 in 10+years, vs tens of thousands in chargebacks, mostly fraudulent, for credit card processors). I factor in 2.5% total costs for transaction frictions, historically that is a bit over 3x our actual average cost from payer to bank account, but it would easily cover the occasional loss of a day or two of sales in a catastrophe. Pick a top 5 stablecoin that has a good reputation and at least 3 years, on a network with at least that, and  settle your accounts daily, or whenever the accumulation represents a significant dent if lost. The approximate aggregate risk-cost of major (top 10) stablecoins is somewhere south of .001% per day, and is better than the aggregate risk-cost of national fiat  currencies, which unremarkably collapse or suffer catastrophic inflation and rebasing on a regular basis. There are frequently several undergoing this process at any given time. reply",

          "text": "Idk, my experience is that it works fine. Even to the point that the cost of maintaining other payment systems was less cost effective than just dropping them and focusing on crypto only. FWIW we are not a “crypto” business, our focus is kinodynamics. Our market is global and we are small from a payment perspective in this context, so our case may be a bit of an outlier, but our lived experience does directly contradict your claim. I agree that speculation and crime is a problem, but the speculation market in global commerce and currency dwarfs crypto, así does the criminal usage of cash, so it’s disingenuously myopic to frame those as a crypto-centric issue. The relative difficulties of regulation because of the decentralized nature of crypto does make it a hotbed for schemes that wouldn’t be practical under local regulations, but I have a hard time getting riled up about that when we have giant state sponsored gambling industries nearly worldwide. If you were to compare the impact on criminal activity if you eliminated cash vs eliminating crypto, I think it’s easy to see that eliminating cash would be much more detrimental to criminal activity. In all, the arguments being made are not at all based on a rational examination of verifiable ground truths. They are almost to a fault emotionally based arguments with a near hysterical pitch woven into them from the start. It seems like some people fear crypto. I don’t know why, but they do. On some level, they fear the threat it poses to the devil they know, perhaps. Maybe that is why they react the way they do. reply",

Your friend may want to consider text macro tools such as Keyboard Maestro for macOS.

Create a list of frequently used words or segments, define a generic expansion key (in my case #) that doesn’t require a modifier.

This may be what you are referring to. I haven't tried it much but those layouts could be a temporary solution. I found Qwerty to be a lot easier to type one handed straight up because Dvorak tries to alternate hands between keys. I recently discovered Talon, an open source app for voice control of basically everything on a machine that requires no typing at all. I saw some people are using it even if they can use their hands, as a power tool. It appears to be fully Python scriptable and also gives you some nice speech to text abilities too. It allows you to specify a bunch of keywords for typing symbols and it looks like some people can do full coding quite quickly. Perhaps this injury could be an opportunity to try something like this and become more powerful than before? Best of luck and recovery to your friend. https://talonvoice.com/ reply",

But, I only needed it for a couple months. Like OP's relative, I also could not use my dominant arm, nor have my arm in a position that would allow typing one handed on a regular keyboard.  The twiddler was the only commercially available option that I was able to find that would allow me to type in this state.  So, another recommendation of twiddler, but with the caveat that the original had several warts, and while they appear to be redesigned, they may still suffer from some of them. The velcro strap to hold it to the hand, combined with the shape of the keyboard, allowed it to shift position while typing making it harder to use.  Photos of the current models show they have a different shape now.  Maybe this is less of a problem now?  They are also wireless now, so there isn't a wire constantly pulling it out of position whenever you move. The keyboard markings rubbed off completely after only a few weeks of use on my OG twiddler.  Hopefully they have worked that manufacturing issue out for the current models. reply",

Many people provide a rough spec, then either (shutter) vibe-code or edit substantially once it produces it. Having a RSI myself, I find that I can provide very detailed instructions in regular english, for which voice dictation works quite well to Cursor (but any others should work too), then it will produce code that I have to edit very little.  For most people this wouldn't be an efficient flow, but it greatly helps me reduce typing, thus is beneficial to me. With something like that, I believe you could do well pecking around with one hand for edits without needing to do much typing. On Mac, Karabiner-Elements is incredibly useful to remap things, such that you can enable things like mousekeys or otherwise that would keep from having to move (either) hand very much.  It's also a way to do as others have shown on this post and do a mirror layout or add something analogous to layers without having to buy new keyboards. reply",

          "text": "There is Edgar Matias's \"Half Keyboard\" layout, where the right hand's keys of a regular keyboard are mirrored on the left hand when holding a modifier key with your thumb.\nThe idea is that if you have learned touch-typing then muscle memory for the right hand should be available also on the left. Matias wrote an article [1] about it and then made it into a commercial product [2], but the concept should be possible on any programmable keyboard.\nPerhaps it would be possible with a AutoHotkey (MS-Windows) or Karabiner (MacOS) script otherwise. There is a large scene for more-or-less DIY \"ergonomic\" mechanical programmable keyboards with various different physical layouts, but common themes are 1) that they are split in a pair of two physical keyboards and 2) that they have multiple thumb-keys for modifiers / Return / Space. You could build and program just one half of such a pair.\nMany years ago I programmed an ErgoDox with the HalfKeyboard layout, just to try it out, and that ErgoDox I had built on a budget from mostly salvaged vintage components.

Surprisingly got used to type with two fingers and minimal movement though have to place the external keyboard at an awkward angle. My 2 cents would be to try out a few existing possibilities before investing heavily on alternates. Sometimes all such just-for-the-time-extensions (or should I call it contraptions?) do not have a useful after life after the utilization or in-need-of period. I have had many injuries / broken bones (or at least 7 more times! (And please don't judge me based on this. I'm either that clumsy or those were freak incidents...)) and none that were created / acquired to help me out during those restricted movement periods have stayed with me... Anyways, the mileage may vary... My short advice... Try for sometime (if you could get somethings loaned or borrowed) for a short / extended-short periods and invest... Tough times and best wishes and speedy recovery to get back on feet and to a healthy normal! This too shall pass... reply",

You can order something like a Keychron keyboard (they have many models that support VIA/QMK and full keyboard remapping) and implement the same layout, or something more \"natural\" like a mirror layout. reply",

          "text": "~25 years ago I injured my right (dominant) hand and wasn't able to type with it for about 2.5 months. I figured the time was short enough that I would just use a regular keyboard, one handed, and live with the slowdown. It was annoying, certainly, and while I did get faster typing only with my left hand, I of course never got close to full speed. But it was fine, I survived, and I don't think it would have been worth spending the money, as well as the time to learn a new keyboard setup. Remember that a one-handed keyboard (or some other arrangement) isn't going to bring you back up to full speed immediately. It's probably going to take a few weeks to learn, and you might not even get back up to full speed at all. reply",

Honestly, if you aren't used to one handed typing its not worth the time to train to get good at it(I'm assuming they're right hand dominant) its all just muscle memory. If they can pick it up quickly go for it, keyboard bindings, or something like predictive text assistance, or even vim-like remappings are an interesting idea. IMO - if possible just peck-type(like an old lady who is learning to use a keyboard) or use text to speech/AI & editing where possible - like in emails. They shouldn't be using the left arm/hand much right after surgery anyway. If they're programming definitely not as easy but still doable. reply",

          "text": "The best solution for me was to type with the left hand and switch from a mouse to a Logitech MX Ergo thumb-trackball — the key advantage is it can sit inside the sling and instantly give me full functionality. My use case was shoulder surgery that kept my dominant right hand in a sling for two+ months, but I could use my fingers after a week or so, and much of my work is CAD. It took only a few hours to completely get used to it, and I never went back to a mouse. While left-hand-only typing speed obviously went down, this was significantly mitigated by having a full function point-&-click device. It turns out this setup is also really helpful when working in tight spaces where a mouse is near-impossible, such as airplanes or tight luncheon booths. Even typing emails and multi-page documents left-handed was tolerable for 10 weeks, but if it had been longer, I probably would have looked into a chorded one-handed keyboard solution, as the learning cost would have been worth it. I hope this helps, and good on you for helping your friend, and I hope they get well fast! reply",

Here is the seminal Google Tech Talk about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpOxbesRNBc Here is a demo of using Dasher by an engineer at Google, Ada Majorek, who has ALS and uses Dasher and a Headmouse to program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ Another one of her demonstrating Dasher: Ada Majorek Introduction - CSUN Dasher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsSrClBwPM Here’s a more recent presentation about it, that tells all about the latest open source release of Dasher 5: Dasher - CSUN 2016 - Ada Majorek and Raquel Romano https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFlkM_e-sDg Here's the github repo: Dasher Version 4.11 https://github.com/GNOME/dasher >Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing high rates of text entry. Ada referred me to this mind bending prototype: D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 >( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) - a really neat way to \"dive\" through a menu hierarchy/, or through recursively nested options (to build words, letter by letter, swiftly). D@sher takes Dasher, and gives it a twist, making slightly better use of screen revenue. >It also \"learns\" your typical useage, making more frequently selected options larger than sibling options. This makes it faster to use, each time you use it. >More information here: http://beznesstime.blogspot.com and here: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=960 Dasher is even a viable way to input text in VR, just by pointing your head, without a special input device! Text Input with Oculus Rift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQgluUwV2U >As part of VR development environment I'm currently writing ( https://github.com/xanxys/construct ), I've implemented dasher ( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) to input text. One important property of Dasher is that you can pre-train it on a corpus of typical text, and dynamically train it while you use it. It learns the patterns of letters and words you use often, and those become bigger and bigger targets that string together so you can select them even more quickly! Ada Majorek has it configured to toggle between English and her native language so she can switch between writing email to her family abroad and co-workers at google. Now think of what you could do with a version of dasher integrated with a programmer's IDE, that knew the syntax of the programming language you're using, as well as the names of all the variables and functions in scope, plus how often they're used! I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins...

          "text": "You're proving exactly why I posted what I did. Nobody else has the time to watch a couple of 45 minute videos (several hours actually), so I took the time to do that myself (several more videos about Dasher than those, in fact), and summarize them for you. I've had email discussions about Dasher with people I mentioned like Ada Majorek (Google), also David Ward (Inference, who worked with the late David MacKay), Tom Doellstorff (UC Irvine), Donna Z. Davis (University of Oregon), and I've read several papers about it, and also the open source code on github, to understand how it works. So I took the time to summarize the points in the videos, the email discussions I've had, the papers I read, and source code I reviewed. https://www.inference.org.uk/djw30/ There are many interesting points and ideas I've tried to gather together and summarize, and I think Dasher is an important, underrated, not widely known piece of work, that can deeply improve many people's lives, which more people should know about. Not just people with a wide range of disabilities, but fully abled people without free time on their hands who frequently need to input lots of text quickly. That's why accessibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion are so important: they help everyone. Dasher a wonderful open source project to contribute to, and a solid foundation that needs to be brought up-to-date and re-implement it in terms of modern LLMs, AI assisted IDEs like Cursor, mobile, and VR/AR user interfaces. I don't have time to do all of that myself, but I hope to save other people time and effort by writing about it, and I hope to inspire students, researchers, software developers, hackers, and therapists who do have the time, interest, friends, loved ones, patients, and customers who could benefit from it. I'm sorry to hear about your disabilities of poor reading comprehension and trouble parsing text, and I'm envious that you have so much free time and nothing better to do, that you can take time to complain about your impatience with and intolerance of my writing. But it would have been easier, more efficient, and less stressful for you to simply ignore things you're not interested in rather than unconstructively whining with off-topic posts that benefit nobody. Obviously you don't appreciate how lucky you are to be able to type such a useless post so easily. I'm not even asking you to be empathic, or give a shit about anyone but yourself: if you're lucky enough to live long enough, you'll need accessibility tools like Dasher too. If you'd like to redeem yourself by writing a more useful constructive response to my post, then go right ahead, read my previous posts, watch all the videos, read all the papers and source code yourself, have some email discussions with other people using and working on Dasher, and then try to write a better summary, because your abstract summary above has absolutely no useful information, and isn't relevant to the discussion -- just a waste of your time and everyone else's. Or you could even take the trivial effort to paste my write-up into ChatGPT and post a summary, but that would be much lower quality and less enlightening than actually watching the videos and reading the articles and source code I cited yourself, but still better and more interesting than your current bitter off-topic \"contribution\" to the discussion. If it makes you feel better, I've written every word of this post personally just for you, MyPasswordSucks. No copying or pasting whatsoever (except the email at the end, with updated links to archive.org since my web site is offline, and I reformatted the transcript of Ada's video). Are you satisfied? Is that the attention you crave? Are my syntax and semantics comprehensible to you now? In return, what do you have to contribute to this discussion yourself, besides whining and criticizing form instead of substance? At least aaron695's rightfully flagged dead sibling comment unsuccessfully and incoherently attempted to criticize dasher itself, not just the messenger, so it was at least more on topic than you post. I hope you can do better. Here's the email I sent and the response that Ada Majorek wrote to me, using Dasher and headmouse. Since she was so swamped with work at Google, and it took her so much time and effort, even with Dasher, for her to reply to my email because she has ALS, I cherish her helpful reply, and I am glad you reminded me to share it, even if it annoys you to read so much thoughtful meticulously written text that she took the precious time out of her challenging life to write to me: ---- Hello! I’ve been a huge fan of Dasher for years! I'm sad to hear that David MacKay passed away. I knew of his work on Dasher, but am just discovering his great work on global warming. I’m happy to discover how Ada Majorek is carrying on his work, and that Dasher version 5 has been released! I developed and evaluated pie menus in the late 80’s and have used them in various games and applications, and more recently I’ve been doing mobile and VR programming with Unity3D. I’m interested in helping develop versions of Dasher on other platforms, especially Unity, and specifically for head mounted displays. Is anyone else working on that, with whom I could collaborate? I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins... I’d be delighted to discuss Dasher and aQuery with anyone who’s interested! Here’s some discussion on hacker news, to which I contributed some comments about Dasher: A History of Palm, Part 1: Before the PalmPilot (lowendmac.com) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12306377 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12310029 -Don ---- Hi Don, I will write more soon. I was swamped with work last week. First, I am very happy to see your interest in Dasher.\nI don't have enough time to research another platform. I will be happy to give you walk through the code, and you can decide, if adding Unity is feasible. Is it possible to interface with C++ code on Uniy? There is Dasher Core. It is platform independent. And \"all\" you need to do is to extend several classes. Implementing it in Java Script is an interesting idea. You are second person suggesting it. Again, I will not have time to do it. But would gladly answer any questions. When you wrote about radial menus, I immediately thought of this prototype. Have you seen it before? D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 I better send half of the email now, than full email never ;-) Written with Dasher and Headmouse. :-) Ada ---- Thank you for your quick reply — I’m delighted to hear from you! Yes, it’s possible to interface native C++ code with Unity. It would also be possible to translate the C++ code to C#, which is a similar language (just cleaner and more modern). It’s also possible to compile C++ into JavaScript, but that makes it considerably harder to integrate with normal JavaScript code, so it might also be worth considering translating the C++ code to JavaScript by hand, to make it more efficient and better integrated with the browser. That adaptive hierarchical radial menu is wonderful! Thank you for linking me to that. I’ll contact the author and brainstorm ideas! That reminds me of a weird experiment I tried years ago: Here is a “precision pie menu” that I made for the NeWS window system, which lets you precisely select an angle by poking out of the circle and precisely dialing in an exact number with a flexible floppy line. I’ve never used it for anything practical, but it was a fun experiment! Precision Pie Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0scs59va4c Experiments like that are useful vehicles for exploring possibilities and generating new ideas, even if they aren’t directly useful themselves. You just can’t get very far by doing though experiments alone — you need to play with a working prototype and actually feel how it works, in order to decide how to improve it or design something different. It’s so cool you’re using Dasher and a Headmouse for everyday work, and that gives you so much experience and insight into how to use it best and make it better. So please don’t hesitate to send me half emails and half baked ideas, even if you don’t have the time to finish them! -Don ---- Ada Majorek on Dasher: [I reformatted her inspiring transcript, for people who don't have time to watch the three minute video, although it's well worth it to see how Dasher works.] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ ALS robbed me from ability to speak and ability to use computer keyboard. Thanks to Dasher I am still able to communicate at reasonable speed. Hi, my name is Ada. I want to talk about why I like Dasher. Since my ALS diagnosis in 2013 I tried countless number of alternative text entry and speech generation methods. So far Dasher is the fastest and least tiring. Dasher supports multiple languages. Very important for me, since I switch between English and Polish many times per day. I really like geeky origin of Dasher. It started as a visualization of arithmetic coding algorithm. Unfortunately at the time Dasher was not actively maintained. I was a software engineer in desperate need for a fast alternative communication tool. Dasher was an open-source project. I decided to start coding. With help of my friends and support of Google, we added many features making Dasher even better suited for alternative means of communication. And here we are today after almost 6 years of silence we are releasing a new version of Dasher: Dasher 5.00. If you know people with motor impairments or therapists, please let them know. They will like new features we have added. If you know programming, consider contributing to this very valuable project. And last but not least, if you worked on Dasher in the past, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. reply",

Trump mocks reporter with disability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX9reO3QnUA >Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for mocking a New York Times reporter that suffers from a chronic condition.  CNN's John Berman reports Here's a low-effort ChatGPT generated TL;DR summary, to satisfy MyPasswordSucks who had trouble reading my other post: Here’s the straight-up rundown of the Dasher thread: DonHopkins jumped in to rave about Dasher—calling it a miracle for people who can’t type. He dropped links to videos, papers, GitHub, and even shared his personal emails with Ada Majorek, who uses Dasher because ALS stole her voice and hands. He made it clear he’d dug deep—watched hours of videos, pored over source code, talked to experts. He went all in to explain why Dasher deserves more love: it’s based on solid info theory, it learns your patterns, it’s openly extensible, and it works across languages and platforms—even VR. Someone named novosel chimed in asking why Don’s comment was downvoted, saying Dasher really is worth knowing. But then MyPasswordSucks blasted it as “barely-parsable copy-paste diarrhea” and declared Dasher awful, claiming the whole thing was off-topic. He sneered at Don’s effort, calling it useless. aaron695 piled on, arguing Dasher isn’t the answer for someone with a short-term injury and criticizing Don’s wall of text even more harshly. DonHopkins didn’t back down. He defended his post, pointed out how much final work he put in—no copying or pasting. He reminded people Ada had replied personally, highlighting how essential Dasher is for her. He got indignant about people whining instead of appreciating the depth of his write-up. In short, DonHopkins delivered a massive, heartfelt case for Dasher. Critics flamed him for style and focus. The result: a messy, heated debate between someone who’s poured years into accessibility work and anonymous commenters who can’t be bothered to look beyond a giant block of text. reply",

          "text": "New Hedge fund | Sr/Staff Frontend Engineer | On-site (NYC) We are a new discretionary, tech industry focused hedge fund, founded by a portfolio manager with 15+ years of experience at a Tiger Cub. I lead the data/technology team here and previously spent ~6 years in a similar role at a well known Tiger Cub. We are hiring for a frontend senior/staff engineer for our internal research management web application. Our tech stack: * Frontend: Typescript, Vue3 * Backend: Cloudflare, Supabase/Postgresql, Typescript * Obviously, we are not the only ones trying to figure out how to use AI in investing but in a world where there are lots of people trying to build picks & shovels, this is an opportunity to be one of the goldminers at a greenfield, new firm. This role makes sense for people who are interested in finance/investing (although you do not necessarily have to have experience in the industry). We're in full-time in office in NYC, so that's a requirement for FTE. We are potentially open to exceptional contractors located remotely. We work very hard, hours are long, and people are very dedicated to the mission. It is not for everyone, but for those interested in competing in financial markets, love startup atmosphere without near-term existential risk, and want to work with super smart colleagues (both technical and investors!), this could be a great fit. Target salary 180-250K, depending on experience + Bonus/Carry (hedge fund equity equivalent) Contact: ai@nx1.com , I'm Alex. reply",

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users.

We have two of the largest self hosted ClickHouse clusters out there (and growing rapidly) each with Petabytes of data. We are working on really interesting solutions to problems that we would love to open source for the broader CH ecosystem: - Declarative, cluster aware migrations - Iceberg and S3 backed merge tree's on ClickHouse (as performant as local MergeTrees) - ClickHouse on K8s, but on Metal instances w/ NVMe used for caching and compaction. - Load shedding query scheduler and eventually query optimizer We have a broad charter when it comes to ClickHouse. It's one of the things that enables us to build so many products that share the same underlying data and context. Our goal is to enable all developers at PostHog to continue building these products quickly as the team and user-base scales. It's honestly an exciting time to be working at this company and on the beating heart of what drives it. Chat with me if you have any questions! reply",

From budgeting tools that prevent overspending to AI-driven insights that surface patterns in your spending, Klutch lets users shape how their credit card works for them. Our core belief: financial products should be programmable, transparent, and intelligent. We're looking for builders to help shape this vision: Fullstack Developer – Kotlin + React. You'll ship end-to-end features, build new mini-apps, and contribute to the internal platform that powers them. Product Designer – Help define a UX model for composable finance—where users can mix and match tools that feel tailored to them. Product Manager – Own a domain like AI Insights or Budget Controls. You'll define the roadmap, talk to users, and launch products quickly. We use Kotlin (Exposed, Ktor), React + Next.js, AWS (Fargate, Lambda), MySQL, and Mongo. Our stack also supports integrating AI models directly into mini-apps.

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems. Pleas remember that we are looking for NYC local only, no exceptions at this time :(.

          "text": "Do this course https://github.com/henki-robotics/robotics_essentials_ros2 Totally free, don't need to buy anything just a computer. I've been designing electrical hardware for robots for the last 4 years for a big corporation and I can tell you, the fun and money is in the software but having another skill is awesome. Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow. Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project. If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper. As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank. Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are. And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective. reply",

          "text": "I'm in the field and I disagree with the initial direction of this post. You aren't going to 'learn robotics' in a meaningful manner by checking the boxes in a online ROS2 course. Robotics is a compound discipline which pairs mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge with mathematics and software development. In order to get meaningful practice in all of these areas, I would recommend re-implementing a robot vacuum from 'scratch'. The actual vacuum part is non-essential, as you're really trying to implement the famous 'turtle' robot and experience all the design steps/compromises/challenges first hand. As a goal, aim for autonomous navigation around your home that works equivalently to a cheap 'throwaway' robo-vac. Keep in mind you are surrounded by robotics. Most passenger vehicles, consumer drones, micro-mobility devices and modern construction equipment are 'robots in varying degrees of disguise'. Practical knowledge regarding any of these systems transfers well if you know where to apply it. reply",

My degree was in computer engineering and didn't cover any PLC, but I contract and PLC comes up a lot in one-off things that need to be reliable. reply",

          "text": "Yeah. As some has said already PLC are more oriented to robotic arms in factories etc, where space is not a premium.  Robots like anymal from anybotics, spot from boston dynamics or the unidog from unitree to name a few don't use PLC at all due to lack of space. Also energy efficiency, mcu at most will push less than a watt to move something complex, a motor control for the FOC, I mentioned earlier. I worked for the past 4 years in HP siteprint.The main problem was developing all to fit inside a pelican case that you could check in on a plane. The smallest PLC was almost the full internal volume of the robot. That's why I said microcontrollers, more ready available to experiment at home, faaaaaaaar more cheaper and those two, very well documented. STM32 in europe is the big player but is harder to get into, the documentation tends to be cahotic. reply",

          "text": "This is by far one of the best ways to learn IMO https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_a... The idea of that game is that you build vehicles to do rescues and deal with natural disasters. While there is a career mode where you gain currency that you can spend on parts and fuel, most people who play that game play it in sandbox mode where you essentially design vehicles to do certain things, while also configuring the game to chose missions it generates. For example, you can make it so you only have to deal with land rescue missions or only fight enemy ai. The building system is VERY in depth.  While you don't have to worry about structural strength, you do have to keep things in mind like part placement, CG location, internal volume for buoyancy for ships. Then you get to propulsion, which you have to build out of components - the game has a fairly indepth internal combustion engine simulator where you build custom engines, and have to make sure they are fed with adequate fuel, air, and cooled appropriately. You can do jet engines, you can do nuclear, you can do full electric, and so on. Then you have to build systems to do missions - for example, to transport a container you have to build a crane to be able to pick it up. Finally, the game features a microcontroller system which is the bread and butter of doing cool things. There is a bunch of sensors that can read data (GPS, laser distance, pitch, roll, heading, radar, e.t.c), which you can route into a microcontroller, and do math either with logic blocks or Lua code, and thats how you build automation. You will get very familiar with things like PID controller tuning, trigonometry math (for things like distance sensing), state machine coding practices, and other things that are all applicable to the real world. reply",

          "text": "Two bits of advice: just jump in, and set reasonable expectations for yourself. Robotics is a field filled with layers upon layers of complexity, theory, and real-world problems. Those at the top of the game (think robust dog robots, walking bipedal star wars droids, high-speed and high-torque many-DOF arm platforms) are leveraging learnings and expensive prototypes from decades of work/research to achieve those feats. This is not to be discouraging, but to say - they all started somewhere - you too can start, and maybe you won't build things like that today, but you can get there. And the cool thing is all that robotics work by experts has made the barrier to entry much lower - today you can choose to apply money to solve problems you don't want to learn and focus on the things you do want to learn, in ways that weren't possible 10 years ago. Need a powerful closed loop motor system? Buy an ODrive or closed-loop stepper platform off the shelf, and focus on how to apply those systems to build something higher level. But the big difference with learning hardware/robotics compared to software (speaking from experience having watched a lot of really smart people struggle to get robots working when I ran an MIT robotics competition, 6.270, and was a lab assistant for another course, 6.141) is that the real world is unforgiving in a way that software is generally not. So if you come from a software background, you will find that robotics can have so many more setbacks because nothing ever moves/behaves/reacts in a precisely predictable way in physical space. This is why I say just jump in - you'll have fun learning all the ways things go wrong, and they faster you get that learning out of the way, the sooner you can build things that work reliably! Try things and figure out how and why they don't work, and iterate. But don't set unrealistically high expectations or it will just be frustrating. reply",

The task is different each year, with sub-tasks of varying levels of difficulty, so teams with widely different skill levels can take part: some robots are very simple while others are amazingly complicated. It's a great way for high schoolers to learn engineering skills, anything from programming to mechanical engineering.) reply",

          "text": "I couldn't agree more. FIRST is an excellent organization to get involved with. Even if you don't have specialities which directly align with the needs of a team, most will not turn you away (especially if you demonstrate passion). Just a few thoughts about starting a team and/or volunteering: Starting a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team is not for the feint-of-heart and requires significant time and money investment. This is the sort of endeavor you try when you're either retired or have a group of other dedicated volunteers willing to help you build the team over multiple seasons. If you spend a year or two mentoring/volunteering for a well-established team, you'll get a good sense of what you're getting into. FRC is a bit hardcore. If no FRC teams exist nearby, FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a good entrypoint, but may not be technical enough for an adult interested in using FIRST to gain exposure to robotics. (It is plenty satisfying to mentor these teams, but Mindstorms can be somewhat limiting.) These are geared toward using Lego Mindstorms for learning robot concepts. A good middle ground (for exposure to more practical robotics) would be volunteering with a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. It's the middle ground between FLL and FRC and is _doable_ for a single, dedicated, passionate adult to start (though I'd strongly recommend finding another volunteer to pursue this with). If getting involved with a team is not an option, seek out nearby FIRST events that you can volunteer at. Many competition events need volunteers and you'll get a chance to interact with local teams and find plenty of opportunities to play with robots. reply",

I'm not entirely sure how to make that more 'accessible'. It's like, spend the next 5 years of your life mastering difficult math and electronics so that the sensors can be integrated into feedback that stabilizes a motor system. I guess you can cheat and use servos for a lot of this (where an EE already solved many feedback loop issues). But if you ever need to build your own sensor+motor solution you'd get stuck if you didn't know the math. ------- Making simple controls without relying upon feedback sensors is likely the goal, you can do a lot with that. But then do your best to avoid the Masters level demons that plague this problem set. Maybe learn PID controller theory and if that isn't enough for your problems, give up and try a different design. PID is simple enough that you won't need years of math to learn, but it's very adhoc to configure and not always the best methodology to use. Better than nothing though. reply",

Grad schools prepare you for the basics of the hardest possible systems. On the engineering side the number of difficult problems with robotics is enormous. Even the simplest systems will fail pretty badly outside lab. No two robots will work the same. As a grad student those are the things you learn on top of IK at work. So if you get employed for designing actual 6+ DoF systems and missing the theoretical stuff you'll be way behind. However, for self teaching and hobby stuff, just making a simple robot work reliably is still a difficult task with lots of learning potential. It may not cover complex arms but you may actually gain knowledge to solve the engineering part of the problems which is a huge boost for theories. reply",

          "text": "A really top-tier robotics engineer is going to be a generalist across mechanical, electrical, and several software domains, and then also a specialist, deep expert in one or two of those. So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours. I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons. reply",

Crunch labs: https://www.crunchlabs.com/ As someone in the industry (I literally can call myself a Robot Master having a Masters Degree in Robotics), these simple “kid kits” are phenomenal. When you first start out, the hardest part is knowing the hardware is actually going to do what you tell it to do. Simplifying the mechanical engineering/electrical engineering so you can immediately create real world actions makes a huge difference in giving you motivation to keep going. Once you have the basics in place and you understand mechanisms, sensors, and some algorithms, you can move on to other parts of robotics. However, keep in mind robotics is really about system thinking… you have to understand trades between sensing, thinking, and acting. But most importantly you have to remember you are dealing with the real world… you can’t as easily write a unit test and know that a particular actuator will behave exactly the same way every time. reply",

          "text": "There are many ways to start with a more academic knowledge of robotics. Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care. It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch. This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot. As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more \"formal\" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist. My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT! For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for <$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive. For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all. For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running. As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach. reply",

If you are interested in getting this One Amazing Thing working, great!  You have the motivation and cranking through what you'll need to lean to succeed will be possible. IF, on the other hand, you want to make 1e6 of these things (\"tech giants seems to capture most of the conversation\")-- that a completely different story.  You're going to need a skilled team, ideally one that has been to a rodeo before.    I can't help you there. But if you're building one, for fun --- Just DO It.  Ask friendly robotics club members when you get stuck.  IF your problem is particularly and singularly unique, then whatever domain that entails, you will need to master; that's your Secret Sauce. Ivan Sutherland, who was Thesis Advisor to CMU's first Robotics Institute PhD said something to the effect that after 4 years of a Robotics PhD program, you end up with the ability to solder and attach connectors with a high degree of confidence. A True Roboticists requires deep knowledge in mathematics, software engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing small lots, reliability engineering, materials engineering, data collection & graphical evaluation methodologies..... What one might call a Systems Engineer's handbag.  It also helps to be inspired by the wonders of nature that biology affords us. The details?   eh, they change.  Whether you used some hot cpu, some hot language, some hot OS --- Marc Raibert's hopping & jumping robots used C and BSD4.3 Unix, with the kernel locks cleaned up (reduced) so a 1 kHz kernel interrupt stream could be supported on a 1 MIPS machine (Vax 780).  Timesharing was never stopped, but the kernel did get quite a large percentage of CPU cycles. I'll repeat: Just do it.  Start.  Move forward.  The project will teach you the questions you must ask. reply",

Turns out an advanced grad-student software group had brought me in (back in 2004) because their grad students couldn't build reliable software for the real world, and their military \"research partners\" were getting rather p.o.'d. \nBut I'm a non-degreed Mechatronics Systems Engineer, in the truest sense of the word. I'm old enough to predate software engineering programs. \nI learned robotics and automation because I was curious, it fueled my ADD, and I kept at it... in the beginning I used plug-in cards for the IBM PC, but I knew basic electronics as a hobby (ham radio, telephonics, heathkit, etc.) and I devoured books. Anything I could get my hands on. Especially Byte magazine and Steve Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar columns.\nSo get copies of Forest Mims III stuff, and get an arduino or raspberry pi (you can even get/run Codesys on a pi, to learn PLC stuff) and get magazine issues/books from Make: and watch lots of youtube from ElectroBoom and AvE and get your hands dirty. \nRemember, you can be skilled at robotics without building Optimus. Currently I'm building and programming high speed mail handling equipment. Not sexy, but it pays the bills and fuels my dopamine. It's all servomotors and sensors and decision logic. And challenging too, paper's moving at 1/8\" per millisecond at mid-speeds, you need to be an efficient coder and pre-optimizing your logic, and it's all state machines, all the way down. \nGood luck.

Rely too much on awareness and you will miss some safety issue during a complicated repair. You need good habits, but rely too much on them and you won't notice when you finally make a mistake. Those apply during repair processes. It's also possible to render a device unsafe to use, for example by damaging a li-ion battery or by a 'bodge' repair that circumvents a safety feature. reply",

          "text": "YouTube videos are great -if- the problem you're having is exactly the same as the problem the YouTuber is solving. For example, I was able to replace the HDMI capacitors on my A/V receiver because I lucked upon a YT video where the problem I was having was identical to the problem the YouTuber was solving. So it was basically, buy these capacitors, replace them, and off you go. Repair usually just requires basic soldering skills and the ability to put things back together you took apart. When the problem is not exactly the same, I'm just lost. There is not a lot of diagnosis videos on YouTube. All the videos are: \"1. I observed this problem. 2. [???] 3. I'll walk you through soldering on the new components.\" skipping the most important step 2. Same for car repair videos: \"I see Problem X happening. Problem X usually means component Y has failed. Here's how to replace component Y. The end.\" If that doesn't work, you wasted money on the part and your time ripping apart your car and putting it back together. reply",

          "text": "I repair practically anything that breaks in my house -- except heavy work on the car, or the roof. A few things, from me as a kid: 1. Take things apart, and try to figure out how they work. Don't worry too much about getting them back together. But then, trying to reassemble it is good practice too. There's plenty of old electronic junk that you can explore before throwing it away. Build a mental catalog of how things work and are assembled. Among other things, this will help you when you need to come up with a strategy for getting some particular gadget open -- often 9/10 of the problem. 2. Like others have said, YouTube is great. People will make a video of a repair, or even just getting something open, for a few \"likes.\" Also, most of them are just normal genuine people who aren't trying to be influencers, so it's kind of culturally refreshing. Many of my successful repairs started with YouTube, such as my clothes washer and dryer, refrigerator, lawn mower. 3. Many of my most cherished tools are what I call for \"demolition,\" not electronics specific, like picks, pry bars, a slim knife that can get between things, stuff like that. Another set of cherished tools are my magnifying visor, small magnifying glass, bright flashlight, and a stereo inspection microscope that I got second-hand. 4. A lot of \"electronic\" failures are actually mechanical in nature, and you can just use your general troubleshooting rundown to figure them out. Switches, connectors, cables, etc. 5. Begin to get the hang of identifying parts, and how part numbering schemes work. It will help you in your search for spares. 6. These days I often ask my spouse for a opinion. She's a laboratory scientist, quite sharp and skeptical. I'll have a hypothesis, and she asks the one question that blows it out of the water. Good luck! Don't get electrocuted or burn your house down. reply",

          "text": "I've got a friend who has been at this since learning in TV repair shops in the 1950s. His emphasis is always on fast turn-around. He doesn't believe in slowly turning on things with old electrolytic capacitors, for example. I've learned quite a bit from him. I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts. (Only use 1 hand, keep the other behind you, always have a safety partner, etc) I've learned to hate Silver Mica capacitors. I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder. I'd suggest starting with something like an Arduino starter kit to get a sense of how components actually interact. But remember, if something is dead, you can't really make it worse.

          "text": "The thing is that one needs understanding of an electrical engineer to debug circuits one wants to repair. When you have understanding you can do some voltage measurements and try to identify faulty part. There is gazillion different parts now, that wasn’t the case 2 decades ago. I know few people who repaired their washing machines just watching youtube videos. No skills and no knowledge. That’s the best error you can find - series error. All the appliances of the same manufacturer built in the 5 years will predictably fail and replacing 20 cent regulator revives the machine. There are then random faults, that need deep knowledge and hours of debugging. They’re not economically viable to repair unless the machinery is very expensive. Good example is 400€ transistor replacement in €20k Tektronix probe. Then there are things one shouldn’t touch - Tesla battery packs and open microwave ovens for example. Enough energy to kill or badly injure the unlucky hobbyists (in German): https://www.kosmo.at/tesla-akku-explodiert-mann-schwer-verle... There are enough analog electronics to repair what requires deep analog design knowledge. Music instruments and radio equipment might fall into this category. I would say, the repairs make no sense in the future that comes. With more and more electronics and programmable components the repairs are not economically viable. I am designing a motherboard with MPM54304 PMIC and a microprocessor. Both are programmed and without firmware sources and circuit diagram one will not able to recreate desired functionality. After product release I will organize workshop for my colleagues from service department and they will still come to me to discuss the repairs when some early faulty products will be send back by customers. reply",

          "text": "Washers and dryers are probably one of the best places to start - if you have the ability to bring them home, you can find them laying literally for free. 80% of the problems are a single part or loose connector, and they’re big enough and common enough that they’re easy to work on and have lots of YouTube help available. Then you can progress to working on the control boards themselves instead of just swapping them. If you have a garage and will do this, I highly recommend the harbor freight lift table: https://www.harborfreight.com/500-lb-capacity-hydraulic-tabl... Once you get into it you can actually make some coin, free washer, $10-50 in parts, sell for $100 when working. reply",

          "text": "I have Horowitz & Hill, and they (two volumes now) are probably overkill for hobby repair. There's a large-format book called \"Practical Electronics for Inventors\" by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk which is a good intro to the physical side of electronics. For troubleshooting power audio electronics Rod Elliott (sound-au.com) has a large number of useful articles both on simple theory (no poles and zeros) and on practical matters. Bob Cordell's and/or Doug Self's books on designing power amplifiers are good for a bit more \"practical theory\" (how the blocks are arranged, what goes wrong with poor design and/or a too-small budget for protection). I don't have recommendations for radio frequency because I've not spent time with it. The ARRL (Amateur Radio Relay League) has several books that are well regarded, I believe. reply",

Then, all you need is a broken gadget. If you search for the symptoms, and the name / brand of the gadget, you'll find the most likely causes. Open it up and check for the simplest / most probable cause, and work through them. My most recent fix was on a washing machine. After ruling out the simpler issues .. it turned out to be dry solder on the main relay on a rather hairy looking control board. Before this the drain pump had died .. it was amazing technology shipped home by someone on ebay for $20! reply",

Start with simple thing: A heater, a drill, etc. You won't learn much if you take apart complex gadget like smartphone.

For repairing equipment, you dont need high-end equipment from fluke or keysight. a cheap $20 DMM and $30 soldering iron will get you really far.

          "text": "\"common failure mode\" = 'they break in a particular way a lot' As Randy Fromm says, \"the things that work the hardest fail the most\" Examples: MLCC (multi-layer ceramic capacitors) over time will often fail short. Older devices with electrolytic capacitors (the large can-shaped things often situated by where the power input is) have a liquid electrolyte in them that evaporates (boils off?) over time. When it does, they lose their capacitance and the power supply stops being able to supply (good) power. The point being, when something stops working, check these things first. It's like if your lawnmower dies on you, don't go pulling off the head to look at the piston. Check if there's gas in the tank first. Finally, a DMM is a digital multimeter. This is your basic tool to measure voltage, current resistance, capacitance, et c.) You can't do much troubleshooting without one. Hope this helps. reply",

Thats pretty much it for the low level. Find a book that covers this stuff and avoid maxwell and the physics approach unless at some point you want to suffer / get really deep. Also, flux. Lots of flux and alcohol to clean it up. Flux is the key to good solder joints, that and getting comfortable creating jigs. Whatever you're soldering has to remain still while the solder sets.

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

          "text": ">I'd wager learning the basics Very good bet. You still have to beat the odds a lot of times beyond that, since some things are just plain fubar and can't be fixed :\\ Others which can just barely be fixed often rely on equal parts luck and skill, I'm the first to admit. I like the idea of learning how to build for a bit, before migrating more seriously toward teardown & repair. A really good start is to build a few simple hobbyist kits that run on 9 volt batteries. You may just get blinking LED's or a buzzing speaker but everything is in the kit and you get the experience with individual components. You can gain a lot that way without even trying to understand theory, but one of the best ways to develop understanding is to go back to a project you have built from the ground up, and then research each of the elements that you have already been successfully working with until you reach full understanding or at least a satisfactory plateau at that point.  Simple discrete components are probably best to develop great confidence with, before trying to deeply study the internals of integrated circuit \"chips\".  It can also be a lot more meaningful when it's your own project you are learning basic theory about, or even the most advanced equations.  If you concentrate on a limited area, it sure is more within reach than learning everything you need for a degree. The main \"academic\" thing that you can not skip is constantly learning how to better read & draw schematics. You will definitely be more quickly able to \"turn something that doesn't work\" (never even was working!) into something that works if your success rate is nominal. Every project like this is helpful as long as you are continuing to learn, Once you have built a simple kit you may later want to revisit the device and construct a \"duplicate\" from entirely recycled components that you must first remove from scrap circuit boards.  If you do the math these can be some of the most affordable components :)  Also flexes your un -soldering ability.  All without electronic theory, but it's there for the asking any time you want to dig deeper. You will use all that experience to better repair things when they need it, especially the simpler problems which may not be the most abundant but it's nice to have them under control.  Gaining more intuition about electron flow in general through experience will be more rewarding through time. While escalating your abilities when your ambition moves beyond 9 volts. More care than needed will get you a lot further than less care. reply",

If one just knows, for example, that very many faults are power supply related, and knows that problems with capacitors and transistors are responsible for a lot of power supply problems, you can accomplish quite a bit. But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult. But even then, if we watch some of what the different folks on Youtube accomplish repairing smartphones, laptops, etc., we'll see that some of these guys can achieve some pretty impressive results even without fancy labs and complete schematics, etc. Not everything is repairable of course, but I don't think pursuing this path is exactly \"tilting at windmills\" either. reply",

          "text": "I've done a lot of tinkering and repair of home electronics and appliances and usually the problem is a blown fuse, bad connector, bad switch, worn out battery, or other simple problems. Stocking these items - connectors, switches, fuses, rechargeable batteries - will let you fix the most common problems. A lot of folks have given good advice on resources to learn about electronics and ways to practice, so I wanted to offer a little practical advice about tools and supplies that I've picked up over the years. Most important equipment is a multimeter and soldering station (with desoldering supplies), good wire cutters and strippers (I like the self-adjusting wire strippers for everything except very large and very small gauge wire), so I'll recommend a couple of additional tips I've learned; first, don't get an auto-ranging multimeter, especially cheap ones are usually not very good. I would also recommend one with a higher \"count\" like 6000 count, meaning the voltage and resistance measurements ranges go up to 6, meaning you have more range before you have to switch to the next higher range. Also, I want to really emphasize the importance of good soldering materials and technique - I prefer finer solder because it melts faster and requires less heat. It is easy to destroy some more sensitive items with too much heat. Learn to recognize a cold joint, make sure to use a good flux (I like liquid flux like kester 186). Keep a wet sponge at your station for cleaning the tip, remember to tin the tip, and use a fume extractor. Also, there are a variety of \"third hands\" you can get, I don't really like the small ones with two alligator clips and a magnifying glass, you can get ones with more clips that can hold more things, but a magnifying glass is really helpful (although it interferes with your depth perception) - I use a gooseneck magnifying glass with a built in light ring to help me solder. Make sure you have heat shrink tubing and a heat gun. These are great for finishing wires and much more durable than wrapping with electrical tape (although high quality electrical tape like super 33 is much better than the cheap stuff) Finally, when you're looking at a board, try to identify how the electricity will flow. Learn to identify the ground and vcc traces/planes on a pcb and test your theories with the multimeter (continuity mode on a powered off device is best for this). Build up a mental model of how the device works, and write down a circuit diagram. Seek to learn to identify common circuit patterns and what they are used for - decoupling caps, pull-up/pull-down resistors, ESD protection diodes, debouncing filters, level shifters, voltage dividers, op-amp configurations, serial headers (SPI, UART, JTAG, etc), transistor/mosfet/h-bridges. Learn to identify your ICs and look up the datasheets (I have found that taking a picture with flash with my phone is the best way to read hard-to-read IC labels) - the app notes will usually have a reference circuit with the necessary components, and you can use those to identify which components are related and why they're there. Good luck and have fun! reply",

          "text": "> I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. If you foresee supply chain or financial difficulties where you are, enough that people will need to keep old machines running... * Question: Are you thinking for keeping your family's device's working, and maybe teaching them?  Or for operating a primary business, or side business? * If you're currently financially comfortable, you might want to quickly learn what tools and supplies you'll need for several(?) years, and see whether they're currently available and inexpensive where you are.  (For example, temperature-controlled soldering irons, desoldering device or braid, a multimeter that has all the features you expect to need, misc. screwdrivers, many sizes and types of security bits, smartphone repair spudgers and suction cups, an assortment of various high-quality capacitors of various specs, an assortment of hookup wire, fuses.  Some common parts, like mains power cords, are easy to find from unfixable devices.) * Repairing power tools and small&large appliances, is a bit different than repairing old radios and televisions, is a bit different than new radios and televisions, is a bit different than older computers, is a bit different than newer computers. * If this includes keeping old computers working, you might want to think about what kinds, and what parts will wear out and be difficult to cannibalize.  For example, some laptop models will need their fans replaced eventually, and then maybe their keyboards.  Laptops made 15(?) years ago will soon need new backlight tubes and/or inverter boards, or new panels (possibly LED-backlit, plus the electronics to drive them).  Most PCs and laptops will need new thermal compound eventually, especially if you do some kinds of work on them.  Fortunately, most PC parts can be cannibalized easily. * Repairing smartphones requires special parts and supplies, and in some cases might be impossible.  You might think ahead to which ones you expect to want to repair, watch (and try to youtube-dl) the tutorial videos, and * For a business refurbishing old laptops, you might want to start saving repair PDFs now, in case the Internet gets fragmented.  For Lenovo/IBM ThinkPad laptops, search for \"Hardware Maintenance Manual\" and the model numbers. * Try to avoid IoT, and computers and software that depend on some company's servers to keep running.  And move to Linux (such as Debian Stable) if you haven't already.  WiFi routers should be running OpenWrt for security and longevity.  And consider whether you want to focus on a particular ecosystem of smartphone and tablet (iOS, proprietary Android, \"alternative firmware\" Android) that you expect to be able to source enough devices for and keep working. reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I started by developing MCU-based edge systems and their Unix-based servers.  My current work involves creation of custom Linux distributions for a variety of embedded systems, including board design, bring up, and new driver development. I have been involved with handheld IoT and backend devops longer than those reductive abbreviations have existed.  I have been committed to using open source tools and platforms for the past twenty five years, and I have worked directly to improve that ecosystem (e.g. GNU toolchain, OpenOCD, OpenEmbedded). I strongly prefer to produce open source solutions as well, but I have learned to be practical when it comes to building a business. I am looking for a fully remote position at the staff through founder level, helping to architect and build a new embedded platform in an interesting vertical.  I am interested in working with robotics, drones, 3-D printing, or other kinds of motorized and articulated systems. Technologies and markets that I will actively avoid include JavaScript/Java/PHP/Ruby, Microsoft products/platforms, off-site clouds, Anything-as-a-Service, fintech/cryptocurrencies, \"web3\", large/multinational businesses, government agencies, and similar engineering. reply",

I am Donovan Preston. I first became heavily involved with programming and open source software through the Twisted Python project. I then went on to work on the bulk of the early code for eventlet. Python asyncio is now a part of the standard library, and I like to think that these projects influenced the direction of async programming in Python. Later, I worked for Mozilla Research and then the Mozilla Services organizations. I helped with a project called dom.js (which now lives on as domino), implemented TCP and UDP apis for Firefox OS, worked on several experiments such as Firefox Screenshots (main developer at the beginning of the project) and Firefox Send (on the Android port). Finally, I worked on the port of the Firefox Sync server from Python to Rust. I gained extensive experience with ES.Next, React, TypeScript, and Rust. Now, I have a small consultancy and have worked on several Swift apps, in addition to HTML/CSS and full stack web applications. I am looking to work on a team again and in-person is preferrable, although remote is ok. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual.

          "text": "I started as a dev shop and built 2 API products based on user demand. 1 is an OCR and document extraction service [0]. We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage.

And it's not too uncommon for former employers to be one of their first clients or get your first clients from relationships associated with your former employer. All of this assumes you don't burn bridges and have the interpersonal skills, in-demand expertise, luck, timing, and interest in building out a small service-based business. reply",

I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo. What I wish I knew: don't use RapidAPI. They charge 20%, they have a terrible interface, and they let customers run up huge charges and walk away without paying anything.

Uber and Lyft make big money, not their drivers. Amazon and Ebay make big money, not their sellers. McDonalds makes more money than their food suppliers, and franchisees. The exception is with something like intellectual property, let's use movies as an example. The owners of the content want to sell it widely and will do a variety of distribution deals for different distribution channels. However, if any distribution channel starts taking a big slice of the money pie, the terms of the contract renewal will be changed because without the content they are dead. reply",

But Spotify came along and proved people are ready to pay for something better. ImageMagick is an open source tool for resizing images etc. But some people successfully build API services or SaaS-services on top of it. It works because people AND businesses pay for convenience. What space do you have knowledge of? What pains do people have in that domain that can be solved with tech? Always start with the problem. And start with an industry you know by heart or customer profile you truly care for. For me that was software developers. I was that customer myself.

We basically have full international support these days, but are strongest in Northern Europe. For instance, if you want a virtual mobile phone number in Sweden that supports both SMS and voice, Twilio can’t provide that but we do. Plus we have nicer API if you aks me :) Company name is 46elks. The country code to Sweden is +46 so the name is an hint our service is in the telephony space. reply",

          "text": "We run an API to finetune text-to-image models (dreamlook.ai), as a two-person team. When we launched 3 years ago our differentiator was that we could train both cheaper and faster by running on TPUs, these days GPUs have mostly caught up, and open source models are not as competitive as they once were. It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

Like I never ran into issues with file descriptors on Linux and interview was about C# development well senior level so I guess it is fine. Other time well I have comp sci degree so for a software dev with C# in web development it is perfectly reasonable to ask math questions I wasn’t expecting and then conclude I wasn’t prepared and wasted their time. Well one time it was about C# development and writing code using generics that one I most likely should have practiced more often but I don’t use it as much and it would take me couple hours to brush up on it to be proficient - but was shot down as I couldn’t remember the syntax correctly.

          "text": "8 year old badly wants to be an engineer like his dad. :’) Public school got him into Scratch so he was animating things. The high school robotics team I mentor has Lego robotics kits for their community outreach program. Those kits use Scratch. So I got him a used kit and he spends an absolutely ridiculous amount of time making robots that do stuff. This started at a very young age: we gave him access to a windows PC, not a tablet. So by 3 he could log in and get to YouTube kids. This meant that keyboard and mouse and web browser were very comfortable concepts. We also gave him and his younger brother countless building toys. Meccano. Lego Technic. A few lessons I’d love to empart: - you can’t make your kid into this. His younger brother has no interest and is far more about sports. So we nurture that with him instead. - open ended learning. I’m not sitting down and teaching him.  All I do is make sure he has access to the tools, and I unstick him when he’s stuck. - I connect concepts when I see them. “That’s called a loop. It’s just like that thing you did in Minecraft to make your machine work over and over again.” - the learning must all be a side effect of having fun. Don’t try to teach programming. Do fun things and fill in the programming toolbox, tool by tool, as they’re needed. - connect programming to what your kid is passionate about. Programming is a means to an end, not the end itself.  My kid loves trains and has a Lego train set. I suggested he use his technic to automate the track switch. I then let him work at it for hours and hours over weeks, giving him breadcrumbs of what to consider next. reply",

Example: don’t tell them what a for loop is, make a project where they really need it, but let them first to write it very verbosely without loops, then they will almost invent it themselves and be relived when you teach them (same style can be applied to most things) - make projects that have low entry level, but where they can improve it infinitely. E.g. build an aquarium simulator or a city simulator using p5.js - make them collaborate with other kids if possible, often they learn better from their peers than listening to their parents. Facilitate collaboration, and help them come up with more and more difficult projects, that require more and more of them, so they don’t stay on the same level too long reply",

          "text": "I taught kids how to code for several years, both in person and through a website that taught Python to ~500k kids. My eternal advice with teaching CS is to delay abstractions as long as possible . Teach them how to draw a circle on a canvas, then get them to move the circle to different parts of the canvas, then get them to draw multiple overlapping circles/rectangles/etc. Once you've got that down, make a bouncing ball animation, simple games, and so on. Most kids don't really care for leetcode problems these days, so it's best to stick to things that are visual, creative, and instant-feedback (i.e. games). This was a really useful realization when I was teaching kids to code in person for ~5 years. I started off teaching Java with an abstraction layer ( https://www.bluej.org/ ), but I found that many students would be intimidated by anything that ventured outside of the abstraction (e.g. just run `javac` on your computer with a `.java` file). My most successful students intuitively understood how to turn a text file on their computer into a useful piece of compiled code, or into a JAR bundle that they could share with others. They also used the various abstractions that were thoughtfully introduced over time - e.g. an IDE that gives you a run button, libraries like Firebase which enable some exciting multiplayer game options, and so on. reply",

Just last night, while looking for clear technical information about MCP integration options for Gemini, I found this Google-written article[1], that -- with a positive, hype-compliant spin -- opens with: > Have you ever had something on the tip of your tongue, but you weren’t exactly sure how to describe what’s in your mind? > For developers, this is where \"vibe coding \" comes in. Vibe coding helps developers achieve their vision with models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate code from natural language prompts. Instead of writing every line of code, developers can now describe the desired functionality in plain language. AI translates these \"vibes\" into your vision. That's not thinking. We've even appropriated \"vibe\" terminology, which means something like emotional gut feel, without having to think about it.  (Mostly associated with wake-and-bake stoners, who've self-imposed two-digit IQs and munchies, and who will sometimes speak in terms of \"vibes\", for lack of further analytic capacity.) Recognizing that the top killer app for \"AI\" right now is cheating on homework, the collaborate-with-AI 'skill' is like the well-known collaborate-with-lab-partner.  The lab partner who does all the work, while the slacking student learns nothing, and therefore the slacker fails the exam.  (But, near-term, the slacker might scrape by with a C- for the class, due to copying the lab portion, and due to an instructor who now just wants to be rid of the hopeless student.)

          "text": "Some of what you're arguing agrees with what I said in previous comments in this thread. What I disagree about is pushbutton generative \"AI\" popping out the end product. I want kids to learn by figuring out things as they're building something that they want to build. And when they can't independently invent a concept or technique that they need for something they're building, you can nudge them.  (Example: Their 2D video game screen refreshes are too slow, and now they would be excited to be introduced to double-buffering.  And now they'll know exactly why they need it and how it works.  So, the next time they need a related graphics improvement, they've had that prior learning experience, and might be able to figure it out on their own.) Imagine if young Carmack had been plopped down in front of a vibe coding session for Unity or Unreal, stated what he wanted, and it emitted yet another generic 3D first-person shooter.  Would he have ever been motivated to innovate anything, and if he was, would he have the cognitive strength and learning skill to do so? reply",

This creativity can be captured by coding, maybe, but maybe there are better outlets for the individual. The director of street fighter 5, for example, started as a music composer. I think it's important to really understand our kids. They may not have the experience or vocabulary to have this discussion. Wanting to make a game and coding are different things. You're on the right path in terms of breaking things down into smaller, solvable problems. Coding might be part of it, but translatable skills to making a game might also include leading a band, making a short film, playing team sports, etc. reply",

Focusing on CS fundamentals isn't always worthwhile, unless there's a genuine interest in computer science or math olympiad style problems. Today, we can operate at a higher level since most core algorithms are already available in libraries and frameworks. Just my two cents: if your kids aren't very interested or ready for that kind of knowledge now, you might find that in a few years they can learn it surprisingly quickly if they're interested then. What takes months to teach early on might work in days or hours later. Also, don't forget to explore https://www.alice.org/ it's a 3D way to get started. reply",

          "text": "It's important to remember that the exercise of teaching children coding isn't so much about teaching them how to code, but how to think, how to plan, predict, conjecture, reason and so forth. It's just a convenient and quicker way of teaching these things than the alternatives. If they have a good foundation in these things, then if they choose to go on to coding later they can learn all of the minutiae. But I've found in teaching it is important to stress that learning basic coding is _not_ about steering them towards coding as a career, or even a pursuit. It _is_ important to stress that learning basic coding will help them become better problem solvers, better able to anticipate issues and mitigate them. And that this is useful to them in a wide variety of areas in which they may have interest, such as sports, engineering, adventuring etc. And yes, also learning how to guide an LLM. So once you get those fundamentals down in the context of coding (Scratch, GameMaker, Logo, BASIC are all fine here), go practice them in more real-world applications. Those are the skills you need to foster, not object-oriented programming. And if they take an interest in going further with coding, then that's fine. They will have the tools they need to do that. reply",

I ended up gifting him a book on programming for kids. Then nudging him into working on it every now and again and helping him out when he had issues. Mostly my goal was to make him motivated to learn (showing him interesting projects I had been working on, etc.). From my experience with motivation and time the skills will come themselves, without motivation, every attempt is pointless. It was a slow burner but over the course of four years he ended up learning quite a lot. Now being one of the best programmers in his college. reply",

          "text": "I have 3 kids, all around the same age (K/1). They all got laptops about 18 months ago for christmas. I installed mint linux on all of them, and installed a few free/libre games for them to play, and I self-host the game server at home. One game they play is luanti (formerly minetest). I gave them instructions on how to clone the git repository for the game, run the build script, and then start the game. They've probably forgotten the build instructions, but they know to play, they have to type `cd code/minetest` and then `bin/luanti`. Occasionally they have to run `git pull` to update the code on their computers. I handle all the game server administration. I initially blocked all internet access with a kill switch, but this quickly became an issue because you need to be able to run `apt update` and a few other commands to keep the system up to date. So now I run a proxy server called e2guardian that lets them access sites that I choose. Later, I introduced them to scratch, and I downloaded the entirely of griffpatch's youtube library with yt-dlp and organized it into folders on each of  their computers. I've done the same thing with other tutorial style videos. They don't have access to youtube, and I don't really think it makes sense to give them access at this age. They run scratch locally, as opposed to using scratch.mit.edu. I enabled the scratch website for a couple of days as a treat for them, and as expected, they spent most of the time exploring and playing others' games, but very little time building their own. I sort of expected this to happen, so we closed off access a few days later, and they took some of the ideas they saw online and started playing with them locally. So my experience is: a) linux makes a great platform for kids, since it's very easy to tweak things to stop behaviors that you don't want to reinforce. e.g. `sudo chmod 400 /usr/local/games` turns off all the games, `sudo killall kidname` will close the desktop session if your kid isn't listening when it's time for bed, you can set up time-based login policies with pam_time, you can install your own root certificates for SSL MITM, etc. b) games reinforce that \"computers are fun\", and games like luanti are free, open-source, and hackable. c) interest in games naturally spills over into interest in making your own games. If you want to try luanti/minetest, I recently cleaned up/released a mod that I built for the kids last year called turtlebots. It's a visual programming tool that lets you program little turtle-shaped robots that can navigate in a minecraft-style world and build things as they move around.

That's a good way to use lare(ish) models in commodity hardware. Normally with llama-cpp you specifiy how many (full) layers you want to put in GPU (-ngl) . But CPU-offloading specific tensors that don't require heavy computation , saves GPU space without affecting speed that much. I've also read a paper on loading only \"hot\" neurons into the cpu [2] .

Something that is more accurate but put in a boring way will often be downvoted, while straight up incorrect but funny/emotional/\"fitting the group think\" comments usually get upvoted. For us who've spent a lot of time on the web, this sort of bullshit detector is basically built-in at this point, but if you're new to places where the group think is so heavy as on reddit, it's worth being careful taking anything at face value. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you. But I'm still happy to hang out here and get into (hopefully) illuminating discussions. reply",

I'd be shocked if they (you?) were banned just for critiquing Musk. So please link the post. I'm prepared to be shocked. I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive.

Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful.

It's really hard to say one model is better than another in a general way, since it depends on so many things like your use case, the prompts, the settings, quantization, quantization method and so on. If you're building/trying to build stuff depending on LLMs in any capacity, the first step is coming up with your own custom benchmark/evaluation that you can run with your specific use cases being put under test. Don't share this publicly (so it doesn't end up in the training data) and run it in order to figure out what model is best for that specific problem. reply",

I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

          "text": "I completely disagree. I don't see the current status quo fundamentally changing. That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results.

General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

          "text": "(I worked at a different processing company, which I am not speaking for.) We're struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). The highest likelihood for me is that they're doing card/credential testing. They have either stolen or purchased a large number of stolen credentials. Those credentials are worth more individually if they are known to function. They can use any business on the Internet which sells anything and would tell someone \"Sorry, can't sell you that because I couldn't charge your account/card/etc. Do you have another one?\" to quickly winnow their set of credentials into a pile of ones which haven't been canceled yet and another pile. Another variation of this attack is their list is \"literally just enumerate all the cards possible in a range and try to sift down to the cards that actually exist.\" After sifting through to find the more valuable cards, they sell this onto another attacker at higher price of the mixed-working-and-not-working cards, or they pass it to their colleague who will attempt to hit the cards/creds for actual money. Digital items are useful because people selling them have high margins and have lower defenses against fraud as a result. Cheap things, especially cheap things where they can pick their price, are useful because it is less likely to trigger the attention of the card holder or their bank. (This is one reason charities get abused very frequently, because they will often happily accept a $1 or lower donation, even one which is worth less than their lowest possible payment processing cost.) The bad guys don't want to be noticed because the real theft is in the future, by them or (more likely) by someone they sell this newly-more-valuable card information onto. This hit the company I used to run back in the day, also on Paypal, and was quite frustrating. I solved it by adding a few heuristics to catch and giving a user matching those heuristics the product for free, with the usual message they got in case of a successful sale. This quickly spoils your website for the purpose they're trying to use it for, and the professional engineering team employed to abuse you experiences thirty seconds of confusion and regret before moving to the next site on their list. Back in the day, the bad guys were extremely bad at causing their browser instance to even try to look like a normal user in terms of e.g. pattern of data access prior to attempting to buy a thing. Hope some of that is useful. Best of luck and skill. You can eventually pierce through to Paypal's attention here and they may have options available contingent on you being under card/credential testing attack, or they might not. I was not successful in doing so back in the day prior to solving the problem for myself. Would also recommend building monitoring so you know this is happening in the future before the disputes roll in. Note that those disputes might be from them or from the legitimate users depending on exactly what credentials they have stolen, and in the case they are from legitimate users, you may not have caught all of the fraudulent charges yet. (Mentioning because you said \"all of the charges\" were disputed.) If I were you I'd try to cast a wider net and pre-emptively refund or review things in the wider net, both because the right thing to do and also because you may be able to head off more disputes later as e.g. people get their monthly statements. reply",

When the threat level is high, you require an exact match AVS.  You might have more agressive filtering at the IP level, real users generally won't be datacenter IPs.  Pay attention to the ASN, sometimes you'll get an attack from a network that legit customers never use, so you can just block the whole network.  Keep an eye on your logs, you'll notice patterns.  The attack is likely coming from a single entity, if you make it difficult to abuse your service, then they will move on. reply",

          "text": "This is a money laundering scheme where they are trying out how far they can go per domain. It's also a bug in the paypal API that they're abusing, where the SDK doesn't differ between example.com and www.example.com. If webshops like yours get exploited and used for money laundering, they will mix transactions from those two subdomains, while leaving the www.example.com domain as it is. The support people at paypal are dumb enough to not take care about each case, and usually they mix transactions later also via other social media services that have microtransactions (e.g. tiktok or snapchat streams where you can gift away items). The way paypal support's workflow works is that they have to nanually identify each and every transaction separately, meaning a human will be busy for weeks on end. Not kidding you. That's how the scammers keep winning with schemes like this. Usually there's also no way to escalate this, not even for business customers, at paypal, due to how their support offices are structured organizationally. As a mitigation I'd recommend to block ASNs that are known hosters that do this, and double check your webshop version for known vulnerabilities and fixes. If you don't use docker already, start to virtualize your webshop software now. I can't stress how important this is. Also double check any users and passwords you are using for the services, and the rest of the filesystem for indicators on the VPS. Disable SSH passwords and use only SSH key authentication on the VPS in case this hasn't been done already. I'm writing this because usually this kind of scheme starts to happen after the server got pwned already, and after e.g. the ssh password bruteforce scanner was successful or after the web exploit / persistence exploit was successful. If you need a starting point to block those botnet affiliated networks, I started both a firewall and scam database project that does exactly this: [1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam [2] https://github.com/tholian-network/firewall reply",

If you are a beginner, instead make sure you don't run services as the sudo-capable/root user as a first step.\nThen, I would recommend you look into Systemd services: you can configure all the Linux sandboxing features Docker uses and more.\nThis composes well with Podman, which gives you a reproducible environment (drop-in replacement for Docker) but contained to an unprivileged user. reply",

Everything \"service A\" needs is stored inside the container blob (including some minimal ubuntu 18.04 stuff). the magic that lets this happen -- containers re-use the host server's OS kernel. Running a new ubuntu 18.04 container does not start a new OS kernel running. the process for your container is just 'firewalled' off from all other processes using cgroups [0]. containers re-use the host's kernel, start a cgroup'd process which starts your container's services and processes (the 18.04 'OS' services and your binary/code/executable). short/simpler version: containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. > If you want actual isolation you have to take extra steps. unfortunately, this means containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. containers not being isolated from the host server OS can present a security risk as you can escape from the container and \"do bad things to host server\". [1] In cases where that is a problem you mostly have two choices: * use VMs instead (a completely isolated OS instance is started for each service, cannot interact with the host OS at all -- this uses a lot more memory/cpu) * use rootless containers [2] (container processes are launched under a specific user namespace rather than kernel namespace -- escaping the container means you only get access to the user namespace) [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups [1]: by default the docker daemon service and all the container processes it starts are running as root, which means escaping out of a container in a a default docker installation is as bad as giving someone root.

          "text": "Im not op and I’m not sure they are using it for money laundering. A money launderer can use a marketplace by creating a seller account and buying from himself. Since he’s the one buying he doesn’t need to deliver anything but he gets the money from a legit source. Usually he would use a payment method as close to money as possible so that it leaves less traces. But in OPs case, the amounts are low so he needs too many transactions to get something valuable. And because of the disputes, he’s (probably) not getting the money (?). It could be card testing: the fraudster has a bunch of cards and doesn’t know which is valid or canceled. The best way to find out is to test in a real site. So he’ll test out each of them and the ones that go through are good to use elsewhere. The thing is that it would be better for him not to dispute the transactions so the OP would take much longer to find out about the scheme and shut it down. It’s better to use low amount transactions in this case so it doesn’t use too much of the credit available for him to defraud and probably doesn’t warn the card owner. Another option is doing it just to hurt the OP marketplace. If you have too many disputes the brands can fine you and if you don’t solve the problem they can turn your account off. I’ve seen it happen when a competitor was trying to hurt the e-commerce. It’s a low move and rare but it happens. One thing that might help is to analyze the sellers too. In a money laundering and even in the other settings, it could be part of the scheme. Are they new accounts? Are their volume exploding out of nowhere? Etc reply",

But, is this not easily spotted when the food import(?) cost doesn't match the revenue?

          "text": "+1. As mentioned on the side, this will negatively impact your conversion rate. But you don't need to leave it on forever, either; you can use it to get some breathing room. The attacker may lose interest or move on to more fruitful targets if they find themselves blocked even temporarily. This is the \"don't need to be faster than the bear\" dynamic of online fraud: there are infinite targets and you don't need to perfectly shut out an attacker to make the ROI unappealing for them. My thoughts on the scenario: 1. Chargebacks are not just a financial problem. There is no amount of money you can pay to regain the trust of your sellers (as it's a marketplace) or to change terms with your payment providers. 2. If the emails come from the same domain, can you block the domain? There are lots of throwaway domains, but it's effort for the attacker to switch them, too. 3. CAPTCHAs are increasingly ineffective between captcha solving services and multi-modal AI. I've heard in a few recent attacks that hCaptcha does a little better than Turnstile or reCAPTCHA. 4. Shadowbanning is good for wasting your attacker's time, which is really important to kill their ROI. You'll need to get your false positive rate low though to not piss off your actual good customers. 5. Your scenario (no API, browser required, no bot activity expected) is a really good fit for properly implemented device fingerprinting. I'm the PM for Fraud & Security at Stytch and we do have a Device Fingerprinting product. It's harder to trial than the open-source ones, but the advantage is that attackers can't inspect the implementation to evade it. Would you be interested in talking more? I'm happy to walk through your current controls and see if it makes sense to test Device Fingerprinting, shoot me an email at (first letter of my username) + (last four letters of my username) @ stytch.com . reply",

Their support sucks and is completely unhelpful, managing your account was at the time extremely complex, compared any other payment solution. Our rule taking PayPal: Transfer EVERYTHING out of your PayPal account on a daily basis, do not let them hold your funds, they will block you from accessing it at some point. Minimize what they can touch. Also don't all smaller amounts to be paid with PayPal. This prevents you from being abused as a source for verifying stolen accounts. The only company I dealt with that came close to the same level of incompetency was Klarna. Klarna didn't at the time understand the concept of fraud, because they're Swedish and their system in Sweden MOSTLY prevented fraud at the time. Once people found away around that and Klarna expanded beyond Sweden, they gave up and attempted to stick the bill on us, despite their contracts clearly stated that they where responsible for collecting payments. reply",

You need to treat every one of these chargeback transactions as a risk to your businesses ability to operate, each that you allow to happen increases the risk of permanent damage to your business. Reach out to your account manager at PayPal, this is not something that should be going via frontline support. You need to be talking to a person who knows and is responsible for your account. If you don’t have one, get one. If you can’t get one, look for anti payment fraud businesses that work with PayPal, they may be able to get a direct line to PayPal on your behalf. For the future, if you’re dependent upon a service provider you should always have someone you can reach out to directly. If a provider isn’t willing to offer that, find a different provider. Financial services especially are very risk averse and will jettison your account if they get even a whiff of something untoward, whether you tried to prevent it or not. The cost of recovering from that will dwarf the cost of any drastic mitigation you take now. Losing your PayPal account is worse than turning off purchases for a few days. reply",

          "text": "Pasted my written advice to this founder here, to be helpful to the community as a whole. These are all free/cheap things you can do when you're early on and being picked on by the baddies: - *Track anonymous user sessions*, even if you delete all anonymous sessions every 24 hours to prevent data accumulation, this will do wonders when it comes to tracking a user on their \"approach\" to your payment experience. It should be cheap-as-free to log some of these events so you can identify different populations of users based on how many \"typical\" events they skipped. With this, you are looking for users that skipped essential or common steps. - *Get some sort of free device fingerprinting tool in place at or before your payments experience.*  \n  [ https://github.com/thumbmarkjs/thumbmarkjs ]( https://github.com/thumbmarkjs/thumbmarkjs ) ← this is a MIT fork of Fingerprint.js after they changed their license. It's a great starting point, and while these can be blocked or manipulated, it does a TON to raise the bar on would-be attackers. With this, you are looking for users with the same device hitting your payments experience over and over, and people who are blocking this script from running. - *Some IP reputation vendors have a free tier API (e.g. IPQualityScore)* that might be helpful at the volumes you are working with, just be sure to cache lookups so you aren't making a bunch of API calls to get the reputation of the same IP over and over. With this, you are looking for IPs that either have a poor reputation or are classified as VPNs/Residential IP Proxies/Cloud Proxies. - *Lastly, keep a running rate for your payment failure ratio over the last 20 + 60 minutes.*  \n  This lets you put logic in place that automatically puts more strict controls in place if your payment acceptance rate dips below 90% and transactions are above a certain minimum threshold - this should let you sleep a little easier knowing that your mitigations automatically shift to \"battlestations\" if an attack goes off while you are sleeping or out with your family. *Being clear:* cookies, device fingerprints, and IPs are pretty easily manipulated by a motivated attacker - checking behavior across all three at the same time significantly raises the bar for a would-be attacker. This should keep you out of the hottest water until you get to a size & scale of attack pressure where you might want to consider using my startup's platform to proactively classify and honeypot malicious user behavior. reply",

I have a (few years old) copy of Library Genesis converted to plaintext and it's around 1TB. I think libgen proper was 50-100TB at the time, so we can probably assume that AA (~1PB) would be around 10-20TB when converted to plaintext. You'd probably spend several weeks torrenting a chunk of the archive, converting everything in it to plaintext, deleting the originals, then repeating with a new chunk until you have plaintext versions of everything in the archive. Then indexing all that for full text search would take even more storage and even more time, but still perfectly doable on commodity hardware. The main barriers are going to be reliably extracting plaintext from the myriad of formats in the archive, cleaning up the data, and selecting a decent full text search database (god help you if you pick wrong and decide you want to switch and re-index everything later). reply",

Another, arguably equivalent way of framing it: the job of an LLM isn't to provide you with the facts; it's main job is to understand what you mean . The \"WIM\" in \"DWIM\". Making it do that does require stupid amounts of data and tons of compute in training. Currently, there's no better way, and the only alternative system with similar capabilities are... humans.

Everybody and their dog torrenting petabytes of data and getting away with it (Meta is the only one that got caught and they've still gotten away with doing it)? The very same data poor American students were forced to commit suicide over? The same data that average American housewives were sued over for millions of dollars of \"damages\"? The same data that often gets random German plumbers or steelworkers to pay thousands of euros of \"fines\" to the copyright mafia so they won't get sued and have their lives ruined? Yet when giant corporations are doing the exact same thing on a massive scale, it's fine? It's not even the same thing, an American student torrenting books isn't making any money off it, while Meta very much is. Of course it's not the same, a simple-minded and poorly educated person like me isn't capable of understanding the difference.

Honestly was too tired to point that out in my earlier reply, but that's exactly the kind of argument you get when people are not willing (or purposefully refusing) to consider details. Intentionally or not, you get bogus and highly manipulative statements. A single case of a student activist fighting for freedom of communication and access to public goods for citizens, ending up breaking under pressure from public/non-profit institutions MIT, JSTOR, FBI over copyright, is not the same as what GP implied - many students, regular folks just like you and me, being forced to take their own lives due to legal consequences of pirating books in bulk. Nothing like the latter ever happened anyway. We can do better than this. (And even if we can't, I trust the courts can.) -- [0] - Curiously, while doing some search now to be sure I didn't miss any similar case, I learned that JSTOR incident wasn't the first for 'aaronsw - apparently, he did the same thing a few years earlier with public court documents[1]; FBI investigated this too, and concluded he was legally in the clear. It's probably well-known to everyone here, but I somehow missed it, so #TodayILearned.

They used their infinite VC money supply to interfere with and delay investigations and enforcement, betting that if they do it fast enough, they'll have the general population on their side. LLM vendors found and exploited[0] a legal uncertainty - correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK it still isn't settled whether or not their actions were actually illegal. Unlike Uber, LLM vendors aren't breaking into markets by ignoring the laws to outcompete incumbents, and burning stupid amounts of money just to get away with it. On the contrary, LLM vendors are simply providing an actually useful product, and charging a reasonable price for it, while reinvesting it into improving the product. Effects it has on other markets aside[1], their business model is just providing actual value in exchange for money. That's much more direct and honest than most of the tech industry . The product itself is also different. Uber is selling a mirage, a \"miracle\" improvement that quickly turns not so, and is destined to eventually destroy the markets it disrupted. LLM vendors are developing and serving systems that provide actual value to users, directly and obviously so. -- [0] - Probably walked into this without initially realizing it. No one complained 5-10 years ago, where the datasets were smaller and the resulting models had no real-world utility. It's only when the models became useful, that some people started looking for ways to make them go away.

Converting media that is currently completely un-indexed into plaintext and offering a suite of search features for finding content within it would be a game-changer, IMO! If you've ever done a lit review for any field other than ML, I'm guessing you know how reliant many fields are on relatively-old books and articles (read: PDFs at best, paper-only at worst) that you can basically only encounter via a) citation chains, b) following an author, or c) encyclopedias/textbooks. 2. I really don't see how this could ever lead to any kind of legal issue. You're not hosting any of the content itself, just offering a search feature for it. GoodReads doesn't need legal permission to index popular books, for example. In general I get the sense that your comment is written from the perspective of an entrepreneur/startup mindset. I'm sure that's brought you meaning and maybe even some wealth, but it's not a universal one!

The Pirate Bay is (imo correctly, even if I disagree with other aspects about copyright law and its enforcement) seen as a place where people go to find ways to not pay authors for their content. They never hosted a copyrighted byte but they're banned in some form (DNS, IP, domain seizures) in many countries. Proxies of TPB also, so being like an ISP for such a site is already enough, whereas nobody is ordering blocks of Comcast's IP addresses for providing access to websites with copyrighted material because they didn't have a somewhat-provable intent to provide copyright infringement When I read the OP, I imagine this would link from the search results directly to Anna's archive and sci-hub, but I think you'd have to spin it as a general purpose search page and ideally not even mention AA was one of the sources, much less have links (Don't get me wrong: everyone wants this except the lobby of journals that presently own the rights) It would be a real shame if an anonymous third party that's definitely not the website operator made a Firefox add-on that illegitimately inserts these links to search results page though reply",

So you come up with a list of books you want to prioritize, search the DB for torrent name and file to download, download only the files you need, and extract them. You’ll probably end up with quite a few more books, which you may index or skip for now, but it is certainly doable. reply",

I was tinkering around with something like this for academic papers in Zotero, and the main issue I ran into was words spilling over to the next page, and footnotes. I totally gave up on that endeavour several years ago, but the tooling has probably matured exponentially since then. As an example, all the academic paper hubs have been using this technology for decades. I'd wager that all of the big Gen AI companies have planned to use this exact dataset, and many or them probably have already. reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have >500 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

Timescale extends PostgreSQL to handle relational data, time-series, events, real-time analytics, and vector search in a single application database. It’s built for data-heavy, mission-critical apps while retaining the familiarity and reliability of Postgres. Ideal for IoT, crypto, finance, SaaS, and more. Database code all available on github; we don’t have any “enterprise versions”, so all our database code is available for the community for free. Currently, see more than 3 million databases running TimescaleDB a month. That’s because our commercial focus is on our fully-managed cloud platform, so in addition to folks implementing the core database (C, Rust), we’re also heavily hiring for folks with operational cloud & database experience at scale (Kubernetes with custom k8s operators, Golang, etc), as well as folks interested in providing highly technical support, database release engineering, and building database testing infrastructure (think performance analysis, distributed database correctness testing, etc.) And product folks to support these efforts & all our users!

We have two of the largest self hosted ClickHouse clusters out there (and growing rapidly) each with Petabytes of data. We are working on really interesting solutions to problems that we would love to open source for the broader CH ecosystem: - Declarative, cluster aware migrations - Iceberg and S3 backed merge tree's on ClickHouse (as performant as local MergeTrees) - ClickHouse on K8s, but on Metal instances w/ NVMe used for caching and compaction. - Load shedding query scheduler and eventually query optimizer We have a broad charter when it comes to ClickHouse. It's one of the things that enables us to build so many products that share the same underlying data and context. Our goal is to enable all developers at PostHog to continue building these products quickly as the team and user-base scales. It's honestly an exciting time to be working at this company and on the beating heart of what drives it. Chat with me if you have any questions! reply",

Our tech stack includes Python, backend Typescript, Postgres and, increasingly, Rust, although the latter is not a Day-1 requirement. We review all applications personally.

From budgeting tools that prevent overspending to AI-driven insights that surface patterns in your spending, Klutch lets users shape how their credit card works for them. Our core belief: financial products should be programmable, transparent, and intelligent. We're looking for builders to help shape this vision: Fullstack Developer – Kotlin + React. You'll ship end-to-end features, build new mini-apps, and contribute to the internal platform that powers them. Product Designer – Help define a UX model for composable finance—where users can mix and match tools that feel tailored to them. Product Manager – Own a domain like AI Insights or Budget Controls. You'll define the roadmap, talk to users, and launch products quickly. We use Kotlin (Exposed, Ktor), React + Next.js, AWS (Fargate, Lambda), MySQL, and Mongo. Our stack also supports integrating AI models directly into mini-apps.

Rob worked at Fin (human-in-the-loop AI executive assistant, before LLMs) and was founding engineer at Substack. We started our first product, Substrate in 2023, a platform for building agentic workflows, and raised an $8M seed round led by Lightspeed [2]. We were pushing the envelope on both infra (serving multi-model workloads efficiently) and developer experience (ahead of our time in several ways) [3]. Though we found solid traction with startups, we realized inference was a red ocean especially upmarket, and decided to spin down the product/team at the end of 2024. We've spent the last 6 months prototyping and discarding ideas, and we’re now gearing up to launch our latest vision, a consumer AI application.

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork. We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems. Pleas remember that we are looking for NYC local only, no exceptions at this time :(.

          "text": "Do this course https://github.com/henki-robotics/robotics_essentials_ros2 Totally free, don't need to buy anything just a computer. I've been designing electrical hardware for robots for the last 4 years for a big corporation and I can tell you, the fun and money is in the software but having another skill is awesome. Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow. Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project. If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper. As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank. Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are. And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective. reply",

          "text": "I'm in the field and I disagree with the initial direction of this post. You aren't going to 'learn robotics' in a meaningful manner by checking the boxes in a online ROS2 course. Robotics is a compound discipline which pairs mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge with mathematics and software development. In order to get meaningful practice in all of these areas, I would recommend re-implementing a robot vacuum from 'scratch'. The actual vacuum part is non-essential, as you're really trying to implement the famous 'turtle' robot and experience all the design steps/compromises/challenges first hand. As a goal, aim for autonomous navigation around your home that works equivalently to a cheap 'throwaway' robo-vac. Keep in mind you are surrounded by robotics. Most passenger vehicles, consumer drones, micro-mobility devices and modern construction equipment are 'robots in varying degrees of disguise'. Practical knowledge regarding any of these systems transfers well if you know where to apply it. reply",

          "text": "Microcontrollers and PLC are historically different fields that have some overlap as the fields converge somewhat. PLC come from relay logic and so learning Ladder Logic and playing with a cheaper Automation Direct PLC might be good if you're looking to do control systems like industrial machines and those robotics. RPi series micros are good to learn embedded electronics, servo controls and Realtime OS. Computer Engineering and Control System Engineering are treated differently even in the California State Engineering License Exams, so they tend to be different paths but the skills have some overlap. My degree was in computer engineering and didn't cover any PLC, but I contract and PLC comes up a lot in one-off things that need to be reliable. reply",

          "text": "Yeah. As some has said already PLC are more oriented to robotic arms in factories etc, where space is not a premium.  Robots like anymal from anybotics, spot from boston dynamics or the unidog from unitree to name a few don't use PLC at all due to lack of space. Also energy efficiency, mcu at most will push less than a watt to move something complex, a motor control for the FOC, I mentioned earlier. I worked for the past 4 years in HP siteprint.The main problem was developing all to fit inside a pelican case that you could check in on a plane. The smallest PLC was almost the full internal volume of the robot. That's why I said microcontrollers, more ready available to experiment at home, faaaaaaaar more cheaper and those two, very well documented. STM32 in europe is the big player but is harder to get into, the documentation tends to be cahotic. reply",

          "text": "This is by far one of the best ways to learn IMO https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_a... The idea of that game is that you build vehicles to do rescues and deal with natural disasters. While there is a career mode where you gain currency that you can spend on parts and fuel, most people who play that game play it in sandbox mode where you essentially design vehicles to do certain things, while also configuring the game to chose missions it generates. For example, you can make it so you only have to deal with land rescue missions or only fight enemy ai. The building system is VERY in depth.  While you don't have to worry about structural strength, you do have to keep things in mind like part placement, CG location, internal volume for buoyancy for ships. Then you get to propulsion, which you have to build out of components - the game has a fairly indepth internal combustion engine simulator where you build custom engines, and have to make sure they are fed with adequate fuel, air, and cooled appropriately. You can do jet engines, you can do nuclear, you can do full electric, and so on. Then you have to build systems to do missions - for example, to transport a container you have to build a crane to be able to pick it up. Finally, the game features a microcontroller system which is the bread and butter of doing cool things. There is a bunch of sensors that can read data (GPS, laser distance, pitch, roll, heading, radar, e.t.c), which you can route into a microcontroller, and do math either with logic blocks or Lua code, and thats how you build automation. You will get very familiar with things like PID controller tuning, trigonometry math (for things like distance sensing), state machine coding practices, and other things that are all applicable to the real world. reply",

          "text": "I couldn't agree more. FIRST is an excellent organization to get involved with. Even if you don't have specialities which directly align with the needs of a team, most will not turn you away (especially if you demonstrate passion). Just a few thoughts about starting a team and/or volunteering: Starting a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team is not for the feint-of-heart and requires significant time and money investment. This is the sort of endeavor you try when you're either retired or have a group of other dedicated volunteers willing to help you build the team over multiple seasons. If you spend a year or two mentoring/volunteering for a well-established team, you'll get a good sense of what you're getting into. FRC is a bit hardcore. If no FRC teams exist nearby, FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a good entrypoint, but may not be technical enough for an adult interested in using FIRST to gain exposure to robotics. (It is plenty satisfying to mentor these teams, but Mindstorms can be somewhat limiting.) These are geared toward using Lego Mindstorms for learning robot concepts. A good middle ground (for exposure to more practical robotics) would be volunteering with a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. It's the middle ground between FLL and FRC and is _doable_ for a single, dedicated, passionate adult to start (though I'd strongly recommend finding another volunteer to pursue this with). If getting involved with a team is not an option, seek out nearby FIRST events that you can volunteer at. Many competition events need volunteers and you'll get a chance to interact with local teams and find plenty of opportunities to play with robots. reply",

          "text": "Two bits of advice: just jump in, and set reasonable expectations for yourself. Robotics is a field filled with layers upon layers of complexity, theory, and real-world problems. Those at the top of the game (think robust dog robots, walking bipedal star wars droids, high-speed and high-torque many-DOF arm platforms) are leveraging learnings and expensive prototypes from decades of work/research to achieve those feats. This is not to be discouraging, but to say - they all started somewhere - you too can start, and maybe you won't build things like that today, but you can get there. And the cool thing is all that robotics work by experts has made the barrier to entry much lower - today you can choose to apply money to solve problems you don't want to learn and focus on the things you do want to learn, in ways that weren't possible 10 years ago. Need a powerful closed loop motor system? Buy an ODrive or closed-loop stepper platform off the shelf, and focus on how to apply those systems to build something higher level. But the big difference with learning hardware/robotics compared to software (speaking from experience having watched a lot of really smart people struggle to get robots working when I ran an MIT robotics competition, 6.270, and was a lab assistant for another course, 6.141) is that the real world is unforgiving in a way that software is generally not. So if you come from a software background, you will find that robotics can have so many more setbacks because nothing ever moves/behaves/reacts in a precisely predictable way in physical space. This is why I say just jump in - you'll have fun learning all the ways things go wrong, and they faster you get that learning out of the way, the sooner you can build things that work reliably! Try things and figure out how and why they don't work, and iterate. But don't set unrealistically high expectations or it will just be frustrating. reply",

I'm not entirely sure how to make that more 'accessible'. It's like, spend the next 5 years of your life mastering difficult math and electronics so that the sensors can be integrated into feedback that stabilizes a motor system. I guess you can cheat and use servos for a lot of this (where an EE already solved many feedback loop issues).

But then do your best to avoid the Masters level demons that plague this problem set. Maybe learn PID controller theory and if that isn't enough for your problems, give up and try a different design. PID is simple enough that you won't need years of math to learn, but it's very adhoc to configure and not always the best methodology to use. Better than nothing though. reply",

Even the simplest systems will fail pretty badly outside lab. No two robots will work the same. As a grad student those are the things you learn on top of IK at work. So if you get employed for designing actual 6+ DoF systems and missing the theoretical stuff you'll be way behind.

          "text": "A really top-tier robotics engineer is going to be a generalist across mechanical, electrical, and several software domains, and then also a specialist, deep expert in one or two of those. So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours. I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons. reply",

          "text": "Honestly, and I feel like a promoter… but get either a hackpack from Mark Rober or as otherwise mentioned, mindstorms from LEGO. Crunch labs: https://www.crunchlabs.com/ As someone in the industry (I literally can call myself a Robot Master having a Masters Degree in Robotics), these simple “kid kits” are phenomenal. When you first start out, the hardest part is knowing the hardware is actually going to do what you tell it to do. Simplifying the mechanical engineering/electrical engineering so you can immediately create real world actions makes a huge difference in giving you motivation to keep going. Once you have the basics in place and you understand mechanisms, sensors, and some algorithms, you can move on to other parts of robotics. However, keep in mind robotics is really about system thinking… you have to understand trades between sensing, thinking, and acting. But most importantly you have to remember you are dealing with the real world… you can’t as easily write a unit test and know that a particular actuator will behave exactly the same way every time. reply",

          "text": "There are many ways to start with a more academic knowledge of robotics. Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care. It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch. This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot. As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more \"formal\" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist. My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT! For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for <$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive. For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all. For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running. As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach. reply",

If you are interested in getting this One Amazing Thing working, great!  You have the motivation and cranking through what you'll need to lean to succeed will be possible. IF, on the other hand, you want to make 1e6 of these things (\"tech giants seems to capture most of the conversation\")-- that a completely different story.  You're going to need a skilled team, ideally one that has been to a rodeo before.    I can't help you there. But if you're building one, for fun --- Just DO It.  Ask friendly robotics club members when you get stuck.  IF your problem is particularly and singularly unique, then whatever domain that entails, you will need to master; that's your Secret Sauce. Ivan Sutherland, who was Thesis Advisor to CMU's first Robotics Institute PhD said something to the effect that after 4 years of a Robotics PhD program, you end up with the ability to solder and attach connectors with a high degree of confidence. A True Roboticists requires deep knowledge in mathematics, software engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing small lots, reliability engineering, materials engineering, data collection & graphical evaluation methodologies..... What one might call a Systems Engineer's handbag.  It also helps to be inspired by the wonders of nature that biology affords us. The details?   eh, they change.  Whether you used some hot cpu, some hot language, some hot OS --- Marc Raibert's hopping & jumping robots used C and BSD4.3 Unix, with the kernel locks cleaned up (reduced) so a 1 kHz kernel interrupt stream could be supported on a 1 MIPS machine (Vax 780).  Timesharing was never stopped, but the kernel did get quite a large percentage of CPU cycles. I'll repeat: Just do it.  Start.  Move forward.

Turns out an advanced grad-student software group had brought me in (back in 2004) because their grad students couldn't build reliable software for the real world, and their military \"research partners\" were getting rather p.o.'d. \nBut I'm a non-degreed Mechatronics Systems Engineer, in the truest sense of the word. I'm old enough to predate software engineering programs. \nI learned robotics and automation because I was curious, it fueled my ADD, and I kept at it... in the beginning I used plug-in cards for the IBM PC, but I knew basic electronics as a hobby (ham radio, telephonics, heathkit, etc.) and I devoured books. Anything I could get my hands on. Especially Byte magazine and Steve Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar columns.\nSo get copies of Forest Mims III stuff, and get an arduino or raspberry pi (you can even get/run Codesys on a pi, to learn PLC stuff) and get magazine issues/books from Make: and watch lots of youtube from ElectroBoom and AvE and get your hands dirty. \nRemember, you can be skilled at robotics without building Optimus. Currently I'm building and programming high speed mail handling equipment. Not sexy, but it pays the bills and fuels my dopamine. It's all servomotors and sensors and decision logic. And challenging too, paper's moving at 1/8\" per millisecond at mid-speeds, you need to be an efficient coder and pre-optimizing your logic, and it's all state machines, all the way down. \nGood luck. I make bank, but I'm driven in a thousand directions and I push and I try and while I may be wrong 70% of the time, that would get me into the allstar game if it was baseball!\nNever give up, and never surrender!

This may be what you are referring to. I haven't tried it much but those layouts could be a temporary solution. I found Qwerty to be a lot easier to type one handed straight up because Dvorak tries to alternate hands between keys. I recently discovered Talon, an open source app for voice control of basically everything on a machine that requires no typing at all. I saw some people are using it even if they can use their hands, as a power tool. It appears to be fully Python scriptable and also gives you some nice speech to text abilities too. It allows you to specify a bunch of keywords for typing symbols and it looks like some people can do full coding quite quickly. Perhaps this injury could be an opportunity to try something like this and become more powerful than before? Best of luck and recovery to your friend. https://talonvoice.com/ reply",

          "text": "I'll second the steep learning curve for the twiddler.  I never got up to a typing speed on it that was not horribly, frustratingly, slow.  But, I only needed it for a couple months. Like OP's relative, I also could not use my dominant arm, nor have my arm in a position that would allow typing one handed on a regular keyboard.  The twiddler was the only commercially available option that I was able to find that would allow me to type in this state.  So, another recommendation of twiddler, but with the caveat that the original had several warts, and while they appear to be redesigned, they may still suffer from some of them. The velcro strap to hold it to the hand, combined with the shape of the keyboard, allowed it to shift position while typing making it harder to use.  Photos of the current models show they have a different shape now.  Maybe this is less of a problem now?  They are also wireless now, so there isn't a wire constantly pulling it out of position whenever you move. The keyboard markings rubbed off completely after only a few weeks of use on my OG twiddler.  Hopefully they have worked that manufacturing issue out for the current models. reply",

          "text": "Once their finger movement has been restored, I'd look into various large-split keyboards.  The Kinesis Freestyle2 USB version has a large split (20\") option that could help.  They have screw hole mounts on the bottom which you could likely jerry-rig with a sling to put the keyboard in the proper position.  I used it with a custom 3d-printed mount so that I could attach it to the arms of my chair. The wireless version has less of a gap, but you could always just get two of them and use the left half of one and the right half of another. Feel free to reach out to me at justin (at) justin-c (dot) com, if you want to talk.  I spent about 5 years working on custom mounting options for keyboards after getting a severe RSI, ultimately proven to be partially caused by a rheumatic condition. reply",

          "text": "Another thing worth mentioning, if they are a coder, is that this is one of the places where some of the LLM tools can really shine.  Many people provide a rough spec, then either (shutter) vibe-code or edit substantially once it produces it. Having a RSI myself, I find that I can provide very detailed instructions in regular english, for which voice dictation works quite well to Cursor (but any others should work too), then it will produce code that I have to edit very little.  For most people this wouldn't be an efficient flow, but it greatly helps me reduce typing, thus is beneficial to me. With something like that, I believe you could do well pecking around with one hand for edits without needing to do much typing. On Mac, Karabiner-Elements is incredibly useful to remap things, such that you can enable things like mousekeys or otherwise that would keep from having to move (either) hand very much.  It's also a way to do as others have shown on this post and do a mirror layout or add something analogous to layers without having to buy new keyboards. reply",

          "text": "There is Edgar Matias's \"Half Keyboard\" layout, where the right hand's keys of a regular keyboard are mirrored on the left hand when holding a modifier key with your thumb.\nThe idea is that if you have learned touch-typing then muscle memory for the right hand should be available also on the left. Matias wrote an article [1] about it and then made it into a commercial product [2], but the concept should be possible on any programmable keyboard.\nPerhaps it would be possible with a AutoHotkey (MS-Windows) or Karabiner (MacOS) script otherwise. There is a large scene for more-or-less DIY \"ergonomic\" mechanical programmable keyboards with various different physical layouts, but common themes are 1) that they are split in a pair of two physical keyboards and 2) that they have multiple thumb-keys for modifiers / Return / Space. You could build and program just one half of such a pair.\nMany years ago I programmed an ErgoDox with the HalfKeyboard layout, just to try it out, and that ErgoDox I had built on a budget from mostly salvaged vintage components.

I figured the time was short enough that I would just use a regular keyboard, one handed, and live with the slowdown. It was annoying, certainly, and while I did get faster typing only with my left hand, I of course never got close to full speed. But it was fine, I survived, and I don't think it would have been worth spending the money, as well as the time to learn a new keyboard setup. Remember that a one-handed keyboard (or some other arrangement) isn't going to bring you back up to full speed immediately. It's probably going to take a few weeks to learn, and you might not even get back up to full speed at all. reply",

Honestly, if you aren't used to one handed typing its not worth the time to train to get good at it(I'm assuming they're right hand dominant) its all just muscle memory. If they can pick it up quickly go for it, keyboard bindings, or something like predictive text assistance, or even vim-like remappings are an interesting idea. IMO - if possible just peck-type(like an old lady who is learning to use a keyboard) or use text to speech/AI & editing where possible - like in emails.

First the small market, not a lot of potential customers, a lot of development costs and high per-unit production costs. And second because they are often paid for by insurance or a public program to bring people with disabilities to the workplace. It's a bargain for insurance to buy a keyboard for 1000$ and enable a person to do their job, instead of paying for decades of sick leave. reply",

          "text": "The best solution for me was to type with the left hand and switch from a mouse to a Logitech MX Ergo thumb-trackball — the key advantage is it can sit inside the sling and instantly give me full functionality. My use case was shoulder surgery that kept my dominant right hand in a sling for two+ months, but I could use my fingers after a week or so, and much of my work is CAD. It took only a few hours to completely get used to it, and I never went back to a mouse. While left-hand-only typing speed obviously went down, this was significantly mitigated by having a full function point-&-click device. It turns out this setup is also really helpful when working in tight spaces where a mouse is near-impossible, such as airplanes or tight luncheon booths. Even typing emails and multi-page documents left-handed was tolerable for 10 weeks, but if it had been longer, I probably would have looked into a chorded one-handed keyboard solution, as the learning cost would have been worth it. I hope this helps, and good on you for helping your friend, and I hope they get well fast! reply",

Dasher is fantastic, because it's based on rock solid information theory, designed by the late David MacKay. Here is the seminal Google Tech Talk about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpOxbesRNBc Here is a demo of using Dasher by an engineer at Google, Ada Majorek, who has ALS and uses Dasher and a Headmouse to program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ Another one of her demonstrating Dasher: Ada Majorek Introduction - CSUN Dasher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsSrClBwPM Here’s a more recent presentation about it, that tells all about the latest open source release of Dasher 5: Dasher - CSUN 2016 - Ada Majorek and Raquel Romano https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFlkM_e-sDg Here's the github repo: Dasher Version 4.11 https://github.com/GNOME/dasher >Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing high rates of text entry. Ada referred me to this mind bending prototype: D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 >( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) - a really neat way to \"dive\" through a menu hierarchy/, or through recursively nested options (to build words, letter by letter, swiftly). D@sher takes Dasher, and gives it a twist, making slightly better use of screen revenue. >It also \"learns\" your typical useage, making more frequently selected options larger than sibling options. This makes it faster to use, each time you use it. >More information here: http://beznesstime.blogspot.com and here: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=960 Dasher is even a viable way to input text in VR, just by pointing your head, without a special input device! Text Input with Oculus Rift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQgluUwV2U >As part of VR development environment I'm currently writing ( https://github.com/xanxys/construct ), I've implemented dasher ( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) to input text. One important property of Dasher is that you can pre-train it on a corpus of typical text, and dynamically train it while you use it. It learns the patterns of letters and words you use often, and those become bigger and bigger targets that string together so you can select them even more quickly! Ada Majorek has it configured to toggle between English and her native language so she can switch between writing email to her family abroad and co-workers at google. Now think of what you could do with a version of dasher integrated with a programmer's IDE, that knew the syntax of the programming language you're using, as well as the names of all the variables and functions in scope, plus how often they're used! I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins...

          "text": "You're proving exactly why I posted what I did. Nobody else has the time to watch a couple of 45 minute videos (several hours actually), so I took the time to do that myself (several more videos about Dasher than those, in fact), and summarize them for you. I've had email discussions about Dasher with people I mentioned like Ada Majorek (Google), also David Ward (Inference, who worked with the late David MacKay), Tom Doellstorff (UC Irvine), Donna Z. Davis (University of Oregon), and I've read several papers about it, and also the open source code on github, to understand how it works. So I took the time to summarize the points in the videos, the email discussions I've had, the papers I read, and source code I reviewed. https://www.inference.org.uk/djw30/ There are many interesting points and ideas I've tried to gather together and summarize, and I think Dasher is an important, underrated, not widely known piece of work, that can deeply improve many people's lives, which more people should know about. Not just people with a wide range of disabilities, but fully abled people without free time on their hands who frequently need to input lots of text quickly. That's why accessibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion are so important: they help everyone. Dasher a wonderful open source project to contribute to, and a solid foundation that needs to be brought up-to-date and re-implement it in terms of modern LLMs, AI assisted IDEs like Cursor, mobile, and VR/AR user interfaces. I don't have time to do all of that myself, but I hope to save other people time and effort by writing about it, and I hope to inspire students, researchers, software developers, hackers, and therapists who do have the time, interest, friends, loved ones, patients, and customers who could benefit from it. I'm sorry to hear about your disabilities of poor reading comprehension and trouble parsing text, and I'm envious that you have so much free time and nothing better to do, that you can take time to complain about your impatience with and intolerance of my writing. But it would have been easier, more efficient, and less stressful for you to simply ignore things you're not interested in rather than unconstructively whining with off-topic posts that benefit nobody. Obviously you don't appreciate how lucky you are to be able to type such a useless post so easily. I'm not even asking you to be empathic, or give a shit about anyone but yourself: if you're lucky enough to live long enough, you'll need accessibility tools like Dasher too. If you'd like to redeem yourself by writing a more useful constructive response to my post, then go right ahead, read my previous posts, watch all the videos, read all the papers and source code yourself, have some email discussions with other people using and working on Dasher, and then try to write a better summary, because your abstract summary above has absolutely no useful information, and isn't relevant to the discussion -- just a waste of your time and everyone else's. Or you could even take the trivial effort to paste my write-up into ChatGPT and post a summary, but that would be much lower quality and less enlightening than actually watching the videos and reading the articles and source code I cited yourself, but still better and more interesting than your current bitter off-topic \"contribution\" to the discussion. If it makes you feel better, I've written every word of this post personally just for you, MyPasswordSucks. No copying or pasting whatsoever (except the email at the end, with updated links to archive.org since my web site is offline, and I reformatted the transcript of Ada's video). Are you satisfied? Is that the attention you crave? Are my syntax and semantics comprehensible to you now? In return, what do you have to contribute to this discussion yourself, besides whining and criticizing form instead of substance? At least aaron695's rightfully flagged dead sibling comment unsuccessfully and incoherently attempted to criticize dasher itself, not just the messenger, so it was at least more on topic than you post. I hope you can do better. Here's the email I sent and the response that Ada Majorek wrote to me, using Dasher and headmouse. Since she was so swamped with work at Google, and it took her so much time and effort, even with Dasher, for her to reply to my email because she has ALS, I cherish her helpful reply, and I am glad you reminded me to share it, even if it annoys you to read so much thoughtful meticulously written text that she took the precious time out of her challenging life to write to me: ---- Hello! I’ve been a huge fan of Dasher for years! I'm sad to hear that David MacKay passed away. I knew of his work on Dasher, but am just discovering his great work on global warming. I’m happy to discover how Ada Majorek is carrying on his work, and that Dasher version 5 has been released! I developed and evaluated pie menus in the late 80’s and have used them in various games and applications, and more recently I’ve been doing mobile and VR programming with Unity3D. I’m interested in helping develop versions of Dasher on other platforms, especially Unity, and specifically for head mounted displays. Is anyone else working on that, with whom I could collaborate? I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins... I’d be delighted to discuss Dasher and aQuery with anyone who’s interested! Here’s some discussion on hacker news, to which I contributed some comments about Dasher: A History of Palm, Part 1: Before the PalmPilot (lowendmac.com) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12306377 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12310029 -Don ---- Hi Don, I will write more soon. I was swamped with work last week. First, I am very happy to see your interest in Dasher.\nI don't have enough time to research another platform. I will be happy to give you walk through the code, and you can decide, if adding Unity is feasible. Is it possible to interface with C++ code on Uniy? There is Dasher Core. It is platform independent. And \"all\" you need to do is to extend several classes. Implementing it in Java Script is an interesting idea. You are second person suggesting it. Again, I will not have time to do it. But would gladly answer any questions. When you wrote about radial menus, I immediately thought of this prototype. Have you seen it before? D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 I better send half of the email now, than full email never ;-) Written with Dasher and Headmouse. :-) Ada ---- Thank you for your quick reply — I’m delighted to hear from you! Yes, it’s possible to interface native C++ code with Unity. It would also be possible to translate the C++ code to C#, which is a similar language (just cleaner and more modern). It’s also possible to compile C++ into JavaScript, but that makes it considerably harder to integrate with normal JavaScript code, so it might also be worth considering translating the C++ code to JavaScript by hand, to make it more efficient and better integrated with the browser. That adaptive hierarchical radial menu is wonderful! Thank you for linking me to that. I’ll contact the author and brainstorm ideas! That reminds me of a weird experiment I tried years ago: Here is a “precision pie menu” that I made for the NeWS window system, which lets you precisely select an angle by poking out of the circle and precisely dialing in an exact number with a flexible floppy line. I’ve never used it for anything practical, but it was a fun experiment! Precision Pie Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0scs59va4c Experiments like that are useful vehicles for exploring possibilities and generating new ideas, even if they aren’t directly useful themselves. You just can’t get very far by doing though experiments alone — you need to play with a working prototype and actually feel how it works, in order to decide how to improve it or design something different. It’s so cool you’re using Dasher and a Headmouse for everyday work, and that gives you so much experience and insight into how to use it best and make it better. So please don’t hesitate to send me half emails and half baked ideas, even if you don’t have the time to finish them! -Don ---- Ada Majorek on Dasher: [I reformatted her inspiring transcript, for people who don't have time to watch the three minute video, although it's well worth it to see how Dasher works.] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ ALS robbed me from ability to speak and ability to use computer keyboard. Thanks to Dasher I am still able to communicate at reasonable speed. Hi, my name is Ada. I want to talk about why I like Dasher. Since my ALS diagnosis in 2013 I tried countless number of alternative text entry and speech generation methods. So far Dasher is the fastest and least tiring. Dasher supports multiple languages. Very important for me, since I switch between English and Polish many times per day. I really like geeky origin of Dasher. It started as a visualization of arithmetic coding algorithm. Unfortunately at the time Dasher was not actively maintained. I was a software engineer in desperate need for a fast alternative communication tool. Dasher was an open-source project. I decided to start coding. With help of my friends and support of Google, we added many features making Dasher even better suited for alternative means of communication. And here we are today after almost 6 years of silence we are releasing a new version of Dasher: Dasher 5.00. If you know people with motor impairments or therapists, please let them know. They will like new features we have added. If you know programming, consider contributing to this very valuable project. And last but not least, if you worked on Dasher in the past, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. reply",

It's amusing just how wrong they are, but insulting and offensive to most people, so please set showdead=true if you want to see it.

Trump mocks reporter with disability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX9reO3QnUA >Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for mocking a New York Times reporter that suffers from a chronic condition.  CNN's John Berman reports Here's a low-effort ChatGPT generated TL;DR summary, to satisfy MyPasswordSucks who had trouble reading my other post: Here’s the straight-up rundown of the Dasher thread: DonHopkins jumped in to rave about Dasher—calling it a miracle for people who can’t type. He dropped links to videos, papers, GitHub, and even shared his personal emails with Ada Majorek, who uses Dasher because ALS stole her voice and hands. He made it clear he’d dug deep—watched hours of videos, pored over source code, talked to experts. He went all in to explain why Dasher deserves more love: it’s based on solid info theory, it learns your patterns, it’s openly extensible, and it works across languages and platforms—even VR. Someone named novosel chimed in asking why Don’s comment was downvoted, saying Dasher really is worth knowing. But then MyPasswordSucks blasted it as “barely-parsable copy-paste diarrhea” and declared Dasher awful, claiming the whole thing was off-topic. He sneered at Don’s effort, calling it useless. aaron695 piled on, arguing Dasher isn’t the answer for someone with a short-term injury and criticizing Don’s wall of text even more harshly. DonHopkins didn’t back down. He defended his post, pointed out how much final work he put in—no copying or pasting. He reminded people Ada had replied personally, highlighting how essential Dasher is for her. He got indignant about people whining instead of appreciating the depth of his write-up. In short, DonHopkins delivered a massive, heartfelt case for Dasher. Critics flamed him for style and focus. The result: a messy, heated debate between someone who’s poured years into accessibility work and anonymous commenters who can’t be bothered to look beyond a giant block of text. reply",

So it was basically, buy these capacitors, replace them, and off you go. Repair usually just requires basic soldering skills and the ability to put things back together you took apart. When the problem is not exactly the same, I'm just lost. There is not a lot of diagnosis videos on YouTube. All the videos are: \"1. I observed this problem. 2. [???] 3. I'll walk you through soldering on the new components.\" skipping the most important step 2. Same for car repair videos: \"I see Problem X happening. Problem X usually means component Y has failed. Here's how to replace component Y. The end.\" If that doesn't work, you wasted money on the part and your time ripping apart your car and putting it back together. reply",

          "text": "I repair practically anything that breaks in my house -- except heavy work on the car, or the roof. A few things, from me as a kid: 1. Take things apart, and try to figure out how they work. Don't worry too much about getting them back together. But then, trying to reassemble it is good practice too. There's plenty of old electronic junk that you can explore before throwing it away. Build a mental catalog of how things work and are assembled. Among other things, this will help you when you need to come up with a strategy for getting some particular gadget open -- often 9/10 of the problem. 2. Like others have said, YouTube is great. People will make a video of a repair, or even just getting something open, for a few \"likes.\" Also, most of them are just normal genuine people who aren't trying to be influencers, so it's kind of culturally refreshing. Many of my successful repairs started with YouTube, such as my clothes washer and dryer, refrigerator, lawn mower. 3. Many of my most cherished tools are what I call for \"demolition,\" not electronics specific, like picks, pry bars, a slim knife that can get between things, stuff like that. Another set of cherished tools are my magnifying visor, small magnifying glass, bright flashlight, and a stereo inspection microscope that I got second-hand. 4. A lot of \"electronic\" failures are actually mechanical in nature, and you can just use your general troubleshooting rundown to figure them out. Switches, connectors, cables, etc. 5. Begin to get the hang of identifying parts, and how part numbering schemes work. It will help you in your search for spares. 6. These days I often ask my spouse for a opinion. She's a laboratory scientist, quite sharp and skeptical. I'll have a hypothesis, and she asks the one question that blows it out of the water. Good luck!

I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts.

I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder.

Anything <50V can often just be fun tinker whatever assuming you're ok with breaking whatever you're playing with, up to a certain max amperage of your power source. High amperage but low voltage can still cause some serious messups if you don't have the right fuses in place. But I get other voltages are common in Europe. reply",

A stereo that loses the right channel unless you push on the board? Broken solder joint. Visibly exploded caps? Bad caps. Some basic understanding of electricity and current flow and the high-level concepts will help, but a detailed education is more for building your own than just repairing existing mass-produced setups.

          "text": "The thing is that one needs understanding of an electrical engineer to debug circuits one wants to repair. When you have understanding you can do some voltage measurements and try to identify faulty part. There is gazillion different parts now, that wasn’t the case 2 decades ago. I know few people who repaired their washing machines just watching youtube videos. No skills and no knowledge. That’s the best error you can find - series error. All the appliances of the same manufacturer built in the 5 years will predictably fail and replacing 20 cent regulator revives the machine. There are then random faults, that need deep knowledge and hours of debugging. They’re not economically viable to repair unless the machinery is very expensive. Good example is 400€ transistor replacement in €20k Tektronix probe. Then there are things one shouldn’t touch - Tesla battery packs and open microwave ovens for example. Enough energy to kill or badly injure the unlucky hobbyists (in German): https://www.kosmo.at/tesla-akku-explodiert-mann-schwer-verle... There are enough analog electronics to repair what requires deep analog design knowledge. Music instruments and radio equipment might fall into this category. I would say, the repairs make no sense in the future that comes. With more and more electronics and programmable components the repairs are not economically viable. I am designing a motherboard with MPM54304 PMIC and a microprocessor. Both are programmed and without firmware sources and circuit diagram one will not able to recreate desired functionality. After product release I will organize workshop for my colleagues from service department and they will still come to me to discuss the repairs when some early faulty products will be send back by customers. reply",

Bob Cordell's and/or Doug Self's books on designing power amplifiers are good for a bit more \"practical theory\" (how the blocks are arranged, what goes wrong with poor design and/or a too-small budget for protection).

          "text": "This is a great suggestion. Although, I'm not sure you should start writing software by debugging code that doesn't work, or electronics by fixing something broken. I think assembling some parts to make a basic thing that works is better. So first, this book, and then find an equivalent of the 70s and 80s Radio Shack (US) or Tandy (EU) electronic breadboard and parts \"build anything electronic\" kits. Then build stuff.  Not Arduino stuff, more basic.  The things those kits suggest making.  Understand why they are the parts they are, in the wiring circuits they are. Then tweak those to \"make your own\" to see if you know what the parts are and do and how they combine. THEN start seeing if you can debug what's broken (and maybe tap into the nothing-but-YouTube suggestions here when it gets to specific things to fix, where seeing can be helpful). RadioShack/Tandy used to have a series of handbooks like the \"Getting Started in Electronics\" book but focused more narrowly on classes of things you'd want to repair with both theory (how it works) and practice (therefore what to debug).  They were blue covers and quite plain, if I recall. You don't need courses, but readable/absorbable references to theory and practice for beginner tradespersons are actually great. reply",

Get acquainted with ohms law and… Tackle series circuits, then parallel then series parallel with resistive loads only 2nd. If you’re feeling ambitious  move on to ac theory capacitors and inductors, transformers and get comfortable converting polar to cartesian and vice versa. Typically diodes and then  transistors next. Thats pretty much it for the low level. Find a book that covers this stuff and avoid maxwell and the physics approach unless at some point you want to suffer / get really deep. Also, flux. Lots of flux and alcohol to clean it up. Flux is the key to good solder joints, that and getting comfortable creating jigs. Whatever you're soldering has to remain still while the solder sets.

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

          "text": "\"common failure mode\" = 'they break in a particular way a lot' As Randy Fromm says, \"the things that work the hardest fail the most\" Examples: MLCC (multi-layer ceramic capacitors) over time will often fail short. Older devices with electrolytic capacitors (the large can-shaped things often situated by where the power input is) have a liquid electrolyte in them that evaporates (boils off?) over time. When it does, they lose their capacitance and the power supply stops being able to supply (good) power. The point being, when something stops working, check these things first. It's like if your lawnmower dies on you, don't go pulling off the head to look at the piston. Check if there's gas in the tank first. Finally, a DMM is a digital multimeter. This is your basic tool to measure voltage, current resistance, capacitance, et c.) You can't do much troubleshooting without one. Hope this helps. reply",

          "text": ">I'd wager learning the basics Very good bet. You still have to beat the odds a lot of times beyond that, since some things are just plain fubar and can't be fixed :\\ Others which can just barely be fixed often rely on equal parts luck and skill, I'm the first to admit. I like the idea of learning how to build for a bit, before migrating more seriously toward teardown & repair. A really good start is to build a few simple hobbyist kits that run on 9 volt batteries. You may just get blinking LED's or a buzzing speaker but everything is in the kit and you get the experience with individual components. You can gain a lot that way without even trying to understand theory, but one of the best ways to develop understanding is to go back to a project you have built from the ground up, and then research each of the elements that you have already been successfully working with until you reach full understanding or at least a satisfactory plateau at that point.  Simple discrete components are probably best to develop great confidence with, before trying to deeply study the internals of integrated circuit \"chips\".  It can also be a lot more meaningful when it's your own project you are learning basic theory about, or even the most advanced equations.  If you concentrate on a limited area, it sure is more within reach than learning everything you need for a degree. The main \"academic\" thing that you can not skip is constantly learning how to better read & draw schematics. You will definitely be more quickly able to \"turn something that doesn't work\" (never even was working!) into something that works if your success rate is nominal. Every project like this is helpful as long as you are continuing to learn, Once you have built a simple kit you may later want to revisit the device and construct a \"duplicate\" from entirely recycled components that you must first remove from scrap circuit boards.  If you do the math these can be some of the most affordable components :)  Also flexes your un -soldering ability.  All without electronic theory, but it's there for the asking any time you want to dig deeper. You will use all that experience to better repair things when they need it, especially the simpler problems which may not be the most abundant but it's nice to have them under control.  Gaining more intuition about electron flow in general through experience will be more rewarding through time. While escalating your abilities when your ambition moves beyond 9 volts. More care than needed will get you a lot further than less care. reply",

If one just knows, for example, that very many faults are power supply related, and knows that problems with capacitors and transistors are responsible for a lot of power supply problems, you can accomplish quite a bit. But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult. But even then, if we watch some of what the different folks on Youtube accomplish repairing smartphones, laptops, etc., we'll see that some of these guys can achieve some pretty impressive results even without fancy labs and complete schematics, etc. Not everything is repairable of course, but I don't think pursuing this path is exactly \"tilting at windmills\" either. reply",

The fundamental problem with JIRA is that it's trying to be usable for all the workflows in all companies in all the world.  It's hard to do that simply. And the problem with using it is that companies don't fix their workflow; they just try to port their existing workflow to JIRA.  The result is that all the frustrations with the workflow turn into \"frustrations with JIRA\" (on top of the frustrations that are actually due to JIRA itself). reply",

I started by developing MCU-based edge systems and their Unix-based servers.  My current work involves creation of custom Linux distributions for a variety of embedded systems, including board design, bring up, and new driver development. I have been involved with handheld IoT and backend devops longer than those reductive abbreviations have existed.  I have been committed to using open source tools and platforms for the past twenty five years, and I have worked directly to improve that ecosystem (e.g. GNU toolchain, OpenOCD, OpenEmbedded). I strongly prefer to produce open source solutions as well, but I have learned to be practical when it comes to building a business. I am looking for a fully remote position at the staff through founder level, helping to architect and build a new embedded platform in an interesting vertical.  I am interested in working with robotics, drones, 3-D printing, or other kinds of motorized and articulated systems.

I'm Maximilian Vidavsky. I am a backend dev and technical writer based in Central PA. I've been coding since I was 13, and I have a wealth of personal projects under my belt, as well as a Mitacs internship that I beat 5 other PhD candidates for. Most of my experience is with Python, and I have significant coursework in C and SQL, but I am willing to learn any language or technology for the job. My personal interests as of late include reverse engineering, making Telegram bots, and writing documentation/deep-dive articles. As I have just graduated, I am eager to get into the workforce. At my last internship, I created the world's largest diamond dissolution database, and I estimate that I have saved over $500,000 of staff time with it. I feel a bit anxious to be posting alongside such great developers as an entry-level junior, but I feel like my breadth of knowledge lets me be a useful multi-tool that can be thrown at any task. Given enough time and resources, I can solve almost any problem! reply",

I have previously worked on pricing, recommendation systems, CV & NLP classifiers, propensity models, experiment design, and A/B tests; setting up training environments in research settings and translating research code into production pipelines. I've also been involved in setting up MLOps infra - CI/CD, data preprocessing, retraining, and inference pipelines, logging, and model monitoring. Am open to fully remote positions, either in the US or UK/Europe time zones. Should I work on US time zones, I plan to relocate to align with Eastern time. reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I am Donovan Preston. I first became heavily involved with programming and open source software through the Twisted Python project. I then went on to work on the bulk of the early code for eventlet. Python asyncio is now a part of the standard library, and I like to think that these projects influenced the direction of async programming in Python. Later, I worked for Mozilla Research and then the Mozilla Services organizations. I helped with a project called dom.js (which now lives on as domino), implemented TCP and UDP apis for Firefox OS, worked on several experiments such as Firefox Screenshots (main developer at the beginning of the project) and Firefox Send (on the Android port). Finally, I worked on the port of the Firefox Sync server from Python to Rust. I gained extensive experience with ES.Next, React, TypeScript, and Rust. Now, I have a small consultancy and have worked on several Swift apps, in addition to HTML/CSS and full stack web applications. I am looking to work on a team again and in-person is preferrable, although remote is ok. reply",

          "text": "I started as a dev shop and built 2 API products based on user demand. 1 is an OCR and document extraction service [0]. We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage. Then, as far as I know, he sat back and just watched the money roll in while he automated everything else about the job. reply",

          "text": "Not making a living, but I make about $200/mo from an API that parses recipe ingredients like \"2 cups finely chopped onions\" into structured JSON.[0] I put it in maintenance mode in 2019, so it's about 99% passive income, as I spend only about an hour or two on maintenance per year. I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo. What I wish I knew: don't use RapidAPI. They charge 20%, they have a terrible interface, and they let customers run up huge charges and walk away without paying anything. I wish I'd just rolled my own simple thing with Paddle. [0] https://zestfuldata.com/ reply",

These days the operators are a bit more aware of the value of A2P (application-to-person) versus P2P which was/is very much on the decline. That also means the operators have capacity built of ready to be used without new investments. As for our own software, we are mostly a Python based shop. And we use tons of open source.

It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

It's knowlodge that will remain, who knows MCP how long will be there? Also, even if we reach 99% of the code generated by machines(and I don't believe it if not for trivial code) you'd still need deeper skills to understand it, not only semantically but looking at the big picture in terms of architecture and business/design implications. My suggestion is the contrary of many tech influencers, do not deep dive into prompt engineering or similar stuff, that's the trivial part, if you fail at prompting don't let them convince you you have a skill issue, you're not paid to chat, you're paid to solve problems, prompting is trivial, you must understand problems and requirements deeply. I actually refreshed my high school math and with it I've been able to do so much, from AI basics inner workings to computer graphics, there is so much in core knowledge that is underrated these days. I think I'll soon start the Computer Enhance course from Casey Muratori for low level stuff and performance. Since the advent of LLMs I actually wanted to learn more than before, it has been beneficial to me reply",

I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards.

The problem is that most of the public space has been poisoned with AI hype, and it's nearly impossible to find more than surface-level introductions for a lot of topics because the substandard Medium posts and YouTube hypemongers drowns them out. Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful. But for the wider internet, the hype train has forced most of the informed discourse off the road. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you.

I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive. So would you say I was banned for talking about <topic>? Or would you say I was banned for my behavior while talking about <topic>? reply",

I think LLMs will find their uses, it just takes time to distil what they are really useful for vs what the AI companies are generating hype for.

In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results.

          "text": "I completely disagree. I don't see the current status quo fundamentally changing. That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

Unless you have already spent big $$ on a GPU for gaming, I really don't think buying GPUs for home makes sense, considering the hardware and running costs, when you can go to a site like vast.ai and borrow one for an insanely cheap amount to try it out. You'll probably get bored and be glad you didn't spend your kids' college fund on a rack of H100s. reply",

          "text": "8 year old badly wants to be an engineer like his dad. :’) Public school got him into Scratch so he was animating things. The high school robotics team I mentor has Lego robotics kits for their community outreach program. Those kits use Scratch. So I got him a used kit and he spends an absolutely ridiculous amount of time making robots that do stuff. This started at a very young age: we gave him access to a windows PC, not a tablet. So by 3 he could log in and get to YouTube kids. This meant that keyboard and mouse and web browser were very comfortable concepts. We also gave him and his younger brother countless building toys. Meccano. Lego Technic. A few lessons I’d love to empart: - you can’t make your kid into this. His younger brother has no interest and is far more about sports. So we nurture that with him instead. - open ended learning. I’m not sitting down and teaching him.  All I do is make sure he has access to the tools, and I unstick him when he’s stuck. - I connect concepts when I see them. “That’s called a loop. It’s just like that thing you did in Minecraft to make your machine work over and over again.” - the learning must all be a side effect of having fun. Don’t try to teach programming. Do fun things and fill in the programming toolbox, tool by tool, as they’re needed. - connect programming to what your kid is passionate about. Programming is a means to an end, not the end itself.  My kid loves trains and has a Lego train set. I suggested he use his technic to automate the track switch. I then let him work at it for hours and hours over weeks, giving him breadcrumbs of what to consider next. reply",

          "text": "I have run a codeclub for 10 years. Here’s some quick thoughts: - Make them curious, if they are curious they will teach themselves. Example: don’t tell them what a for loop is, make a project where they really need it, but let them first to write it very verbosely without loops, then they will almost invent it themselves and be relived when you teach them (same style can be applied to most things) - make projects that have low entry level, but where they can improve it infinitely. E.g. build an aquarium simulator or a city simulator using p5.js - make them collaborate with other kids if possible, often they learn better from their peers than listening to their parents. Facilitate collaboration, and help them come up with more and more difficult projects, that require more and more of them, so they don’t stay on the same level too long reply",

          "text": "I taught kids how to code for several years, both in person and through a website that taught Python to ~500k kids. My eternal advice with teaching CS is to delay abstractions as long as possible . Teach them how to draw a circle on a canvas, then get them to move the circle to different parts of the canvas, then get them to draw multiple overlapping circles/rectangles/etc. Once you've got that down, make a bouncing ball animation, simple games, and so on. Most kids don't really care for leetcode problems these days, so it's best to stick to things that are visual, creative, and instant-feedback (i.e. games). This was a really useful realization when I was teaching kids to code in person for ~5 years. I started off teaching Java with an abstraction layer ( https://www.bluej.org/ ), but I found that many students would be intimidated by anything that ventured outside of the abstraction (e.g. just run `javac` on your computer with a `.java` file). My most successful students intuitively understood how to turn a text file on their computer into a useful piece of compiled code, or into a JAR bundle that they could share with others. They also used the various abstractions that were thoughtfully introduced over time - e.g. an IDE that gives you a run button, libraries like Firebase which enable some exciting multiplayer game options, and so on. reply",

          "text": "That's levels of abstraction, but still thinking. Just last night, while looking for clear technical information about MCP integration options for Gemini, I found this Google-written article[1], that -- with a positive, hype-compliant spin -- opens with: > Have you ever had something on the tip of your tongue, but you weren’t exactly sure how to describe what’s in your mind? > For developers, this is where \"vibe coding \" comes in. Vibe coding helps developers achieve their vision with models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate code from natural language prompts. Instead of writing every line of code, developers can now describe the desired functionality in plain language. AI translates these \"vibes\" into your vision. That's not thinking. We've even appropriated \"vibe\" terminology, which means something like emotional gut feel, without having to think about it.  (Mostly associated with wake-and-bake stoners, who've self-imposed two-digit IQs and munchies, and who will sometimes speak in terms of \"vibes\", for lack of further analytic capacity.) Recognizing that the top killer app for \"AI\" right now is cheating on homework, the collaborate-with-AI 'skill' is like the well-known collaborate-with-lab-partner.  The lab partner who does all the work, while the slacking student learns nothing, and therefore the slacker fails the exam.  (But, near-term, the slacker might scrape by with a C- for the class, due to copying the lab portion, and due to an instructor who now just wants to be rid of the hopeless student.)

This isn't really some new concept, the only thing new is that it's being applied to areas that haven't historically had a ton of automation. Hand-wringing about LLMs and \"not thinking\" is the same thing that was hand-wrung about students using calculators and not knowing how to do long division. Or using a computer lookup and not knowing how to use the dewey decimal system. Heck, or using an automobile/bicycle and not knowing how to shoe a horse. People over the last decade have demonstrated they are perfectly capable of generating large quantities of crappy, not-thought-out code all on their own. Just look around you. LLMs democratize the lowest common denominator, and those that are doing sufficiently difficult, nuanced, unique things that they actually need to know what they're doing, will continue to do so. I don't think LLMs will reduce the abilities of the 10% best software engineers, and I don't think the quality of output of the rest will meaningfully change. reply",

And when they can't independently invent a concept or technique that they need for something they're building, you can nudge them.  (Example: Their 2D video game screen refreshes are too slow, and now they would be excited to be introduced to double-buffering.  And now they'll know exactly why they need it and how it works.  So, the next time they need a related graphics improvement, they've had that prior learning experience, and might be able to figure it out on their own.)

The environment today is way more complex, and it's a lot harder to be proud of little things when you see people crowing about how they \"wrote this little app over the weekend\" and it's already polished and full of features. I remember being proud of my little unit converter that ran on the command line, and even more proud when I got an actual window to show up on a screen (GUI programming took a long time to get into). These days, those things just aren't special enough to keep them engaged. I don't know if it's just too commonplace now, or too complicated to get started, but it doesn't feel the same as it once did. My kids have finally gotten hooked by godot, after a few years of building up a foundation with simple programming assignments.

It is a task done by someone who can manage different technical, creative and business types. I think kids want to have ideas. This creativity can be captured by coding, maybe, but maybe there are better outlets for the individual. The director of street fighter 5, for example, started as a music composer. I think it's important to really understand our kids. They may not have the experience or vocabulary to have this discussion. Wanting to make a game and coding are different things. You're on the right path in terms of breaking things down into smaller, solvable problems. Coding might be part of it, but translatable skills to making a game might also include leading a band, making a short film, playing team sports, etc. reply",

Just my two cents: if your kids aren't very interested or ready for that kind of knowledge now, you might find that in a few years they can learn it surprisingly quickly if they're interested then.

          "text": "It's important to remember that the exercise of teaching children coding isn't so much about teaching them how to code, but how to think, how to plan, predict, conjecture, reason and so forth. It's just a convenient and quicker way of teaching these things than the alternatives. If they have a good foundation in these things, then if they choose to go on to coding later they can learn all of the minutiae. But I've found in teaching it is important to stress that learning basic coding is _not_ about steering them towards coding as a career, or even a pursuit. It _is_ important to stress that learning basic coding will help them become better problem solvers, better able to anticipate issues and mitigate them. And that this is useful to them in a wide variety of areas in which they may have interest, such as sports, engineering, adventuring etc. And yes, also learning how to guide an LLM. So once you get those fundamentals down in the context of coding (Scratch, GameMaker, Logo, BASIC are all fine here), go practice them in more real-world applications. Those are the skills you need to foster, not object-oriented programming. And if they take an interest in going further with coding, then that's fine. They will have the tools they need to do that. reply",

          "text": "I have 3 kids, all around the same age (K/1). They all got laptops about 18 months ago for christmas. I installed mint linux on all of them, and installed a few free/libre games for them to play, and I self-host the game server at home. One game they play is luanti (formerly minetest). I gave them instructions on how to clone the git repository for the game, run the build script, and then start the game. They've probably forgotten the build instructions, but they know to play, they have to type `cd code/minetest` and then `bin/luanti`. Occasionally they have to run `git pull` to update the code on their computers. I handle all the game server administration. I initially blocked all internet access with a kill switch, but this quickly became an issue because you need to be able to run `apt update` and a few other commands to keep the system up to date. So now I run a proxy server called e2guardian that lets them access sites that I choose. Later, I introduced them to scratch, and I downloaded the entirely of griffpatch's youtube library with yt-dlp and organized it into folders on each of  their computers. I've done the same thing with other tutorial style videos. They don't have access to youtube, and I don't really think it makes sense to give them access at this age. They run scratch locally, as opposed to using scratch.mit.edu. I enabled the scratch website for a couple of days as a treat for them, and as expected, they spent most of the time exploring and playing others' games, but very little time building their own. I sort of expected this to happen, so we closed off access a few days later, and they took some of the ideas they saw online and started playing with them locally. So my experience is: a) linux makes a great platform for kids, since it's very easy to tweak things to stop behaviors that you don't want to reinforce. e.g. `sudo chmod 400 /usr/local/games` turns off all the games, `sudo killall kidname` will close the desktop session if your kid isn't listening when it's time for bed, you can set up time-based login policies with pam_time, you can install your own root certificates for SSL MITM, etc. b) games reinforce that \"computers are fun\", and games like luanti are free, open-source, and hackable. c) interest in games naturally spills over into interest in making your own games. If you want to try luanti/minetest, I recently cleaned up/released a mod that I built for the kids last year called turtlebots. It's a visual programming tool that lets you program little turtle-shaped robots that can navigate in a minecraft-style world and build things as they move around.
