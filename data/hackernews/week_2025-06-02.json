I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

I'm a customer-facing technical leader with 10+ years in tech and a track record of building customer experience functions from scratch. Most recently, I was the first customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24), a startup building an AI software engineer. I owned everything outside of engineering: support, developer relations / developer advocate, docs, YouTube demos, influencer outreach, blog posts, and building + open-sourcing demo apps. Before that, I was the first remote hire at Streak (YC S11) and spent several years owning customer onboarding, support, and automation. I also learned to code on the side, eventually completing the Capstone program at Launch School. I’m especially strong in early-stage chaos, where startups need someone who can do a bit of everything, talk to users, squash bugs, clean up docs, spin up demo apps, handle a support queue, write content, and generally make the founders’ lives easier. I’m looking for a startup where I can either be the first customer engineer or support leader, or join a small team as a DevRel/Community Engineer and help ship content + build trust with technical users. What I’m best at: * Translating user feedback into roadmap clarity * Turning vague “customer needs” into structured, scalable systems * Writing fast, clear docs + building content users actually read * Jumping into startup Discords and building real community * Owning support and success systems without needing hand-holding reply",

CV: Available on Request Email: ineedanengineer@outlook.com I bring your solutions to life. An Engineer of many hats, I solve your problems and bring them into the world. I’ve built entire systems from the ground up, delivered physical products in a matter of weeks, and kept Oil Rigs working offshore, built departments filled with the best people to produce top results and make the wonderful dreams reality. With a background in Electro Mechanical Engineering, I’ve designed products for the consumer, offshore, military markets, so I know what good hardware looks like. I’ve built prototypes for many markets, and architected complex systems from concept to retirement, in a complete cradle to grave manner. I’ve worked closely with software teams to guide development of new features to protect marine vessels from GPS jamming, developed APIs for integration and dug through code by hand to reverse engineer old products that haven’t been touched in decades to determine their operation and how they will be supported and upgraded to turn them into the feature they should be. As an Engineering Manager, I’ve been the driving force behind teams. I build teams based on two key ideas - is the team one full of individuals that are valued for their expertise, and is the culture one that I would like to be a part of? I make it a matter of pride that everyone should feel like an integral part of the team, and that mentality comes from the top down. I’ve worked with remotely distributed teams across many different disciplines, all working towards the end goal without ego getting in the way. My job has always been simple as the EM, give the team the tools and trust they need to do their absolute best. Your idea is your baby, it’s precious to you. I’ve worked at startups, small companies and mega corporations and I’ve always maintained a very simple philosophy when it comes to work - “are we doing what the customer needs with the best people we can get?” I’m your mechanical engineer, engineering manager, product manager, systems engineer, R&D specialist, market analyst and head of technology in one, and I’m ready to make your dream the product it needs to be, hardware or software. reply",

          "text": "I started as a dev shop and built 2 API products based on user demand. 1 is an OCR and document extraction service [0]. We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage.

I guess check your employment contracts and whatnot, but it's very common for people to leave a company and start consulting and/or freelancing in the expertise they gained at that company. And it's not too uncommon for former employers to be one of their first clients or get your first clients from relationships associated with your former employer. All of this assumes you don't burn bridges and have the interpersonal skills, in-demand expertise, luck, timing, and interest in building out a small service-based business. reply",

I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo. What I wish I knew: don't use RapidAPI. They charge 20%, they have a terrible interface, and they let customers run up huge charges and walk away without paying anything.

I don't fully understand this statement. the economic player with direct contact to the customer \"owns\" the customer and has a lot of power in negotiation with suppliers. the customer-facing players have the most information about their customers, and can offer adjacent products (want fries with that?) Uber and Lyft make big money, not their drivers. Amazon and Ebay make big money, not their sellers. McDonalds makes more money than their food suppliers, and franchisees. The exception is with something like intellectual property, let's use movies as an example. The owners of the content want to sell it widely and will do a variety of distribution deals for different distribution channels. However, if any distribution channel starts taking a big slice of the money pie, the terms of the contract renewal will be changed because without the content they are dead. reply",

ImageMagick is an open source tool for resizing images etc. But some people successfully build API services or SaaS-services on top of it. It works because people AND businesses pay for convenience. What space do you have knowledge of? What pains do people have in that domain that can be solved with tech? Always start with the problem.

When we launched 3 years ago our differentiator was that we could train both cheaper and faster by running on TPUs, these days GPUs have mostly caught up, and open source models are not as competitive as they once were. It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

          "text": "8 year old badly wants to be an engineer like his dad. :’) Public school got him into Scratch so he was animating things. The high school robotics team I mentor has Lego robotics kits for their community outreach program. Those kits use Scratch. So I got him a used kit and he spends an absolutely ridiculous amount of time making robots that do stuff. This started at a very young age: we gave him access to a windows PC, not a tablet. So by 3 he could log in and get to YouTube kids. This meant that keyboard and mouse and web browser were very comfortable concepts. We also gave him and his younger brother countless building toys. Meccano. Lego Technic. A few lessons I’d love to empart: - you can’t make your kid into this. His younger brother has no interest and is far more about sports. So we nurture that with him instead. - open ended learning. I’m not sitting down and teaching him.  All I do is make sure he has access to the tools, and I unstick him when he’s stuck. - I connect concepts when I see them. “That’s called a loop. It’s just like that thing you did in Minecraft to make your machine work over and over again.” - the learning must all be a side effect of having fun. Don’t try to teach programming. Do fun things and fill in the programming toolbox, tool by tool, as they’re needed. - connect programming to what your kid is passionate about. Programming is a means to an end, not the end itself.  My kid loves trains and has a Lego train set. I suggested he use his technic to automate the track switch. I then let him work at it for hours and hours over weeks, giving him breadcrumbs of what to consider next. reply",

Example: don’t tell them what a for loop is, make a project where they really need it, but let them first to write it very verbosely without loops, then they will almost invent it themselves and be relived when you teach them (same style can be applied to most things) - make projects that have low entry level, but where they can improve it infinitely. E.g. build an aquarium simulator or a city simulator using p5.js - make them collaborate with other kids if possible, often they learn better from their peers than listening to their parents. Facilitate collaboration, and help them come up with more and more difficult projects, that require more and more of them, so they don’t stay on the same level too long reply",

          "text": "I taught kids how to code for several years, both in person and through a website that taught Python to ~500k kids. My eternal advice with teaching CS is to delay abstractions as long as possible . Teach them how to draw a circle on a canvas, then get them to move the circle to different parts of the canvas, then get them to draw multiple overlapping circles/rectangles/etc. Once you've got that down, make a bouncing ball animation, simple games, and so on. Most kids don't really care for leetcode problems these days, so it's best to stick to things that are visual, creative, and instant-feedback (i.e. games). This was a really useful realization when I was teaching kids to code in person for ~5 years. I started off teaching Java with an abstraction layer ( https://www.bluej.org/ ), but I found that many students would be intimidated by anything that ventured outside of the abstraction (e.g. just run `javac` on your computer with a `.java` file). My most successful students intuitively understood how to turn a text file on their computer into a useful piece of compiled code, or into a JAR bundle that they could share with others. They also used the various abstractions that were thoughtfully introduced over time - e.g. an IDE that gives you a run button, libraries like Firebase which enable some exciting multiplayer game options, and so on. reply",

Vibe coding helps developers achieve their vision with models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate code from natural language prompts. Instead of writing every line of code, developers can now describe the desired functionality in plain language. AI translates these \"vibes\" into your vision. That's not thinking. We've even appropriated \"vibe\" terminology, which means something like emotional gut feel, without having to think about it.  (Mostly associated with wake-and-bake stoners, who've self-imposed two-digit IQs and munchies, and who will sometimes speak in terms of \"vibes\", for lack of further analytic capacity.) Recognizing that the top killer app for \"AI\" right now is cheating on homework, the collaborate-with-AI 'skill' is like the well-known collaborate-with-lab-partner.  The lab partner who does all the work, while the slacking student learns nothing, and therefore the slacker fails the exam.  (But, near-term, the slacker might scrape by with a C- for the class, due to copying the lab portion, and due to an instructor who now just wants to be rid of the hopeless student.)

I want kids to learn by figuring out things as they're building something that they want to build. And when they can't independently invent a concept or technique that they need for something they're building, you can nudge them.  (Example: Their 2D video game screen refreshes are too slow, and now they would be excited to be introduced to double-buffering.  And now they'll know exactly why they need it and how it works.  So, the next time they need a related graphics improvement, they've had that prior learning experience, and might be able to figure it out on their own.) Imagine if young Carmack had been plopped down in front of a vibe coding session for Unity or Unreal, stated what he wanted, and it emitted yet another generic 3D first-person shooter.  Would he have ever been motivated to innovate anything, and if he was, would he have the cognitive strength and learning skill to do so? reply",

This creativity can be captured by coding, maybe, but maybe there are better outlets for the individual. The director of street fighter 5, for example, started as a music composer. I think it's important to really understand our kids. They may not have the experience or vocabulary to have this discussion. Wanting to make a game and coding are different things. You're on the right path in terms of breaking things down into smaller, solvable problems.

Problem decomposition - Given The previous how can I chunk the overall space of action into measurable and manageable parts to solve 4. Tool selection - what effector systems can I access and can they solve the subproblems? 5. Structured solution exploration - Now that I know my goal, context, problem heirarchy and tools, how do I create experimental system to progressively solve each subproblem and the intersection between them Then it’s just running that until you have a solution This transcends “coding” to more important thing which is holistic alignment of goal (direction) and action capabilities (magnitude) that results in a measured action vector which is discrete and bounded. reply",

Mostly my goal was to make him motivated to learn (showing him interesting projects I had been working on, etc.). From my experience with motivation and time the skills will come themselves, without motivation, every attempt is pointless.

Focusing on CS fundamentals isn't always worthwhile, unless there's a genuine interest in computer science or math olympiad style problems.

Just my two cents: if your kids aren't very interested or ready for that kind of knowledge now, you might find that in a few years they can learn it surprisingly quickly if they're interested then.

          "text": "I have 3 kids, all around the same age (K/1). They all got laptops about 18 months ago for christmas. I installed mint linux on all of them, and installed a few free/libre games for them to play, and I self-host the game server at home. One game they play is luanti (formerly minetest). I gave them instructions on how to clone the git repository for the game, run the build script, and then start the game. They've probably forgotten the build instructions, but they know to play, they have to type `cd code/minetest` and then `bin/luanti`. Occasionally they have to run `git pull` to update the code on their computers. I handle all the game server administration. I initially blocked all internet access with a kill switch, but this quickly became an issue because you need to be able to run `apt update` and a few other commands to keep the system up to date. So now I run a proxy server called e2guardian that lets them access sites that I choose. Later, I introduced them to scratch, and I downloaded the entirely of griffpatch's youtube library with yt-dlp and organized it into folders on each of  their computers. I've done the same thing with other tutorial style videos. They don't have access to youtube, and I don't really think it makes sense to give them access at this age. They run scratch locally, as opposed to using scratch.mit.edu. I enabled the scratch website for a couple of days as a treat for them, and as expected, they spent most of the time exploring and playing others' games, but very little time building their own. I sort of expected this to happen, so we closed off access a few days later, and they took some of the ideas they saw online and started playing with them locally. So my experience is: a) linux makes a great platform for kids, since it's very easy to tweak things to stop behaviors that you don't want to reinforce. e.g. `sudo chmod 400 /usr/local/games` turns off all the games, `sudo killall kidname` will close the desktop session if your kid isn't listening when it's time for bed, you can set up time-based login policies with pam_time, you can install your own root certificates for SSL MITM, etc. b) games reinforce that \"computers are fun\", and games like luanti are free, open-source, and hackable. c) interest in games naturally spills over into interest in making your own games. If you want to try luanti/minetest, I recently cleaned up/released a mod that I built for the kids last year called turtlebots. It's a visual programming tool that lets you program little turtle-shaped robots that can navigate in a minecraft-style world and build things as they move around.

          "text": "It's important to remember that the exercise of teaching children coding isn't so much about teaching them how to code, but how to think, how to plan, predict, conjecture, reason and so forth. It's just a convenient and quicker way of teaching these things than the alternatives. If they have a good foundation in these things, then if they choose to go on to coding later they can learn all of the minutiae. But I've found in teaching it is important to stress that learning basic coding is _not_ about steering them towards coding as a career, or even a pursuit. It _is_ important to stress that learning basic coding will help them become better problem solvers, better able to anticipate issues and mitigate them. And that this is useful to them in a wide variety of areas in which they may have interest, such as sports, engineering, adventuring etc. And yes, also learning how to guide an LLM. So once you get those fundamentals down in the context of coding (Scratch, GameMaker, Logo, BASIC are all fine here), go practice them in more real-world applications. Those are the skills you need to foster, not object-oriented programming. And if they take an interest in going further with coding, then that's fine. They will have the tools they need to do that. reply",

The delta-epsilon definition of a limit was what really kick-started my interest in mathematics, but it was also so brutal to wrap my head around. I would say the concept of a group is another one for a lot of people. Abstract algebra is sometimes the first time you take a math class in undergrad where all references to numbers are very far away, and you have to accept that the definition of a group contains vast and untold multitudes beyond its straightforward definition. When it \"clicked\" for me, however, everything else in that class started flowing much better. Gauge invariance in mathematical physics might be another good one, but that's a lot more niche in who actually learns it. Lyapunov stability from dynamical systems is something I'd point out as actually the opposite of this - it makes a lot of sense very quickly and helps make light of quite a few things you see in the dynamical systems course material leading up to it. reply",

The Gemini protocol doesn't really offer what the old web was all about because it doesn't allow the author the degree of freedom and creativity that the old web did. It was designed under the premise that the \"web\" should only be a strictly textual data format with only links to other documents and that styling and layout should be extremely minimal and entirely controlled by the client. Which is not what the old web was, either technically or in spirit. It's what some people believe the old web should have been. As such it can only appeal to a subset of even technical people, and it's probably reached its saturation point by now. reply",

I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards.

Something that is more accurate but put in a boring way will often be downvoted, while straight up incorrect but funny/emotional/\"fitting the group think\" comments usually get upvoted. For us who've spent a lot of time on the web, this sort of bullshit detector is basically built-in at this point, but if you're new to places where the group think is so heavy as on reddit, it's worth being careful taking anything at face value. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

          "text": "This is of course true is some cases and less true in others. I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you.

I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive.

The problem is that most of the public space has been poisoned with AI hype, and it's nearly impossible to find more than surface-level introductions for a lot of topics because the substandard Medium posts and YouTube hypemongers drowns them out. Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful. But for the wider internet, the hype train has forced most of the informed discourse off the road. reply",

I think LLMs will find their uses, it just takes time to distil what they are really useful for vs what the AI companies are generating hype for.

          "text": "> The number of quantized bits is a trade off between size and quality. Ideally you should be aiming for a 6-bit or 5-bit model. I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

          "text": "I completely disagree. I don't see the current status quo fundamentally changing. That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

At least that particular concern isn’t the ball mover people’s comments here would make you think it is.

Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results.

I upgraded the WiFi to an Intel AX210 6e for about another $10 off Amazon. It gets 6-8 hours of battery life doing browsing and texting editing kind of workloads. The only thing that is itching me to get a new machine is it needs a 19V power supply. Luckily it's a pretty common barrel size, I already had several power cables laying around that work just fine.

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

Unless you have already spent big $$ on a GPU for gaming, I really don't think buying GPUs for home makes sense, considering the hardware and running costs, when you can go to a site like vast.ai and borrow one for an insanely cheap amount to try it out.

          "text": "I can think of a few reasons. 1. What you said about matching the way you think and your personal style. 2. Longevity. If you use someone else’s peoject, it’s dependent on them maintaining it. Assuming you don’t want to take it over at some point, making your own thing means you know how it all works so you can fix/maintain it if needed, and build it in a way that requires as little or as much maintenance as you want. 3. Building the tools is more fun than what you will ultimately do with it. I find the idea of writing my own site building compelling. Based on how many blogs I’ve started and never wrote in regularly, I don’t actually find the act of blogging compelling. People who have something to say and want an easy way to get the message out just pick a tool and stick with it. Others like myself, will build platforms to say things, then never actually say anything. I just build blogs from scratch over and over again, because it’s an easy, but semi interesting project that can be solved in countless ways. This could be called procrastination, but I think it’s something else, as I’m not actually trying that hard to have a blog or a site with traffic that people care about and visit. It’s just for me. reply",

There is a psychological measure for this called uncertainty avoidance . As for myself I have learned to avoid certain things that only induce complexity and as result feel confident I can build almost anything in JavaScript/TypeScript. Here are my zones of avoidance. * DOM abstraction. Working with the DOM is stupid simple, so don’t use unnecessary abstractions to make it something it isn’t. Sometimes I do find the DOM is missing important features so I will extend the DOMs API with original methods, such as getNodesByType. * No OOP. I avoid classes and inheritance as entirely unnecessary. Functions and objects are all I need for architecture. * Know your platform. In the browser it’s the DOM and Web APIs. In Node it’s their direct module APIs. Get comfortable working as close to the platform as possible. It’s less to troubleshoot later. * Avoid unnecessary string parsing. This includes things like querySelectors, innerHTML, and a lot of insanity from framework template systems. This is by far one of the two biggest performance boosts. * Preference WebSockets over HTTP. This also dramatically boosts performance and significantly reduces application complexity. reply",

          "text": "People love their craft and want to really understand how a tool works. They might start with taking a tool apart, looking at how it works, putting it back together and then using it for a bit.  Then they need a similar tool for a slightly different use case, so they start making one themselves. Maybe they have more specific, detailed needs than existing tools. Maybe there is something about the tool that annoys them or they think they could make it work better. This keeps going over time. > This was the craftsman’s ‘Golden Age’ and much time and trouble was taken over the design of tools. Craftsmen were being called upon to do more skilful and exacting work and the use of tools and the interest in development had become very widespread. Above pulled from A Brief History of the Woodworking Plane [0]. A woodworking tool that has evolved over 2,000 years. Now there are electric planers, handheld electric planers and lots of heavy machinery that do the same thing in a very automated way. If a company is mass producing kitchen cabinets, they aren't hand planing edges on boards, a machine is doing all that work. I feel like with AI we are on the cusp of moving beyond a \"Golden age\" and into an \"industrial age\" for coding, where it will become more important to have code that AI understands vs. something that is carefully crafted. Simple business pressure will demand it (whether we like it or not). The difference with hand planes (and other woodworking tools/concepts) is that a lot of people can appreciate a piece of furniture and the craft that went into it by opening a drawer and seeing hand cut dovetails for example.  When it comes to digital products, none of the consumers of the product will really care about the craftsman that created a JS library that they are indirectly using on a web site that has its \"view source\" hidden with minification/obfuscation.

He doesn't believe in slowly turning on things with old electrolytic capacitors, for example. I've learned quite a bit from him. I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts. (Only use 1 hand, keep the other behind you, always have a safety partner, etc) I've learned to hate Silver Mica capacitors. I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder. I'd suggest starting with something like an Arduino starter kit to get a sense of how components actually interact. But remember, if something is dead, you can't really make it worse.

If one just knows, for example, that very many faults are power supply related, and knows that problems with capacitors and transistors are responsible for a lot of power supply problems, you can accomplish quite a bit. But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult. But even then, if we watch some of what the different folks on Youtube accomplish repairing smartphones, laptops, etc., we'll see that some of these guys can achieve some pretty impressive results even without fancy labs and complete schematics, etc. Not everything is repairable of course, but I don't think pursuing this path is exactly \"tilting at windmills\" either. reply",

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

It gives me enough to know that I could be out of a job for a year without being homeless and hungry (not counting retirement assets) It means that even though we live in Florida, I can still say “let’s go to Costa Rica and Panama City for the entire winter”.  And even locally when I want to fly back to my former home for a weekend every quarter just to play cards with my friends and hang out I can or if we just want to rent an Airbnb back home for a couple of months during the summer to spend time with friends and our adult sons. When our friends suggest we get together and go on a cruise during Christmas we don’t think about it, we just say “yes”. When my younger adult son calls us and tells us he is going to be temporarily laid off during Christmas we just ask how much he needs and don’t think about it. Notice I didn’t say “buy things”.  We live in a 1200 square foot condo and everything we own besides our car can literally fit in four suitcases and we have actually traveled around the country with everything we owned in suitcases. Even the furniture in our condotel came with it and if we do sell it, it stays with it. We threw away or gave away everything but the clothes we actually wear and our electronic devices and we even downsized those.  If you can’t tell - we really hate “stuff”.  Our one car is the cheapest thing that we could buy that was the base level of comfort we could deal with. We use money for experiences, spend time with friends and family to allow my wife to pursue her passions and do her volunteer work.  Even before she retired she was able to get a lower paying job (with the benefits we needed then) working with special needs kids. reply",

We still enjoy spending on travel but we live in a high COL area, have a big mortgage, a couple of nice cars and buy too much non-essential stuff online. We do also try to give a good amount to causes we believe in and save well for retirement. I think saying \"money doesn't buy happiness\" is too reductive. The crap from Amazon certainly makes no meaningful difference and actually I feel slightly embarrassed when I see a new package arrive. But the relief from stress of having no debt, living in a good area for schools, having a large runway and not worrying about the cost of groceries is a real life improvement that I would be sad to give up. Having said that, none of the great memories from life so far involve spending huge amounts of money. reply",

But since I was old enough to actually look at paycheck (paycheque?) calculators online, I've found that the UK tax rate for livable wages is actually fairly low. To compare NYC to UK, £66k/yr = $90k/yr. In the UK, you would be taxed £17k ($23k), but that same salary living in NYC would be taxed $26k (£19k). So NYC + Fed + NYS taxed together at a higher rate than the UK government (INCLUDING NI). And $90k in NYC feels like WAY less than £66k somewhere Zone 4-6 in London with a similar commute. reply",

I offer as a counterweight to all the frugality that inevitably accrues in these sorts of threads. Sorry, Financial Independence, Retire Early folks. Read at your own risk. Judge if you will. Income is $450k / yr, engineer, 39 years old, no kids and no plans to have them. I have a chronic illness and retirement seems a distant and not very pleasant prospect. I like working and like to enjoy life. * $5k / month on rent. (Nice apartment in a high cost of living city). * At least $7k month goes into savings (I’m not totally financially irresponsible!) * One pretty ordinary car, expect to drive it for 10 yrs, usual costs. * $5k / month average on travel. My biggest luxury. I fly international business class sometimes but only when it’s “cheap”. * $2k / month on groceries, wine, dining out. I enjoy fine dining. * $3k / month on clothes and accessories. I’m a woman and I have a weakness for nice things, worst of all for designer bags. Yes I know it’s frivolous but the marginal utility is there for me. * $1k / month on a personal trainer. Could I have the same level of fitness without it? In theory yes, in practice no. The thing I wish I had more of is time, not in the sense of “retire and don’t work” but in the sense of “it would be nice to take a slight pay cut and work only 9 months of the year and travel more and spend the rest of the time reading, studying math again, and doing interesting projects.” Unfortunately that option isn’t really open to me, outside of consulting which I have no appetite for. I didn’t get into engineering for the money, but out of love. I’d have done it anyway. But the money is nice, for sure. I save some and don’t feel the need to be unnecessarily frugal with the rest. I know I’m incredibly fortunate. Your mileage may vary, and especially if you have kids. Make your own choices according to your values. reply",

Well, my hobbies could be expensive but I don't go down the road some people do. I have a wife and two kids. A decent portion of my money goes to the normal family expenses including retirement savings. Outside of that, my biggest expenses, in order-ish, are: - Concerts. My wife and I love going to see music so it's maybe $100 bucks for a concert or two per month. - Once or twice a year I'll buy myself a new guitar pedal. They tend to be higher quality ones so that will run you $300 - $400 easy. - Pokemon cards. My son got into and I got hooked. It's a deep strategy game and it's tons of fun. We probably spend ~$50 a month on this. We go to a game store to play on the weekends so we always buy a pack or two to help support the store. - The usual drugs. Alcohol. Weed. The less usual but still good drugs, mushrooms and molly (pure MDMA) a few times a year. If I had a billion dollars I would probably have things like a personal driver and chef, and maybe a few nicer guitars and some sweet-ass pokemon cards, but overall I want for nothing. As you can see, I tend to spend money on experiences instead of things. The physical things I do buy, pedals and cards, are for things I do with other people. My biggest restriction is having two kids, 4 and 7. I would love to travel more but it's not a money issue. reply",

This applies for small purchases like a tempting snack at the grocery store. Am I going to eat it? Will I really enjoy this? If so, ok. If it will sit in the cabinet and be passed over for other snacks, no. It applies to large purchases as well. Should I buy this very expensive bicycle? Yes, I will ride it. And as it turns out, I did. It’s almost 10 years old, and I still ride it a lot. I’m also regularly going through my belongings and donating, selling, and trashing things I don’t use. This helps me to learn over time and make better purchasing decisions. It also helps me reduce the amount of crap I have. Best of all it’s really nice when I can give something to someone who appreciates it much more and will make better use of it. The result is that other than the regular essential things to maintain life such as food, household goods, etc. I buy things extremely rarely. The thing I spend the most disposable income on is probably tickets to shows, sports, and other experiences. If you ask me if I’ll use them and enjoy them, the answer is almost always yes.

That said, I was pretty lucky in that I don't have debts: I got my Master's degree mostly for govt. funds due to good grades + started working in development during my 2nd year in Bachelor's. I am also pretty lucky that I don't have many expenses: I live in my dad's old city apartment and look after it (swapped out fridge and stove some time ago, new lightbulbs, lots of cleaning etc.), so day to day only have to cover utilities (~300 EUR) and no rent to speak of. I try to save and invest a decent chunk of whatever I earn, sometimes funds managed by my bank, sometimes specific company stocks, a relatively small amount in crypto as well. At the same time I spend some of my money helping my friends that are less fortunate than me, like with medical expenses or getting food near payday etc., since while I feel comfortable with a bit of a spartan lifestyle, them not being able to afford necessities sucks and it'd feel bad to do nothing. Aside from that, I do get some knickknacks sometimes, like how I'm getting an Aigo AIO for my PC (~60 EUR, not strictly necessary, but might help with the Ryzen 7 5800X, ~150 EUR, throwing a hissy fit whenever I make it compile things) and a new Modecom PSU (~50 EUR, the old one rattles a bit, might be bad bearings on its fan, probably a good idea to replace it and not risk it frying things at some point), some new clothes (~150 EUR) and the usual boring stuff (e.g. groceries are around 250-300 EUR a month over here). Also visiting Germany later this year (~1000 EUR) for a programming event and to hang out with some lovely people. Probably won't have: a fancy gaming PC, or flagship phones/laptops, a car in the near future, my own apartment in a newly built building even in the more far future, or any sort of living in luxury. At the same time, I much prefer either being able to help others and also having some financial stability over having the latest shiny thing. Unfortunately, despite not living in excess, it very much feels like I'm one financial crisis away from financial ruin. Fun times. reply",

          "text": "I like to figure skate. I'm not competitive at all, just like putting on some headphones and gliding around and working on new moves. It can be a bit expensive. I like that it's a bit social too as you see the same adults all the time and it's also great if you have kids as they can do their own thing and socialize. It's good for exercise and balance. It's prob over $200/month on group and private lessons when put together for me (I skate for 3-6 hours a week). Skates vary in cost from $150 for beginner skates (both boot and blades) to $400 for intermediate. At the upper end, boots are $1k by themselves and blades are $500+. Your skates last a good while though assuming you're not an Olympian. Hockey has similar costs, but you also have to spend ~$1500 on gear as an adult. reply",

I spend a very long time feeling quite poor, since it took a while for the company to be big enough to pay me a real salary. And if you have kids on a low salary, all of your money goes to absolutely the most basic necessities. In recent years, I have had just a little bit extra, and I found satisfaction in paying off debts and contributing to a retirement fund for the first time. I also bought ski passes for myself and my kids and we had many enjoyable days on the mountain. I have rich friends who own three houses and make over a million a year just from investments. They’re quite content, but the extra money doesn’t seem to buy them much extra satisfaction. reply",

What remains either sits in savings, put towards to developing another source of income, or spent on games and beer. I am fairly lucky in that I can do most things I want to. I can buy things that I want with a little saving. I can eat out with the family. I can't travel too much, though I'd like to. The only \"normal life\" expense I can't afford is buying a home. It seems a long way off. I think the path forward will be moving states or working remote, as there are few jobs in software near me. At least at my experience level. For now I cannot complain. My quality of life is higher than most I know. Off topic, but I think about this a lot. reply",
