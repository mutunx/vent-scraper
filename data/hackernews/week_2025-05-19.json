          "text": "Redis Streams is a \"go-to\" for me, mostly because of operational simplicity and performance. It's also dead simple to write consumers in any language. If I had more stringent durability requirements, I would probably pick Redpanda, but Kafka-esque (!) processing semantics can be daunting sometimes. I didn't have anything but bad experiences with RabbitMQ, maybe I cannot \"cook\" it, but it would always go split-brain, or last issue I had, a part of clients connected to certain clustered nodes just stopped receiving messages. Cluster restart helped, but all logs and all metrics were green and clean. I try to avoid it if I can. ZeroMQ is more like a building block for your applications. If you need something very special, it could be a good fit, but for a typical EDA-ish bus architecture Redis or Kafka/Redpanda are both very good. reply",

          "text": "I would highlight a distinction between Queues and Streams, as I think this is an important factor in making this choice. In the case of a queue, you put an item in the queue, and then something removes it later. There is a single flow of items. They are put in. They are taken out. In the case of a stream, you put an item in the queue, then it can be removed multiple times by any other process that cares to do so. This may be called 'fan out'. This is an important distinction and really effects how one designs software that uses these systems. Queues work just fine for, say, background jobs. A user signs up, and you put a task in the 'send_registration_email' queue.[1] However, what if some _other_ system then cares about user sign ups? Well, you have to add another queue, and the user sign-up code needs to be aware of it. For example, a 'add_user_to_crm' queue. The result here is that choosing a queue early on leads to a tight-coupling of services down the road. The alternative is to choose streams. In this case, instead of saying what _should_ happen, you say what _did_ happen (past tense). Here you replace 'send_registration_email' and 'add_user_to_crm' with a single stream called 'used_registered'. Each service that cares about this fact is then free to subscribe to that steam and get its own copy of the events (it does so via a 'consumer group', or something of a similar name). This results in a more loosely coupled system, where you potentially also have access to an event history should you need it (if you configure your broker to keep the events around). -- This is where Postgresql and SQS tend to fall down. I've yet to hear of an implementation of streams in Postgresql[2]. And SQS is inherently a queue. I therefore normally reach for Redis Steams, but mostly because it is what I am familiar with. Note: This line of thinking leads into Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. Each of which is interesting and certainly has useful things to offer, although I would advise against simply consuming any of them wholesale. [1] Although this is my go-to example, I'm actually unconvinced that email sending should be done via a queue. Email is just a sequence of queues anyway.

Would be interesting to get your take on queues vs streams on the below. I consider myself a little late to the Postgres party after time with other nosql and rbdms, but it seems more and more an ok place to consider beginning from. For Streaming… Supabase has some Kafka stream type  examples that covers change data capture: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-wal-logical-replication Tables can also do some amount of stream like behaviour with visibility and timeout behaviours: pg-boss — durable job queues with visibility timeouts and retries. Zilla — supports Postgres as a source using CDC to act as a stream.\n • ElectricSQL — uses Postgres replication and CRDTs for reactive sync (great for frontend state as a stream Streaming inside Postgres also has some attention from Postgres as Event Store https://eventmodeling.org . This can combine event sourcing with Postgres for stream modeling. pgmq — from Tempo - this is a minimal message queue built on Postgres using append-only design.. Effectively works as a persistent stream with ordered delivery reply",

We wanted replayability and multiple clients on the same topic, so we evaluated Kafka, but we determined it was too operationally complex for our needs. Persistence was also unnecessary as the data stream already had a separate archiving system and existing clients only needed about 24hr max of context. AWS Kinesis ended up being simpler for our needs and I have nothing but good things to say about it for the most part. Streaming client support in Elixir was not as good as Kafka but writing our own adapter wasn’t too hard. reply",

          "text": "Google PubSub is what we use as our message queue, mostly for communicating change data capture via messages to other internal systems. Its typically being consumed by some job system polling on an interval and then doing CRUD to sync changes. Its not very complex and feels like we're running a lot of compute resources to just sync data between systems. Admittedly there isn't good separation of concerns so there is overlap that requires data syncs. I've been looking at things like kafka, etc. thinking there might be some magic there that makes us use less compute or makes data syncs a little easier to deal with but wonder what scale of data throughput is a tipping point where a service like that is really needed. If it turns out its just a different service but same timeliness of data sync and similar compute resources I struggle with what benefits might be provided. I'd love for almost like a levels.fyi style site where people could anonymously report things like this for the tech stacks being used, throughput of data, amount of compute in play, and ratings/comments on their overall solution (\"would do again\", \"don't recommend\", \"overkill\", \"resume filler\").  It feels much like other areas of technology where a use case comes out of a huge company and RDD (resume driven development) takes hold and now there are people out there doing the equivalent of souping up a 1997 honda accord like its a racecar but its only driving grandma to her appointments. reply",

A publisher just pushes rows in, and a subscriber takes an exclusive lock to grab the first row matching the annotations that it cares about (I use DELETE RETURNING, but you can make it work however you need). You can use `PRAGMA data_version` on a dedicated thread to watch for changes and notify other waiters via a condition variable.  It's not the nicest solution, because it's just a loop around a query, but it gets the job done. A req-rep pattern can be done by doing a `INSERT ... RETURNING id` and having the the other side re-push into the same or a different message queue with an annotation referring to that id.  Alternatively, you could have a table with a req, rep, and status column to coordinate it all. It's far from everything you'd need from a complete, robust message broker, but for small single or multi-process message queue with a max of a few dozen readers and writers, it gets the job done nicely.  In a single process, you can even replace the data_version loop thread with `sqlite3_commit_hook` on writers to notify readers that something has changed via the condition_variable. reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "Certainly. There are many paths to victory here. One thing to consider is whether you _want_ your producers to be aware of the clients or not. If you use SQS, then your producer needs to be aware of where it's sending the message. In event-driven architecture, ideally producers don't care who's listening. They just broadcast a message: \"Hey, this thing just happened.\" And anyone who wants to subscribe can subscribe. The analogy is a radio tower -- the radio broadcaster has no idea who's listening, but thousands and thousands of people can tune in and listen. Contrast to making a phone call, where you have to know who it is that you're dialing and you can only talk to one person at a time. There are pros and cons to both, but there's tremendous value in large applications for making the producer responsible for producing, but not having to worry about who is consuming. Particularly in organizations with large teams where coordinating that kind of thing can be a big pain. But you're absolutely right: queues/topics are basically free, and you can have as many as you want! I've certainly done it the SQS way that you describe many times! As I mentioned, there are many paths to victory. Mine works really well for me, and it sounds like yours works really well for you. That's fantastic :) reply",

The latter works, but yeah it eats compute. On the consumer side the duty cycle drives design. If it’s a steady flow then a polling listener is easy to right size. If the flow is episodic (long periods of idle with unpredictable spikes of high load) one option is to put a alarm on the queue that triggers when it goes from empty to non-empty, and handle that alarm by starting the processing machinery. That avoids the cost of constantly polling during dead time. reply",

I came to the realisation that the programming model especially in MSK is rather unintuitive. I found it hard to shift mentally from MSK and its even triggers back to regular consumer spun up in containers etc. but that also it rather MSK than Kafka. I am currently swapping out the whole pub/sub layer to MongoDB change streams, which I have found to be working really well. For queuing it attempts to lock on read so I can scale consumers with retry / backoff etc. Broadcast is simple and without locking, auto delete in Mongo. I will have to see how it really scales and I'm sure I'm trading one problem for another but, it will definitely help to remove a moving part. Overall, app is rather low volume with the occasional spike. I would have stayed with Kafka were there be let's say >100rpm on the core functions. reply",

          "text": "Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. Not across the network. RabbitMQ is neat out of the box. But I went with ZeroMQ at the time. ZeroMQ is cool but during current year I'd only use it to learn from their excellent documentation. Coming from Python, it taught me about Berkeley sockets and the process of building cross-language messaging patterns. After a few projects, it's like realizing I didn't need ZeroMQ to begin with I could make my own! If ZeroMQ's Hintjens were still with us I'd still be using it. It's like the documented incremental process of designing a messaging queue to fit your problem domain, plus a thin wrapper easing some of lower level socket nastiness. At least that's my experience using it over the years. Me talking about it won't do it enough justice. NATS does the lower level socket wrapper part very nicely. It's a but more modern too. Golang's designed to be like a slightly nicer C syntax, so it would make sense that it's high performance and sturdy. So it's similar to ZeroMQ there. I'm not sure if either persist to disk out of the box. So either of these are going to be simpler and faster than Kafka. The DB people are probably trying too hard to cater to the queues. Ideally I'd have normalized the data and modeled the relations such transactions don't lock up the whole table. Then I started questioning why I needed a queue at all when databases (sans SQLite which is fast enough as is) are made for pooling access to a database. Kafka supports pipelining to a relational database but this part is where you kind of have to be experienced to not footgun and I'm not at that level. I think using it as a queue in that you're short-circuiting it from the relational database pipeline is non-standard for Kafka. I suspect that's where a lot of the Kafka hate is from. I could understand if the distributed transactions part is hell but at that point it's like why'd you skip the database then? Trying to get that free lunch I assume. I have an alternative. Try inserting everything into a SQLite file. Running into concurrency issues? Use a second SQLite file. Two computers? send it over the network. More issues? Since it's SQL just switch to a real database that will pool the clients. Or switch to five of them. SQL is sorta cool that way. I assume that would avoid the reimplementing half of the JVM to sync across computers where you get Oracle Java showing up to sell you their database halfway into making your galactic scale software or the whatever. I must be stressed today. Thanks for asking. reply",

Unless the merciful admin lets me roll the 12-sided dice to replace the above cringe with the below piece I carved out of soap. --- I always check for maintained libraries for my programming languages for any messaging library. Bindings in many languages are consistent across Kafka, ZeroMQ, and NATS. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. The networking is a simple broadcast, not a shared queue. You also can't (canonically, at least) pop/insert/delete rows. It's append-only. It can do basic seeking, like replaying from the start. ZeroMQ is a good choice for learning from its excellent documentation, and programmers interested in C programming. Probably a good lead into Beej's networking guide. ZeroMQ is the odd one as it has no central broker (\"Zero\" for zero broker); you copy your favorite broker.py pattern from the ZeroMQ guide.

          "text": "Sir, your reply is more coherent than mine. I'll give you props for that. Still, I disagree that Kafka is always overkill. When god opened a datagram socket on your computer, you needed to have been capturing this data X months ago, but weren't paying attention. You need to build warbot.py and put it into production before you have the chance to deal with cold storage. Kafka is my go-to if you can do this before you run out of disk space. I frequently append JSON lines to a \"data.json\" file in Python. Add a socket server, compression, and typed bindings for 20+ languages. Boom. Kafka. Don't oversell it. Need to delete a row? Congratulations, you selected the wrong tool. It's appending JSON lines to a file. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue. To your point about Postgres, I've found Postgres has fantastic JSONB support and awesome developers who have been very influential in my life and whom I admire. Postgres is my preferred cold storage, which I connect to Kafka. It feels like swimming upstream because RMDBs are traditionally for normalized data, not denormalized JSON lines that make XML look hip again. If you have a choice in DB, Postgres' JSONB has helped me avoid unnecessary normalization steps. It's good to have options. ZeroMQ would call this the Titanic pattern and mic drop because the guide has a section on it. That's why I like ZeroMQ. Edit: Apologies for typos/brevity. I have an ancient phone that only works with 20% of the web and phone apps. There are no apps or LLMs to help this dyslexic soul. Reference for the Titanic pattern.

          "text": "It's important to distinguish between the use cases. Queues, streams, logs, databases, etc. are different kinds of tools you can use, and what the right tool is depends on your semantics. For example: Message queues are good for work that must be done in strict order where you want to deal with one message at a time. They aren't such a great fit for large batch movement of data, like logs or high volume events, because having a per-message acknowledgement state requires a lot of round trips over the network that simply isn't needed; you want to treat the entire bulk of the flow to carve out big chunks of it, because CPUs wnd networks and disks are more efficient when doing the same operation over large amounts of data in one go. If you are executing \"tasks\" (like image processing, ML inference, webhooks), ordering by insertion order might not be the right choice, either. Sometimes you want to coalesce (dedupe by key). Sometimes you want to ensure the processing for a key (e.g. a customer ID) is done in the same process and not randomly distributed over all your workers. Sometimes you want delivery to be strictly sequential, requiring an exclusive worker rather than massively parallel fan-out. And so on. Where I work, we use a mix of things depending on the application. I am a big fan of NATS. It's not itself a message queue, but its primitives can be combined to handle all sorts of behaviors. Core NATS is more like ephemeral pub/sub, while Jetstream gives you durable, highly available Kafka-like streams. I like combining queues with database state. Use the queue as an efficient way to order items (like jobs or events) for massively scalable distribution, and use the database to store the current state of things. For example, imagine you're delivering webhook messages. We first store the message in the database with the state \"pending\", then write an event to the queue about it. The worker receives the event, double-checks its state is still \"pending\", then executes it. If delivered, mark as \"done\" and ack the message. Otherwise, mark as \"failed\" and create a new queue message to retry. This way, you have durable state in a solid database, and the queue is an efficient way to coordinate the workers. (There's a bit more work here to ensure consistency, but this is the gist of it.) Core NATS is fantastic as a communication primitive between ephemeral processes. You can use it for RPC, for lightweight broadcasts (e.g. reload config everywhere), even for things like leases or caching or similar. Jetstream is like Kafka but more flexible; for example, each message has a wildcard subject that can be filtered on, so different consumers can very efficiently filter a big, commingled stream by interest. In Jetstream streams, messages have per-consumer ack/nack state in addition to a position, so you're not limited to Kafka's linear \"position\". Overall, a superb data model, and very easy to manage as infra. One weak point with NATS is a maximum message size of 10MB. This means that you sometimes have to invent your own chunking if your application needs to send larger payloads. Doing this opens up some cans of worms, so I honestly wouldn't recommend it. For large batch stuff, Redpanda is a better option. reply",

          "text": "I think you are asking the right question here. Before building something determine if there is a market, and if that market will pay. Personally my gut says no. I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

If you like walking try and walk around the centre as much as possible (without using phone mapping ideally), you'll realise it's quite small really and get to know the place. Take some time to experience the history, art galleries, theatre etc I wish I'd done more of that now I live in the provinces. Take time to see different parts of the UK, although I loved living in London for 2 years and visit a lot I way prefer other parts of the UK and now a lot of people live remotely it's practical to live in the midlands for example and go there for work once a week maybe. Take regular trips to Europe by plane, train or car. It's cheap and doable for a weekend. There is a lot of variety between countries/cities which I think you'd really appreciate. reply",

I've been here for ~10 years and feel like I'm familiar with a fairly narrow slice of it (mostly north/north east a little bit).

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

We sent them to various regions across Germany, but my guess is they ended up in a pile at the campground reception and never reached the actual owners. That said, we manually scraped around 500 campgrounds near us, designed postcards that highlighted CloudCamping’s key selling points, and sent them out using a different mailing service. Since we didn’t hear back from anyone specifically mentioning the postcards, I assume they didn’t convince anyone in the end. Still, it was a fun experiment, and who knows, it might work better in a different context! reply",

These days, if I were mailing postcards, I'd make sure to add a special QR code to them.

Without fail the creators happen to haha stumble in and happily take your feedback.

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

          "text": "I have my own domain (that I share with relatives), and use mailbox.org for hosting it. I chose them after a rather lengthy search. Reasons for choosing them(pros) - multiple \"payment accounts\" can share the same domain (securely), which was my primary reason for choosing them. I.e. I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently. Shouldn't be a problem, if the business is \"real\". I want to stress, that I am only a customer, no partner or affiliate or receive any benefit of writing this. reply",

Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

And when the domain expires there is usually [1] a period afterwards when it can be retrieved before anyone else can buy it. Set the domain to auto-renew, make sure the registrar has your payment details, set calendar reminders. Its not difficult. The alternative is gmail or similar, where you can lose access to your email, and perhaps the root of your digital \"identity\", at the whim of some hair-trigger algorithm [2] and be left unable to even communicate with the provider to get it fixed. So get a domain from a decent registrar. Pay several years in advance. Keep your payment and contact details up to date.

          "text": "> It seems there is no standard proper way to store private keys. The gold standard for this would be a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is essentially a device that stores private keys with certain guarantees of physical security (e.g, that private key material cannot be extracted from the device once it has been generated or placed there, and the device performs operations using the key material on behalf of some client). HSMs in various forms underpin all sorts of cryptosystems that society depends on, because securing private key material at rest is essential. You'll find them everywhere from your debit/credit card, to certificate authorities, financial institutions, defense, and your smartphone. For your use case, I'd recommend taking a look at Yubikeys. I did a writeup a while back on how to use them to store different types of private keys for various purposes: https://blog.ctis.me/2022/12/yubikey-piv-gpg/ reply",

I've kept everything that didn't die in sudden catastrophic failures.\nI can access files that I got before there was even a harddrive in my computer.\nAnd I love it, like browsing an old photo album, I once in a while take a stroll through my life, but, unlike the photo, which only captures one angle of a situation, I have entire installations to look at, what was on my desktop 20 years ago, what had I downloaded, oh, that movie, yeah, I remember it now! those funny pictures a long-forgotten friend send to me over IRC DCC, the chatlogs of our cringe teenage banter.. Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

          "text": "Not a single source of truth. The often cited study is [3] which shows longform writing to be more beneficial - it also comes to this conclusion: \"Although more notes are beneficial, at least to a point, if the notes are taken indiscriminately or by mindlessly transcribing content, as is more likely the case on a lap-top than when notes are taken longhand, the benefit dis-appears.\" There was a follow-up study made (see [1], [2]) that showed it made no difference in the end. It's what you do with it afterwards that really matters. Long story short? One form is not more superior to other, but I find typed text (in a digital document) easier to manipulate, transfer to other tools (i.e. Anki) and less friction when I'm thinking as I type. --- [1] https://www.themantic-education.com/ibpsych/2023/01/20/note-...

Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around.

Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

It will then send me emails about the things that I have saved recently and how they are all connected. You are welcome to try it and share anything feedback that you may have. At the moment, I can save markdown notes, websites, files, anything, and it shows everything in a nice grid view while also generating AI summaries, like TLDR and keywords (which I can then search for.) I will try to add those features / fix those bugs that you suggest. :) https://sunchay.com reply",

          "text": "I'm not a lawyer but have talked to a few founders who faced similar situations, ie. employee breaks the law or there's a substantial breach of ethics. 1) Document your case and speak to your lawyer. Pray they didn't do anything that would affect your customers/clients that could cause legal issues for you. I assume you're reviewing all their communications. 2) In most cases for early-stage companies, it's probably not worth it financially to pursue the case. It'll end up eating a lot of time, energy, and money that could've gone elsewhere. In the very least, documenting your case and throwing out some low-cost tactics could be useful for defensive purposes. 3) The priority at this point, I assume, is to re-establish your sales op. I would reach out to your professional networks and let them know not to work with this individual. Recruit your investors' networks as well, if any. The goal is to find good ways to protect yourself and your friends/partners. 4) Use the crisis to rally the team! You've been debuffed all this time! Turn this into a gift. 5) This sort of stuff happens all the time in one form or another. And it'll happen again. Anecdotally, I've found that it's happening more now with remote work where it's just harder to vet people. And if you're working cross-cultures, it can be even more difficult.

          "text": "I think the decline of FILE_ID.DIZ files is largely a byproduct of changing distribution methods. Back in the BBS and early FTP days, these small text files were crucial because they provided a quick summary for file archives, especially when bandwidth was limited, and you couldn't afford to waste time downloading the wrong file. With the rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, project descriptions and metadata have become more integrated. The README.md has essentially replaced FILE_ID.DIZ as the default \"project descriptor\", but with much more flexibility for formatting, linking, and even embedding media. Additionally, the way we discover and share software has changed. We now have package managers, app stores, and automatic metadata parsing tools that handle much of what these files used to do. Plus, we expect modern software to have much more comprehensive documentation than a few lines in a .DIZ file. reply",

          "text": "From a funding perspective I suppose it's pretty simple - like with all businesses the owners pony up the cash. The regular model is that you need cash, so you go looking for it, selling (part) ownership. In this case you have pre-determined the owners, and presumably their share %, so presumably they're putting up the cash. Alternatively you can go with a non-ownership approach. Ie a loan. That'll vote either an interest rate, and usually dome collateral (which I guess also comes from the owners.) If you go this route I recommend you get a lawyer to clearly explain the implications of liability - one participant can easily be on the hook for the whole loan, not just their share of it. They'd be much better off taking small individual loans to \"buy their share \" than participating in a group loan. Future admin work may also be affected by your governance model. There will be times when all owners need to sign, and you need to thus have mechanisms to strip ownership if the person leaves, or dies. Shareholdings which become part of their estate, and are inherited are a concern. In short, you need a lawyer well versed in these structures. Not just internet advice. I applaud your vision, but you need to think very carefully through all aspects of this. reply",

You're aligning incentives and sharing in the economic success, but using share restrictions to prevent, broadly speaking, shenanigans that are not aligned with your desired outcome. You wouldn't want shares transferred without board approval, for example. Craigslist was a cautionary tale about this [2], make sure your agreements are drafted to withstand potential adversaries. The culture should be clearly communicated about this when hiring and onboarding. Check out Certified EO [3] [4], they can help you.

          "text": "Lot of work happened in the last 5-10 years in the web3 space around tech-enabled participatory governance, with some funding backdrop because it's on top of a crypto platform. ENS is kind of the poster child https://docs.ens.domains/learn/protocol/ In terms of participation incentive models I like pointing people to slicing pie. The concept is simple enough and can learned from their free materials. Helpful mental model quantifying sweat \"equity\" where equity can be voting shares, or actual financial shares: https://slicingpie.com/ In terms of governance policy that is specific to your domain- what are the incentives and measures and countermeasures to ensure good behavior from the different roles of participants particular to therapy- there are certainly codes of conduct in the therapy space but probably this is going to be new work for you. I have read quite a bit in the anarchy space, including Graeber, and Chomsky's references and pull-outs from the moments during the Spanish Civil War when there was real movement here- regret to say that the prior thinking does not strike me as anywhere near sufficient to serve as models for the current shape of the world. A lot of new work has to get laid down for these to be real things. Democracy is a fragile mechanism that as we see can collapse quickly under lots of limited resource regimes and when community trust is fractured. High trust does not scale. Low trust is needed to scale and professionalize. But +1, think now is a good time for worker-controlled services to serve as a growing alternative to platform controlled services (just saw first Amazon therapy ad today, like, are you effing kidding me?)

Careful to ensure everyone stays on the right side of the IRS \"self-employed\" line, while trying to be coordinated and efficient about common expenses and benefits. Cooperative but not a democracy or cooperative per se- having participated in coops including the famous Park Slope Food Coop- think the low-trust semi-informed cooperative democracy is really, really hard to make work when the context ultimately is business and making a living. We have looked very closely at the web3 and especially programmatic stablecoin machinery, there are so many ways having little structures like that would help with risk and cash flow- like, being able to easily self-set up escrow structures with clients who may themselves have cash flow risk. Could definitely do it outside the US, adoption inside probably never get over the hump. Therapy is not so much project based but some common insurance and billing tooling, and then tax reporting, would be beneficial. Anyway, hope you are able to get traction. reply",

          "text": "Any result produced by current AI is suspect until proven otherwise. Any result comes at very high relative cost in terms of computing time and energy consumed. AI is the polar opposite of traditional logic based computing --- instead of highly accurate and reliable facts at low cost, you get unreliable opinions at high cost. There are valid uses cases for current AI but it is not a universal replacement for logic based programming that we all know and love --- not even close. Suggesting otherwise smacks of snake oil and hype. Legal liability for AI pronouncements is another on-going concern that remains to be fully addressed in the courts. One example: An AI chatbot accused a pro basketball player of vandalism due to references found of him \"throwing bricks\" during play. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4546063 reply",

          "text": "I would postulate a counterthesis that its not the language we speak that affects the way we think, but rather how much of that language we use and how much the (single) language is capable to express AND how much of different topics we read/hear (in that language). Just think of kids not so profound in their language - they think, they reason, but they can't argue about \"to be or not to be...\". But when they grow up, they more and more use and read other topics that utilize higher parts of the language, difficult sentences, etc.. -> so they LEARN and start to think differently on topics. so, my postulation is: the knowledge we gain shapes our thinking. Language itself is the transportation medium for the knowledge. Is the medium is small, so the knowledge described with the medium is also \"small\" or \"not destinctive enough\". We can use a \"second\" language then to make the knowledge more exact and mor destinct/tdefined. But the knowledge can also be gained with other means - learning by doing, as exmaple. So, a language is not necessary to gain knowledge (numb and deaf and blind people also think, but are somehow limited in their expression ...) so based on that, I postulate, it's a coincidence when a language shapes our thinking, but the cause and the \"affecting part\" is the real \"knowledge-transfer\" by the language. No matter if its sign language, pointing towards .. speaking piraha or russian or finnish-english. reply",

SourceHut, I don't use as much as I'd like, but the build and chat services keeps me paying. It's cheap, and I get a lot of enjoyment from using it. I think if you do these types of services, then you really need to make sure that people feel good about using your service. I know that's a tricky and rather fluffy goal, but you either need to be REALLY good and then you can charge more than $5, or you can make people feel good and if the amount is low, it becomes an easy renewal next month/year. If you're making a tool, fixed price for the current version, upgrade price for the next version, no subscription. I think we're at a point in time where your target audience would rather fork over $25 right now and then get a license, but would be hard press to give you $5 per month, even for a single month. reply",

The App Store model of small one-off payments works for this use-case. But no matter how useful a web tool is I don’t think I’d ever sign up for a small monthly fee for it. The ”mental overhead” of that is absolutely massive. Sadly even one off payments for web tools are a poor UX since there is no central broker to take care of it. Next time I visit I (maybe a different browser etc) it’s a hassle. I’d much rather just use a worse tool that is free. Because SaaS fatigue is real. Sorry hobbyists and startup dreamers I’m not paying money for your SaaS. Not because it’s not good enough but because it’s nearly impossible to be good enough to make me go through a subscription process. Even as an older person who can afford it and is used to paying for things, I’d much rather waste hours of my own time than pay a subscription. Importantly, I’d also much rather pay $100 once than $5/mo even if I don’t foresee using it for more than a year. Make it an App Store app and you can easily get $10 from me though, is the sad reality of it. reply",

          "text": "I've been paying a premium subscription to Focumon ( https://www.focumon.com/ ) for a year and a month. It's a small Pokémon themed productivity tool that I found promoted here on this site. The paid subscription doesn't really give you much, but is inexpensive and I want to support the creator. Small web tools have some advantages that could make them sustainable as a business model. Off the top of my head, some of these are: * Creators are way more reachable, they often get back to you directly when you send them feedback. Sometimes, even, you get to have longer conversations with them too. * You have more impact on what the product evolves into. It's also likely that you get some minor features added if you ask for them. * Smaller tools are able to resist against enshittification with less of an effort. Doesn't mean that it may not happen, of course. If you're asking this because you want to create a small web tool, I'd say the best advice you could use is to make something you like, make it reliable, and be proactive in engaging with you clients / let them reach out easily, demonstrating that you can and will listen and care about their concerns. And if you create something you're proud of and have value, feel more than welcome of posting it here! reply",

There's almost always room for something better, and if what you build is that, then some people will pay. Unless the tools have large running costs, consider offering them for free (at least at first). A few things are likely to happen: Nobody cares enough to sign up – fine, zero users, zero costs. People use it but don’t stick around – ask them what would make the tool more valuable. People use it a lot – great, now you can charge for the value. Two examples come to mind: spaced repetition app Mochi and markdown editor Typora. Mochi is $5 a month, I think. Typora was free and is now a $15 one-time purchase.

I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm more interested in multi-use simple tools. For example, an app that solves a common small problem/inconvenience really well is probably worth $5/mo (I would probably pay for that), but I can't imagine anyone just buys subscriptions to indie apps haha. I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

An idea for a disrupting company would be to open source their LLM and offer support and feature development to enterprises as the paid offering, kinda like Red Hat or others doing that model.

The good part about this analogy is that the needs of the users aren't very dynamic -- if you are using a CAD software it is for design tasks. The interface may change, but the purpose doesn't. Because of this, the quality gap between free CAD packages and LLMs are natural language models (what words are likely to come next given the context), not any sort of AGI. For that purpose, the gap between open and closed models is closing much faster in LLMs than CAD. I think LLMs will go the way of chess engines -- one of these models will become the Stockfish of LLMs and the proprietary models will end up being a waste of money and resources. reply",

          "text": "I would highlight a distinction between Queues and Streams, as I think this is an important factor in making this choice. In the case of a queue, you put an item in the queue, and then something removes it later. There is a single flow of items. They are put in. They are taken out. In the case of a stream, you put an item in the queue, then it can be removed multiple times by any other process that cares to do so. This may be called 'fan out'. This is an important distinction and really effects how one designs software that uses these systems. Queues work just fine for, say, background jobs. A user signs up, and you put a task in the 'send_registration_email' queue.[1] However, what if some _other_ system then cares about user sign ups? Well, you have to add another queue, and the user sign-up code needs to be aware of it. For example, a 'add_user_to_crm' queue. The result here is that choosing a queue early on leads to a tight-coupling of services down the road. The alternative is to choose streams. In this case, instead of saying what _should_ happen, you say what _did_ happen (past tense). Here you replace 'send_registration_email' and 'add_user_to_crm' with a single stream called 'used_registered'. Each service that cares about this fact is then free to subscribe to that steam and get its own copy of the events (it does so via a 'consumer group', or something of a similar name). This results in a more loosely coupled system, where you potentially also have access to an event history should you need it (if you configure your broker to keep the events around). -- This is where Postgresql and SQS tend to fall down. I've yet to hear of an implementation of streams in Postgresql[2]. And SQS is inherently a queue. I therefore normally reach for Redis Steams, but mostly because it is what I am familiar with. Note: This line of thinking leads into Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. Each of which is interesting and certainly has useful things to offer, although I would advise against simply consuming any of them wholesale. [1] Although this is my go-to example, I'm actually unconvinced that email sending should be done via a queue. Email is just a sequence of queues anyway. [2] If you know of one please tell me! reply",

For Streaming… Supabase has some Kafka stream type  examples that covers change data capture: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-wal-logical-replication Tables can also do some amount of stream like behaviour with visibility and timeout behaviours: pg-boss — durable job queues with visibility timeouts and retries. Zilla — supports Postgres as a source using CDC to act as a stream.\n • ElectricSQL — uses Postgres replication and CRDTs for reactive sync (great for frontend state as a stream Streaming inside Postgres also has some attention from Postgres as Event Store https://eventmodeling.org . This can combine event sourcing with Postgres for stream modeling. pgmq — from Tempo - this is a minimal message queue built on Postgres using append-only design.. Effectively works as a persistent stream with ordered delivery reply",

I didn't have anything but bad experiences with RabbitMQ, maybe I cannot \"cook\" it, but it would always go split-brain, or last issue I had, a part of clients connected to certain clustered nodes just stopped receiving messages. Cluster restart helped, but all logs and all metrics were green and clean. I try to avoid it if I can. ZeroMQ is more like a building block for your applications.

Persistence was also unnecessary as the data stream already had a separate archiving system and existing clients only needed about 24hr max of context. AWS Kinesis ended up being simpler for our needs and I have nothing but good things to say about it for the most part.

          "text": "Google PubSub is what we use as our message queue, mostly for communicating change data capture via messages to other internal systems. Its typically being consumed by some job system polling on an interval and then doing CRUD to sync changes. Its not very complex and feels like we're running a lot of compute resources to just sync data between systems. Admittedly there isn't good separation of concerns so there is overlap that requires data syncs. I've been looking at things like kafka, etc. thinking there might be some magic there that makes us use less compute or makes data syncs a little easier to deal with but wonder what scale of data throughput is a tipping point where a service like that is really needed. If it turns out its just a different service but same timeliness of data sync and similar compute resources I struggle with what benefits might be provided. I'd love for almost like a levels.fyi style site where people could anonymously report things like this for the tech stacks being used, throughput of data, amount of compute in play, and ratings/comments on their overall solution (\"would do again\", \"don't recommend\", \"overkill\", \"resume filler\").  It feels much like other areas of technology where a use case comes out of a huge company and RDD (resume driven development) takes hold and now there are people out there doing the equivalent of souping up a 1997 honda accord like its a racecar but its only driving grandma to her appointments. reply",

A publisher just pushes rows in, and a subscriber takes an exclusive lock to grab the first row matching the annotations that it cares about (I use DELETE RETURNING, but you can make it work however you need). You can use `PRAGMA data_version` on a dedicated thread to watch for changes and notify other waiters via a condition variable.  It's not the nicest solution, because it's just a loop around a query, but it gets the job done. A req-rep pattern can be done by doing a `INSERT ... RETURNING id` and having the the other side re-push into the same or a different message queue with an annotation referring to that id.  Alternatively, you could have a table with a req, rep, and status column to coordinate it all. It's far from everything you'd need from a complete, robust message broker, but for small single or multi-process message queue with a max of a few dozen readers and writers, it gets the job done nicely.  In a single process, you can even replace the data_version loop thread with `sqlite3_commit_hook` on writers to notify readers that something has changed via the condition_variable. reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "Certainly. There are many paths to victory here. One thing to consider is whether you _want_ your producers to be aware of the clients or not. If you use SQS, then your producer needs to be aware of where it's sending the message. In event-driven architecture, ideally producers don't care who's listening. They just broadcast a message: \"Hey, this thing just happened.\" And anyone who wants to subscribe can subscribe. The analogy is a radio tower -- the radio broadcaster has no idea who's listening, but thousands and thousands of people can tune in and listen. Contrast to making a phone call, where you have to know who it is that you're dialing and you can only talk to one person at a time. There are pros and cons to both, but there's tremendous value in large applications for making the producer responsible for producing, but not having to worry about who is consuming. Particularly in organizations with large teams where coordinating that kind of thing can be a big pain. But you're absolutely right: queues/topics are basically free, and you can have as many as you want! I've certainly done it the SQS way that you describe many times! As I mentioned, there are many paths to victory. Mine works really well for me, and it sounds like yours works really well for you. That's fantastic :) reply",

For example, at some point I had a timestamp header but only very much later realised that it all ends up as number[] on the consumer side. So I lost data. My fault, but still. I came to the realisation that the programming model especially in MSK is rather unintuitive. I found it hard to shift mentally from MSK and its even triggers back to regular consumer spun up in containers etc. but that also it rather MSK than Kafka. I am currently swapping out the whole pub/sub layer to MongoDB change streams, which I have found to be working really well. For queuing it attempts to lock on read so I can scale consumers with retry / backoff etc. Broadcast is simple and without locking, auto delete in Mongo. I will have to see how it really scales and I'm sure I'm trading one problem for another but, it will definitely help to remove a moving part. Overall, app is rather low volume with the occasional spike. I would have stayed with Kafka were there be let's say >100rpm on the core functions. reply",

          "text": "Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. Not across the network. RabbitMQ is neat out of the box. But I went with ZeroMQ at the time. ZeroMQ is cool but during current year I'd only use it to learn from their excellent documentation. Coming from Python, it taught me about Berkeley sockets and the process of building cross-language messaging patterns. After a few projects, it's like realizing I didn't need ZeroMQ to begin with I could make my own! If ZeroMQ's Hintjens were still with us I'd still be using it. It's like the documented incremental process of designing a messaging queue to fit your problem domain, plus a thin wrapper easing some of lower level socket nastiness. At least that's my experience using it over the years. Me talking about it won't do it enough justice. NATS does the lower level socket wrapper part very nicely. It's a but more modern too. Golang's designed to be like a slightly nicer C syntax, so it would make sense that it's high performance and sturdy. So it's similar to ZeroMQ there. I'm not sure if either persist to disk out of the box. So either of these are going to be simpler and faster than Kafka. The DB people are probably trying too hard to cater to the queues. Ideally I'd have normalized the data and modeled the relations such transactions don't lock up the whole table. Then I started questioning why I needed a queue at all when databases (sans SQLite which is fast enough as is) are made for pooling access to a database. Kafka supports pipelining to a relational database but this part is where you kind of have to be experienced to not footgun and I'm not at that level. I think using it as a queue in that you're short-circuiting it from the relational database pipeline is non-standard for Kafka. I suspect that's where a lot of the Kafka hate is from. I could understand if the distributed transactions part is hell but at that point it's like why'd you skip the database then? Trying to get that free lunch I assume. I have an alternative. Try inserting everything into a SQLite file. Running into concurrency issues? Use a second SQLite file. Two computers? send it over the network. More issues? Since it's SQL just switch to a real database that will pool the clients. Or switch to five of them. SQL is sorta cool that way. I assume that would avoid the reimplementing half of the JVM to sync across computers where you get Oracle Java showing up to sell you their database halfway into making your galactic scale software or the whatever. I must be stressed today. Thanks for asking. reply",

Unless the merciful admin lets me roll the 12-sided dice to replace the above cringe with the below piece I carved out of soap. --- I always check for maintained libraries for my programming languages for any messaging library. Bindings in many languages are consistent across Kafka, ZeroMQ, and NATS. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. The networking is a simple broadcast, not a shared queue. You also can't (canonically, at least) pop/insert/delete rows. It's append-only. It can do basic seeking, like replaying from the start. ZeroMQ is a good choice for learning from its excellent documentation, and programmers interested in C programming. Probably a good lead into Beej's networking guide. ZeroMQ is the odd one as it has no central broker (\"Zero\" for zero broker); you copy your favorite broker.py pattern from the ZeroMQ guide.

          "text": "Sir, your reply is more coherent than mine. I'll give you props for that. Still, I disagree that Kafka is always overkill. When god opened a datagram socket on your computer, you needed to have been capturing this data X months ago, but weren't paying attention. You need to build warbot.py and put it into production before you have the chance to deal with cold storage. Kafka is my go-to if you can do this before you run out of disk space. I frequently append JSON lines to a \"data.json\" file in Python. Add a socket server, compression, and typed bindings for 20+ languages. Boom. Kafka. Don't oversell it. Need to delete a row? Congratulations, you selected the wrong tool. It's appending JSON lines to a file. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue. To your point about Postgres, I've found Postgres has fantastic JSONB support and awesome developers who have been very influential in my life and whom I admire. Postgres is my preferred cold storage, which I connect to Kafka. It feels like swimming upstream because RMDBs are traditionally for normalized data, not denormalized JSON lines that make XML look hip again. If you have a choice in DB, Postgres' JSONB has helped me avoid unnecessary normalization steps. It's good to have options. ZeroMQ would call this the Titanic pattern and mic drop because the guide has a section on it. That's why I like ZeroMQ. Edit: Apologies for typos/brevity. I have an ancient phone that only works with 20% of the web and phone apps. There are no apps or LLMs to help this dyslexic soul. Reference for the Titanic pattern.

          "text": "It's important to distinguish between the use cases. Queues, streams, logs, databases, etc. are different kinds of tools you can use, and what the right tool is depends on your semantics. For example: Message queues are good for work that must be done in strict order where you want to deal with one message at a time. They aren't such a great fit for large batch movement of data, like logs or high volume events, because having a per-message acknowledgement state requires a lot of round trips over the network that simply isn't needed; you want to treat the entire bulk of the flow to carve out big chunks of it, because CPUs wnd networks and disks are more efficient when doing the same operation over large amounts of data in one go. If you are executing \"tasks\" (like image processing, ML inference, webhooks), ordering by insertion order might not be the right choice, either. Sometimes you want to coalesce (dedupe by key). Sometimes you want to ensure the processing for a key (e.g. a customer ID) is done in the same process and not randomly distributed over all your workers. Sometimes you want delivery to be strictly sequential, requiring an exclusive worker rather than massively parallel fan-out. And so on. Where I work, we use a mix of things depending on the application. I am a big fan of NATS. It's not itself a message queue, but its primitives can be combined to handle all sorts of behaviors. Core NATS is more like ephemeral pub/sub, while Jetstream gives you durable, highly available Kafka-like streams. I like combining queues with database state. Use the queue as an efficient way to order items (like jobs or events) for massively scalable distribution, and use the database to store the current state of things. For example, imagine you're delivering webhook messages. We first store the message in the database with the state \"pending\", then write an event to the queue about it. The worker receives the event, double-checks its state is still \"pending\", then executes it. If delivered, mark as \"done\" and ack the message. Otherwise, mark as \"failed\" and create a new queue message to retry. This way, you have durable state in a solid database, and the queue is an efficient way to coordinate the workers. (There's a bit more work here to ensure consistency, but this is the gist of it.) Core NATS is fantastic as a communication primitive between ephemeral processes. You can use it for RPC, for lightweight broadcasts (e.g. reload config everywhere), even for things like leases or caching or similar. Jetstream is like Kafka but more flexible; for example, each message has a wildcard subject that can be filtered on, so different consumers can very efficiently filter a big, commingled stream by interest. In Jetstream streams, messages have per-consumer ack/nack state in addition to a position, so you're not limited to Kafka's linear \"position\". Overall, a superb data model, and very easy to manage as infra. One weak point with NATS is a maximum message size of 10MB. This means that you sometimes have to invent your own chunking if your application needs to send larger payloads. Doing this opens up some cans of worms, so I honestly wouldn't recommend it. For large batch stuff, Redpanda is a better option. reply",

Cool travel collaboration things were probably old hat when I was working on one [1] in 2005. :P I left the travel industry in 2011, but if any of my knowledge still applies, and you want to make some money... you need to do things to drive hotel bookings. You probably need a catalog of hotels and places to visit anyway to help users plan things. But make sure you have a way for your users to book those hotels and you to get a commission. Make sure you're making landing pages for people to find with search engines. You'll probably want/need to pay to get people into those same landing pages, so you'll need to be tracking revenue at a very granular level, so you can bid higher on the pages that make you more money, and less (or not at all) on the pages that don't. And if you're in multiple commission programs (which you should be), you can be sure to highlight the ones that make you more money. You may want to have something t help your users make airplane and car bookings too, but those margins are slim, so work on hotels first. [1] https://lifehacker.com/yahoo-trip-planner-100875 reply",

          "text": "Thank you for the thoughtful pushback. This is exactly the kind of discussion I was hoping for. I totally agree that FOSS + support can be a great model in the right context. We’re definitely not trying to reinvent DRM or lock users out of their own systems without recourse. Here’s how we think about it: Many developers building self-hosted tools try to monetize in good faith, especially when selling to large enterprises. But they often lose control over renewals, never-ending trials, and multiple unlicensed deployments. The current model: Send a zip or Docker file and hope, just doesn’t scale. Kage isn’t about locking software down. It’s about helping developers protect and grow the value of what they’ve built, without needing to write custom scripts or chase invoices. Think of it more like Stripe or Terraform Cloud for licensing and compliance, not DRM or spyware. That said, false positives are a real risk, and we’ve designed Kage to be graceful by default: - Licenses include grace periods, pre-expiration alerts, and non-blocking modes. - You can configure what happens when a license expires from “notify only” to “disable premium features” or “shut down in sandbox environments.” - It’s all transparent and developer-controllable. We’re also open-sourcing key parts of the platform (CLI tools, SDKs, deployment templates) to make it auditable and community-driven. Our goal is to give developers more tools, not take control away from users. Would love to hear more about what a fair and developer-friendly enforcement system looks like to you (or others here). We’re building this for developers first, and that means getting it right. reply",

          "text": "IMO the \"sales/businesses\" magic was they billed a high-ish hourly rate for every single minute from start to end of the task however their assistant defined it from their perspective, even during the downtime waiting for stuff to happen while they made a few phone calls and outsourced the help to either occur or get set up.  This is not expensive for stuff that they can set up fast from start to end, but could adds up a lot if the assistant needs to babysit a multi-hour process for you, IIRC. It's possible that other people had other experiences.  But I don't think they were starting a clock, doing stuff, then stopping the clock when just waiting for responses from third parties.  It was more like start clock, get stuff done until it's all done or set up with no further input needed, then stop the clock.  Which is ok, but is not the real magic I originally assumed might make it really efficient as a user (and efficient as a task-orchestration assistant). The real magic was you interfaced with them simply, by text message, to achieve whatever the goal was, after signing up and being \"accepted\".  The simplicity and flexibility of what the assistant could do, so long as you could pay the bill (whatever they outsourced for you plus their own charge), was what it was worth. Go to web page, put in phone number and billing info, and agree to the terms/rate.  Get magic # to text when you need assistance. Text # when you need it.  Clock starts.  Get help squared way.  Pretty low effort, they could help with a lot. I don't know what the tech was in the background, there was nothing magic about it AFAICT.  Maybe Google Docs/Sheets.  Or, an Asana instance + Wiki + Slack could take care of some assistant doing a task and documenting it for reference, building knowledge of how to get what done.  You could use the Issues in Gitea if you want open source, I guess. As I understand it, Magic the YC company thought they could collect data on what people need and automate the common stuff but I remember reading that that never materialized and they pivoted.  Frankly the current offering looks more complicated now at https://getmagic.com/how-it-works/ and truly the magic as an offering to the customer was the simplicity and flexibility. So for the OP, offer a single SMS number your people can text to get answers or get something done, hiding all the operational detail whatever it is.  Obviously, SMS is insecure, so whatever your SSO chat system is at work would be the replacement. Or a single QR code to get started with the \"do anything\" chat assistant, and equally strong branding. But a simple, familiar, \"do anything for me\" interface was the idea. I'll say this, to Magic's credit.  They helped me get sh* done that I was really putting off and was really too focused on other things for, and that I needed some help just getting done.  And they got it done for me.  Thanks, YC and Magic.  It's still a good idea. reply",

          "text": "I think you might not get serious responses, but I think this is an interesting question since I think AI is a better fit for management than many other jobs. Nobody would have believed it 10 years ago, but today AI is more likely to replace a concept artist than an accountant, so it's not beyond imagination to replace a manager even if the ICs are still human. AI excels at summarization, which is a big part of the job for a lot of managers. They gather information, go to meetings, write reports, and generally re-share information appropriate for whatever audience. At a lot of companies, the lowest level managers don't make a lot of decisions either. Tech leads make technical decisions, PMs make product decisions, and the skip-levels (e.g. Directors, VPs) make staffing decisions. In practice, I don't think humans will report to AIs, but hierarchies might flatten (e.g. ICs report to Directors) and responsibilities might get shuffled around (e.g. some duties get assigned to HR). If the workers are AI-bots, then I don't really see any skill overlap with management. If you manage only AIs, you are an IC, not management. reply",

It makes sense to me that AI could conceivably already be as good at making the hard, data-based decisions that CEOs make, and that, therefore, they could one day be replaced by AI. Meanwhile, you've got the soft skills part of being an executive, which humans are better at (as long as the people they deal with are also humans). So, you could split that CEO role into two parts, each specializing in half of what a CEO today does. Both roles would probably do a better job than the median CEO today, and get paid less overall. But that \"not anytime soon\" part is the only thing I disagree with. Because I just don't know how long the timeline is for stuff like that. It can change pretty fast. reply",

Instead of starting with a question of replacing roles (and some certainly will), it'll start with redefining how work gets done, and updating job descriptions accordingly.

This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

          "text": "My friend and I have been building an app over the past few years, and it's been a slow, sometimes painful grind. We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

The prompts are like this: https://gist.github.com/jc4p/d8b9d121425ec191d62602d8720eeed... and the rest of it is a Nextjs app wrapped around the WebRTC connection.

While the transcription is technically in the API it's not a native part of the model and runs through Whisper separately, in my testing with it I often end up with a transcription that's a different language than what the user is speaking and the current API has no way to force a language on the internal Whisper call. If the language is correct, a lot of the times the exact text isn't 100% accurate, if that's 100% accurate, it comes in slower than the audio output and not in real time. All in all not what I would consider feature ready to release in my app. What I've been thinking about is switching to a full audio in --> transcribe --> send to LLM --> TTS pipeline, in which case I would be able to show the exact input to the model, but that's way more work than just one single OpenAI API call. reply",

I tried Gliglish but didn’t like how it was structured. So I started turning my own “learn a language before a trip” routine into something easier to use. Dutch is not supported yet, and there are still some rough edges. But the idea is simple: help people remember words by using them. You say or type something, and get a reply you can hear or read. In conversations on IF, there is no fixed path. You can start with a topic, then ask to switch to something else. It’s meant to be low-pressure and flexible. Still figuring things out.

I am speaking Danish from time to time, but it's only to get better at it. The English proficiency in Denmark (and probably the Netherlands) is so high that you need to be really good at the native tongue before it is easier than English in conversations. reply",

If yes, just do it. to many people it is endearing if you are struggling with a language. And if they don't like it they probably just don't like talking to you in general so learned or not doesn't matter. I think many people are scared of talking and use language learning as an excuse for fear.

An idea for a disrupting company would be to open source their LLM and offer support and feature development to enterprises as the paid offering, kinda like Red Hat or others doing that model. A key difference is running an LLM locally on decent sized compute is fine but it will be costly to scale on your own. reply",

The good part about this analogy is that the needs of the users aren't very dynamic -- if you are using a CAD software it is for design tasks. The interface may change, but the purpose doesn't. Because of this, the quality gap between free CAD packages and LLMs are natural language models (what words are likely to come next given the context), not any sort of AGI. For that purpose, the gap between open and closed models is closing much faster in LLMs than CAD.

          "text": "I would highlight a distinction between Queues and Streams, as I think this is an important factor in making this choice. In the case of a queue, you put an item in the queue, and then something removes it later. There is a single flow of items. They are put in. They are taken out. In the case of a stream, you put an item in the queue, then it can be removed multiple times by any other process that cares to do so. This may be called 'fan out'. This is an important distinction and really effects how one designs software that uses these systems. Queues work just fine for, say, background jobs. A user signs up, and you put a task in the 'send_registration_email' queue.[1] However, what if some _other_ system then cares about user sign ups? Well, you have to add another queue, and the user sign-up code needs to be aware of it. For example, a 'add_user_to_crm' queue. The result here is that choosing a queue early on leads to a tight-coupling of services down the road. The alternative is to choose streams. In this case, instead of saying what _should_ happen, you say what _did_ happen (past tense). Here you replace 'send_registration_email' and 'add_user_to_crm' with a single stream called 'used_registered'. Each service that cares about this fact is then free to subscribe to that steam and get its own copy of the events (it does so via a 'consumer group', or something of a similar name). This results in a more loosely coupled system, where you potentially also have access to an event history should you need it (if you configure your broker to keep the events around). -- This is where Postgresql and SQS tend to fall down. I've yet to hear of an implementation of streams in Postgresql[2]. And SQS is inherently a queue. I therefore normally reach for Redis Steams, but mostly because it is what I am familiar with. Note: This line of thinking leads into Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. Each of which is interesting and certainly has useful things to offer, although I would advise against simply consuming any of them wholesale. [1] Although this is my go-to example, I'm actually unconvinced that email sending should be done via a queue. Email is just a sequence of queues anyway.

For Streaming… Supabase has some Kafka stream type  examples that covers change data capture: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-wal-logical-replication Tables can also do some amount of stream like behaviour with visibility and timeout behaviours: pg-boss — durable job queues with visibility timeouts and retries. Zilla — supports Postgres as a source using CDC to act as a stream.\n • ElectricSQL — uses Postgres replication and CRDTs for reactive sync (great for frontend state as a stream Streaming inside Postgres also has some attention from Postgres as Event Store https://eventmodeling.org . This can combine event sourcing with Postgres for stream modeling. pgmq — from Tempo - this is a minimal message queue built on Postgres using append-only design..

Persistence was also unnecessary as the data stream already had a separate archiving system and existing clients only needed about 24hr max of context. AWS Kinesis ended up being simpler for our needs and I have nothing but good things to say about it for the most part.

I didn't have anything but bad experiences with RabbitMQ, maybe I cannot \"cook\" it, but it would always go split-brain, or last issue I had, a part of clients connected to certain clustered nodes just stopped receiving messages. Cluster restart helped, but all logs and all metrics were green and clean. I try to avoid it if I can. ZeroMQ is more like a building block for your applications.

Its typically being consumed by some job system polling on an interval and then doing CRUD to sync changes. Its not very complex and feels like we're running a lot of compute resources to just sync data between systems. Admittedly there isn't good separation of concerns so there is overlap that requires data syncs. I've been looking at things like kafka, etc. thinking there might be some magic there that makes us use less compute or makes data syncs a little easier to deal with but wonder what scale of data throughput is a tipping point where a service like that is really needed. If it turns out its just a different service but same timeliness of data sync and similar compute resources I struggle with what benefits might be provided. I'd love for almost like a levels.fyi style site where people could anonymously report things like this for the tech stacks being used, throughput of data, amount of compute in play, and ratings/comments on their overall solution (\"would do again\", \"don't recommend\", \"overkill\", \"resume filler\").  It feels much like other areas of technology where a use case comes out of a huge company and RDD (resume driven development) takes hold and now there are people out there doing the equivalent of souping up a 1997 honda accord like its a racecar but its only driving grandma to her appointments. reply",

A publisher just pushes rows in, and a subscriber takes an exclusive lock to grab the first row matching the annotations that it cares about (I use DELETE RETURNING, but you can make it work however you need). You can use `PRAGMA data_version` on a dedicated thread to watch for changes and notify other waiters via a condition variable.  It's not the nicest solution, because it's just a loop around a query, but it gets the job done. A req-rep pattern can be done by doing a `INSERT ... RETURNING id` and having the the other side re-push into the same or a different message queue with an annotation referring to that id.  Alternatively, you could have a table with a req, rep, and status column to coordinate it all. It's far from everything you'd need from a complete, robust message broker, but for small single or multi-process message queue with a max of a few dozen readers and writers, it gets the job done nicely.  In a single process, you can even replace the data_version loop thread with `sqlite3_commit_hook` on writers to notify readers that something has changed via the condition_variable. reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "Certainly. There are many paths to victory here. One thing to consider is whether you _want_ your producers to be aware of the clients or not. If you use SQS, then your producer needs to be aware of where it's sending the message. In event-driven architecture, ideally producers don't care who's listening. They just broadcast a message: \"Hey, this thing just happened.\" And anyone who wants to subscribe can subscribe. The analogy is a radio tower -- the radio broadcaster has no idea who's listening, but thousands and thousands of people can tune in and listen. Contrast to making a phone call, where you have to know who it is that you're dialing and you can only talk to one person at a time. There are pros and cons to both, but there's tremendous value in large applications for making the producer responsible for producing, but not having to worry about who is consuming. Particularly in organizations with large teams where coordinating that kind of thing can be a big pain. But you're absolutely right: queues/topics are basically free, and you can have as many as you want! I've certainly done it the SQS way that you describe many times! As I mentioned, there are many paths to victory. Mine works really well for me, and it sounds like yours works really well for you. That's fantastic :) reply",

The latter works, but yeah it eats compute. On the consumer side the duty cycle drives design. If it’s a steady flow then a polling listener is easy to right size. If the flow is episodic (long periods of idle with unpredictable spikes of high load) one option is to put a alarm on the queue that triggers when it goes from empty to non-empty, and handle that alarm by starting the processing machinery.

I came to the realisation that the programming model especially in MSK is rather unintuitive. I found it hard to shift mentally from MSK and its even triggers back to regular consumer spun up in containers etc. but that also it rather MSK than Kafka. I am currently swapping out the whole pub/sub layer to MongoDB change streams, which I have found to be working really well. For queuing it attempts to lock on read so I can scale consumers with retry / backoff etc. Broadcast is simple and without locking, auto delete in Mongo. I will have to see how it really scales and I'm sure I'm trading one problem for another but, it will definitely help to remove a moving part.

          "text": "Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. Not across the network. RabbitMQ is neat out of the box. But I went with ZeroMQ at the time. ZeroMQ is cool but during current year I'd only use it to learn from their excellent documentation. Coming from Python, it taught me about Berkeley sockets and the process of building cross-language messaging patterns. After a few projects, it's like realizing I didn't need ZeroMQ to begin with I could make my own! If ZeroMQ's Hintjens were still with us I'd still be using it. It's like the documented incremental process of designing a messaging queue to fit your problem domain, plus a thin wrapper easing some of lower level socket nastiness. At least that's my experience using it over the years. Me talking about it won't do it enough justice. NATS does the lower level socket wrapper part very nicely. It's a but more modern too. Golang's designed to be like a slightly nicer C syntax, so it would make sense that it's high performance and sturdy. So it's similar to ZeroMQ there. I'm not sure if either persist to disk out of the box. So either of these are going to be simpler and faster than Kafka. The DB people are probably trying too hard to cater to the queues. Ideally I'd have normalized the data and modeled the relations such transactions don't lock up the whole table. Then I started questioning why I needed a queue at all when databases (sans SQLite which is fast enough as is) are made for pooling access to a database. Kafka supports pipelining to a relational database but this part is where you kind of have to be experienced to not footgun and I'm not at that level. I think using it as a queue in that you're short-circuiting it from the relational database pipeline is non-standard for Kafka. I suspect that's where a lot of the Kafka hate is from. I could understand if the distributed transactions part is hell but at that point it's like why'd you skip the database then? Trying to get that free lunch I assume. I have an alternative. Try inserting everything into a SQLite file. Running into concurrency issues? Use a second SQLite file. Two computers? send it over the network. More issues? Since it's SQL just switch to a real database that will pool the clients. Or switch to five of them. SQL is sorta cool that way. I assume that would avoid the reimplementing half of the JVM to sync across computers where you get Oracle Java showing up to sell you their database halfway into making your galactic scale software or the whatever. I must be stressed today. Thanks for asking. reply",

Unless the merciful admin lets me roll the 12-sided dice to replace the above cringe with the below piece I carved out of soap. --- I always check for maintained libraries for my programming languages for any messaging library. Bindings in many languages are consistent across Kafka, ZeroMQ, and NATS. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. The networking is a simple broadcast, not a shared queue. You also can't (canonically, at least) pop/insert/delete rows. It's append-only. It can do basic seeking, like replaying from the start. ZeroMQ is a good choice for learning from its excellent documentation, and programmers interested in C programming. Probably a good lead into Beej's networking guide. ZeroMQ is the odd one as it has no central broker (\"Zero\" for zero broker); you copy your favorite broker.py pattern from the ZeroMQ guide.

          "text": "Sir, your reply is more coherent than mine. I'll give you props for that. Still, I disagree that Kafka is always overkill. When god opened a datagram socket on your computer, you needed to have been capturing this data X months ago, but weren't paying attention. You need to build warbot.py and put it into production before you have the chance to deal with cold storage. Kafka is my go-to if you can do this before you run out of disk space. I frequently append JSON lines to a \"data.json\" file in Python. Add a socket server, compression, and typed bindings for 20+ languages. Boom. Kafka. Don't oversell it. Need to delete a row? Congratulations, you selected the wrong tool. It's appending JSON lines to a file. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue. To your point about Postgres, I've found Postgres has fantastic JSONB support and awesome developers who have been very influential in my life and whom I admire. Postgres is my preferred cold storage, which I connect to Kafka. It feels like swimming upstream because RMDBs are traditionally for normalized data, not denormalized JSON lines that make XML look hip again. If you have a choice in DB, Postgres' JSONB has helped me avoid unnecessary normalization steps. It's good to have options. ZeroMQ would call this the Titanic pattern and mic drop because the guide has a section on it. That's why I like ZeroMQ. Edit: Apologies for typos/brevity. I have an ancient phone that only works with 20% of the web and phone apps. There are no apps or LLMs to help this dyslexic soul. Reference for the Titanic pattern. The guide's author is cynical about me shoving spinning rust in the middle, but it doesn't say no. https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter4/#Disconnected-Reliab... reply",

          "text": "It's important to distinguish between the use cases. Queues, streams, logs, databases, etc. are different kinds of tools you can use, and what the right tool is depends on your semantics. For example: Message queues are good for work that must be done in strict order where you want to deal with one message at a time. They aren't such a great fit for large batch movement of data, like logs or high volume events, because having a per-message acknowledgement state requires a lot of round trips over the network that simply isn't needed; you want to treat the entire bulk of the flow to carve out big chunks of it, because CPUs wnd networks and disks are more efficient when doing the same operation over large amounts of data in one go. If you are executing \"tasks\" (like image processing, ML inference, webhooks), ordering by insertion order might not be the right choice, either. Sometimes you want to coalesce (dedupe by key). Sometimes you want to ensure the processing for a key (e.g. a customer ID) is done in the same process and not randomly distributed over all your workers. Sometimes you want delivery to be strictly sequential, requiring an exclusive worker rather than massively parallel fan-out. And so on. Where I work, we use a mix of things depending on the application. I am a big fan of NATS. It's not itself a message queue, but its primitives can be combined to handle all sorts of behaviors. Core NATS is more like ephemeral pub/sub, while Jetstream gives you durable, highly available Kafka-like streams. I like combining queues with database state. Use the queue as an efficient way to order items (like jobs or events) for massively scalable distribution, and use the database to store the current state of things. For example, imagine you're delivering webhook messages. We first store the message in the database with the state \"pending\", then write an event to the queue about it. The worker receives the event, double-checks its state is still \"pending\", then executes it. If delivered, mark as \"done\" and ack the message. Otherwise, mark as \"failed\" and create a new queue message to retry. This way, you have durable state in a solid database, and the queue is an efficient way to coordinate the workers. (There's a bit more work here to ensure consistency, but this is the gist of it.) Core NATS is fantastic as a communication primitive between ephemeral processes. You can use it for RPC, for lightweight broadcasts (e.g. reload config everywhere), even for things like leases or caching or similar. Jetstream is like Kafka but more flexible; for example, each message has a wildcard subject that can be filtered on, so different consumers can very efficiently filter a big, commingled stream by interest. In Jetstream streams, messages have per-consumer ack/nack state in addition to a position, so you're not limited to Kafka's linear \"position\". Overall, a superb data model, and very easy to manage as infra. One weak point with NATS is a maximum message size of 10MB. This means that you sometimes have to invent your own chunking if your application needs to send larger payloads. Doing this opens up some cans of worms, so I honestly wouldn't recommend it. For large batch stuff, Redpanda is a better option. reply",

Romanian is much more expressive and precise than English on matters pertaining to housekeeping and farming (peasant activities in general), whereas English is by a mile more suited and expressive in upper-class discourse (negotiations and reasoning of a more abstract or theoretical form; subtle social dynamics). I think to some extent because say Romanian biases heavily towards agriculture in its lexicon, it is an inherent impediment to try to achieve great scientific discoveries in such a language, whereas English or Chinese are evidently better suited. perhaps this raises the question then of wether a globalised language like English would offer greater fairness and freedom of expression, or wether composite languages are for emerge to eg take advantage of German technicality with English managerial interdynamics and French artistry (English already borrows heavily from French and Latin, and is a Germanic language to begin with so is that why it's now the global default language? is it because it's already a semi-composite language?) reply",

          "text": "Chinese can't invent new words. It's really difficult to invent new characters holding the new meaning one wants to express. For example the word computer 电脑 (Dian nao) consist of the word for electric/electricity and the word brain. Both together gives the meaning \"computer\". While English, German, and other 130 languages I googled, somehow represent the verb \"to compute / to calculate\" .. in Chinese it's the \"electronic brain\".. the calculator is then ji suan ji (计算机) -> calculating machine. The other things you mentioned are pure cultural influenced. Like \"the Chinese is better suited to achieve great scientific discussions\" which is actually achieved by accumulation of knowledge and learning. Another example, the best mathematicians are in France, Russia.., ..., and US by most. Gambia also has \"one\" mathematician.. while English being official. Shouldn't then there be more Gambian mathematicians? ... It's \"culture\" preventing the accumulation of knowledge, or, at least not teaching it amongst the pupils. reply",

          "text": "Latin had no word equivalent to the English \"yes\".  Latin had sic which is very close to the English this , which means to speak in the affirmative requires a relation that qualifies an affirmation. As a result thinking in Latin is absolutely different than thinking in English which has yes/no questions that could not exist in Latin.  When asked a yes/no question without receiving a yes or no answer English speakers immediately assume deception and that assumption is almost always correct.  The exception is when the answering party fully fails to grasp the question, or the question's intent if the question is vague or itself deceptive.  In Latin language answers without a yes or no were the default and even though there is not an option to apply a direct yes or no answer many times deception was none the less assumed regardless due to differing cultural norms, especially in elevated classes. https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/how-do-you-sa... https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/questions reply",

          "text": "I would postulate a counterthesis that its not the language we speak that affects the way we think, but rather how much of that language we use and how much the (single) language is capable to express AND how much of different topics we read/hear (in that language). Just think of kids not so profound in their language - they think, they reason, but they can't argue about \"to be or not to be...\". But when they grow up, they more and more use and read other topics that utilize higher parts of the language, difficult sentences, etc.. -> so they LEARN and start to think differently on topics. so, my postulation is: the knowledge we gain shapes our thinking. Language itself is the transportation medium for the knowledge. Is the medium is small, so the knowledge described with the medium is also \"small\" or \"not destinctive enough\". We can use a \"second\" language then to make the knowledge more exact and mor destinct/tdefined. But the knowledge can also be gained with other means - learning by doing, as exmaple. So, a language is not necessary to gain knowledge (numb and deaf and blind people also think, but are somehow limited in their expression ...) so based on that, I postulate, it's a coincidence when a language shapes our thinking, but the cause and the \"affecting part\" is the real \"knowledge-transfer\" by the language.

For example, in one of the languages I speak, husban and wife literally means owner and woman. So a woman would say that he is her owner, while the man would say that she is his woman. Some languages have different “you” meanings. There is a “you” for someone you know, a formal “you”, a “you” when addressing someone older than yourself. While these things sound minor, I do believe they shape the thinking of individuals and societies.

The apparatus of our minds which shape our thoughts are a technology. You shaping your thoughts is just as distinctive as your voice shaping your words. Many have a wide range of variability. There are many influences. The technology of thought in our minds changes a great deal about who we are and how we interface with the world (more than just words and people.) What is useful is not which language, for every modern language is mature through countless generations “polishing” it. What is useful is how much experience one has, and how they might articulate how this was processed.

          "text": "may be it's the personal evolvement, that leads to that? One who have or is living abroad for a few years also develops himself in certain ways. Just like with the students who did study abroad. They show, they gain the competence of self-care-taking-in-a-foreign-environment and problem-solving-skills, more than the ones who studied and lived comfortable (often at parent's home). I speak five languages myself. Being born and grown up in one country, went to highschool in second country, studied in a third country. But it's not the languages, but rather what i've learned and the discussions I had, that shaped the today's me. If I didn't study or argue with others, I would less utilize my thinking-as-an-engineer -> clear & aim-oriented, logically structured problem solving. I notice the use of logical thinking in my daily life (if -> then -> but why? -> conclusion) even more after I started programming in spare time. Yes, it's a new language: strict, well defined, clear expression and problem-modeling. The new language did not change my thinking, but rather the way it solved my problems, and the new knowledge of e.g. data structures, did. So, for me, language is a tool for unlocking the knowledge and the knowledge shapes me. another examples that supports my thinking \"its the knowledge that shapes us\":\n- when the war in Ukraine started, a lot of people said \"We have. Give them long-range missles. Give them now.\". But after learning that for some long-range missles it's neccessary to continiously monitor & control the missle with propriatary technology. This technology is secure and difficult to operate and rather shouldn't fall into the hands of enemies - the thinking about \"give them\" changed. But not the language. - Trump's imposed tariffs: Quite a lot of US thinks the tariffs are paid by the producers. After learning, its paid by the importer, they change their thinking too. Language didn't change. But their thinking. so, I'm opposed to the theory that language alone shapes our thinking. It's the knowledge we gain and the links and conclusions we make. Language is static, while knowledge is dynamic. reply",

          "text": "I'm with you on this. The best sign for language shaping us is right in front of our eyes: out kids going to school and peu au peu learning new words, while gaining new insights and knowledge. The higher the language they use, the more grown up they seem. But, in the meantime they also learned concepts and how to use that. So, language is just a vehicle to transport knowledge, while knowledge is possibly cultural tangled, in my thoughts. Once I experienced such thing while teaching students: there was a group of 6 + 1 Ninjagirls (headscarfed, traditional clothing without skin visible). The one of seven was not wearing headscarf, but rather non-body-pronounced, ordinary clothes, but still covering skin. So, being a man myself, the 7 girls always kept distance to me, while I explained the technical subject. So, when it was about hands-on practice, a possibility to examine the partly finished product has been loudly used by 6 of 7:  They warmed up and where happy smiling discussing the topic furiously among each other and me. Except that one girl. She was standing there and thinking and just looking at what we've produced. I noticed that and of course approached her with \"why don't you participate in the discussion. It's important for gathering understanding. Do you have questions?\" She was like: \"I don't understand this. ... How does it exercise an influence on vibration inducement in the finished product?\" I was blown away by the question. Not because it's a difficult question, but rather because in 14y of teaching, no one - no student, no professors, no workers - literally, no one, has thoughts on vibration inducement at this half-finished state. It doesn't make sense to ask it. It's \"too late to\" and \"too early to\" at the same time.. So I, lost my words, said \"Why do you ask this? I mean, I will be very happy to explain it to you, but please, let your conmilitones first finish their discussion.\" .. so, I explained it to her in the way she built up the understanding to answer her own question by herself. I was so blown away by this, that I approached her after and asked her again \"why did you ask it.. I'm very happy about it. In my 14y of doing this...\" and closed it with \"Keep up what ever you've were thinking. Don't let anyone tell you what to do or what to think or learn. I know, you're really special given the situation today..\" And you guess, that gave her a push in her self esteem. Such a big one, that she changed her style to short skirts, open wonderful hair and a lot of makeup and other girly-things over the next few months. She went literally from Zero to Bomb in 3 months. Also did her engagement in studying change. She enjoyed being smart then. Nice story, I like to tell. Thinking changed. No other language involved. But here, it's more of the \"culture thing\" than knowledge, as you said. Culture, by itself, influences the language and words used. In a patriarchal society the word \"emancipation\" is not used often. Agreed. Learning emancipation in a third language doesn't change the thinking towards emancipation. But knowledge of other women living a self-determined life does provoke thinking over the own situation. Culture shapes behavior, behavior shapes language, language expresses accumulated social knowledge and back-fluences culture :) reply",

SourceHut, I don't use as much as I'd like, but the build and chat services keeps me paying. It's cheap, and I get a lot of enjoyment from using it. I think if you do these types of services, then you really need to make sure that people feel good about using your service. I know that's a tricky and rather fluffy goal, but you either need to be REALLY good and then you can charge more than $5, or you can make people feel good and if the amount is low, it becomes an easy renewal next month/year. If you're making a tool, fixed price for the current version, upgrade price for the next version, no subscription. I think we're at a point in time where your target audience would rather fork over $25 right now and then get a license, but would be hard press to give you $5 per month, even for a single month. reply",

The App Store model of small one-off payments works for this use-case. But no matter how useful a web tool is I don’t think I’d ever sign up for a small monthly fee for it. The ”mental overhead” of that is absolutely massive. Sadly even one off payments for web tools are a poor UX since there is no central broker to take care of it. Next time I visit I (maybe a different browser etc) it’s a hassle. I’d much rather just use a worse tool that is free. Because SaaS fatigue is real. Sorry hobbyists and startup dreamers I’m not paying money for your SaaS. Not because it’s not good enough but because it’s nearly impossible to be good enough to make me go through a subscription process. Even as an older person who can afford it and is used to paying for things, I’d much rather waste hours of my own time than pay a subscription. Importantly, I’d also much rather pay $100 once than $5/mo even if I don’t foresee using it for more than a year. Make it an App Store app and you can easily get $10 from me though, is the sad reality of it. reply",

I'm a sample of one but I avoid /mth pricing for most stuff if I can and prefer annual. Maybe me but the 'another monthly subscription' feels annoying as much as I respect I want this for my own business. Will almost always start using free first then pay if its business beneficial to feature enrich of scale. I think your best focusing on free and getting users. Once you hit a threshold you can ask for some $$ and some people will feel that's reasonable. If you start paid I suspect you'll have little chance of growth unless you come out with something truly amazing. reply",

          "text": "As another commenter said, $5 is a terrible price. $5 a month works for apps with huge user bases and they just take the small conversion and that makes their business run. And this is never web apps (certainly not new ones because the easy ones already exist). If you charge $30-$100 a month you have to find 10 times less people which is way way easier for a small web dev. Yes the problem you solve will have to be more acute but a. There are actually loads of rich people out there - more than you think and b. You now basically only have to build for your most committed users.

          "text": "I've been paying a premium subscription to Focumon ( https://www.focumon.com/ ) for a year and a month. It's a small Pokémon themed productivity tool that I found promoted here on this site. The paid subscription doesn't really give you much, but is inexpensive and I want to support the creator. Small web tools have some advantages that could make them sustainable as a business model. Off the top of my head, some of these are: * Creators are way more reachable, they often get back to you directly when you send them feedback. Sometimes, even, you get to have longer conversations with them too. * You have more impact on what the product evolves into. It's also likely that you get some minor features added if you ask for them. * Smaller tools are able to resist against enshittification with less of an effort. Doesn't mean that it may not happen, of course. If you're asking this because you want to create a small web tool, I'd say the best advice you could use is to make something you like, make it reliable, and be proactive in engaging with you clients / let them reach out easily, demonstrating that you can and will listen and care about their concerns. And if you create something you're proud of and have value, feel more than welcome of posting it here! reply",

          "text": "I think you are asking the right question here. Before building something determine if there is a market, and if that market will pay. Personally my gut says no. I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm more interested in multi-use simple tools. For example, an app that solves a common small problem/inconvenience really well is probably worth $5/mo (I would probably pay for that), but I can't imagine anyone just buys subscriptions to indie apps haha. I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

There's almost always room for something better, and if what you build is that, then some people will pay. Unless the tools have large running costs, consider offering them for free (at least at first). A few things are likely to happen: Nobody cares enough to sign up – fine, zero users, zero costs. People use it but don’t stick around – ask them what would make the tool more valuable. People use it a lot – great, now you can charge for the value. Two examples come to mind: spaced repetition app Mochi and markdown editor Typora. Mochi is $5 a month, I think. Typora was free and is now a $15 one-time purchase.

Cool travel collaboration things were probably old hat when I was working on one [1] in 2005. :P I left the travel industry in 2011, but if any of my knowledge still applies, and you want to make some money... you need to do things to drive hotel bookings. You probably need a catalog of hotels and places to visit anyway to help users plan things. But make sure you have a way for your users to book those hotels and you to get a commission. Make sure you're making landing pages for people to find with search engines. You'll probably want/need to pay to get people into those same landing pages, so you'll need to be tracking revenue at a very granular level, so you can bid higher on the pages that make you more money, and less (or not at all) on the pages that don't. And if you're in multiple commission programs (which you should be), you can be sure to highlight the ones that make you more money. You may want to have something t help your users make airplane and car bookings too, but those margins are slim, so work on hotels first. [1] https://lifehacker.com/yahoo-trip-planner-100875 reply",

          "text": "Thank you for the thoughtful pushback. This is exactly the kind of discussion I was hoping for. I totally agree that FOSS + support can be a great model in the right context. We’re definitely not trying to reinvent DRM or lock users out of their own systems without recourse. Here’s how we think about it: Many developers building self-hosted tools try to monetize in good faith, especially when selling to large enterprises. But they often lose control over renewals, never-ending trials, and multiple unlicensed deployments. The current model: Send a zip or Docker file and hope, just doesn’t scale. Kage isn’t about locking software down. It’s about helping developers protect and grow the value of what they’ve built, without needing to write custom scripts or chase invoices. Think of it more like Stripe or Terraform Cloud for licensing and compliance, not DRM or spyware. That said, false positives are a real risk, and we’ve designed Kage to be graceful by default: - Licenses include grace periods, pre-expiration alerts, and non-blocking modes. - You can configure what happens when a license expires from “notify only” to “disable premium features” or “shut down in sandbox environments.” - It’s all transparent and developer-controllable. We’re also open-sourcing key parts of the platform (CLI tools, SDKs, deployment templates) to make it auditable and community-driven. Our goal is to give developers more tools, not take control away from users. Would love to hear more about what a fair and developer-friendly enforcement system looks like to you (or others here). We’re building this for developers first, and that means getting it right. reply",

          "text": "IMO the \"sales/businesses\" magic was they billed a high-ish hourly rate for every single minute from start to end of the task however their assistant defined it from their perspective, even during the downtime waiting for stuff to happen while they made a few phone calls and outsourced the help to either occur or get set up.  This is not expensive for stuff that they can set up fast from start to end, but could adds up a lot if the assistant needs to babysit a multi-hour process for you, IIRC. It's possible that other people had other experiences.  But I don't think they were starting a clock, doing stuff, then stopping the clock when just waiting for responses from third parties.  It was more like start clock, get stuff done until it's all done or set up with no further input needed, then stop the clock.  Which is ok, but is not the real magic I originally assumed might make it really efficient as a user (and efficient as a task-orchestration assistant). The real magic was you interfaced with them simply, by text message, to achieve whatever the goal was, after signing up and being \"accepted\".  The simplicity and flexibility of what the assistant could do, so long as you could pay the bill (whatever they outsourced for you plus their own charge), was what it was worth. Go to web page, put in phone number and billing info, and agree to the terms/rate.  Get magic # to text when you need assistance. Text # when you need it.  Clock starts.  Get help squared way.  Pretty low effort, they could help with a lot. I don't know what the tech was in the background, there was nothing magic about it AFAICT.  Maybe Google Docs/Sheets.  Or, an Asana instance + Wiki + Slack could take care of some assistant doing a task and documenting it for reference, building knowledge of how to get what done.  You could use the Issues in Gitea if you want open source, I guess. As I understand it, Magic the YC company thought they could collect data on what people need and automate the common stuff but I remember reading that that never materialized and they pivoted.  Frankly the current offering looks more complicated now at https://getmagic.com/how-it-works/ and truly the magic as an offering to the customer was the simplicity and flexibility. So for the OP, offer a single SMS number your people can text to get answers or get something done, hiding all the operational detail whatever it is.  Obviously, SMS is insecure, so whatever your SSO chat system is at work would be the replacement. Or a single QR code to get started with the \"do anything\" chat assistant, and equally strong branding. But a simple, familiar, \"do anything for me\" interface was the idea. I'll say this, to Magic's credit.  They helped me get sh* done that I was really putting off and was really too focused on other things for, and that I needed some help just getting done.  And they got it done for me.  Thanks, YC and Magic.  It's still a good idea. reply",

          "text": "I think this type of question is, roughly, backwards. If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

I do have a 1 week free trial for anyone who signs up and finds out they dont have a next gen firewall that accepts threatfeeds. Webinars and live demos to who? MSSP partnership?

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "Hi! I have a WIP of this over at https://talktrainer.app/ -- I just added Dutch to it. It uses OpenAI's realtime API to simulate either a tutoring session (the speaker will revert to English to help you) or a first date or business meeting (the speaker will always speak the target language) You can see the AI's transcriptions but not your own, limitation of the current OpenAI API but definitely something I can fix. The prompts are like this: https://gist.github.com/jc4p/d8b9d121425ec191d62602d8720eeed... and the rest of it is a Nextjs app wrapped around the WebRTC connection. I'm not fully in love with the app so I'd love any feedback or hearing if it works well for you -- It doesn't have a lot of features yet (including saving context) and if you bump into the time limit just open it up in incognito to keep going. reply",

Maybe some more tourist-related scenarios, like \"ordering at restaurant\", \"resolving dispute about rental car crash\" etc? :-) The \"next level\" feature would be to get it to speak even simpler, with some hints about how to reply, for the beginners. I don't know how that would ideally look, but maybe a button to pop up some \"key words\" or phrases that one could use? (Even so, I found myself using the little I know, so it's obviously somehow working even though my knowledge is extremely basic.)

But I didn’t see a Help page to clarify how I’m “supposed” to interact. Eg I tried saying in English “I don’t understand” (even though I know how to say that in Spanish) and it responded in Spanish which may be hard for absolute beginners.

While the transcription is technically in the API it's not a native part of the model and runs through Whisper separately, in my testing with it I often end up with a transcription that's a different language than what the user is speaking and the current API has no way to force a language on the internal Whisper call. If the language is correct, a lot of the times the exact text isn't 100% accurate, if that's 100% accurate, it comes in slower than the audio output and not in real time. All in all not what I would consider feature ready to release in my app. What I've been thinking about is switching to a full audio in --> transcribe --> send to LLM --> TTS pipeline, in which case I would be able to show the exact input to the model, but that's way more work than just one single OpenAI API call. reply",

It's also rather challenging because I'm doing two things at once and the hope is that I won't actually spend much brain power overthinking my responses - something I tend to do if I was talking to myself instead which typically turns into more of a rehearsal format. reply",

          "text": "I'm trying to solve the problem of unlimited conversation practice for various languages with \"CallAnnie\", an iOS/android app with various kind of AI friends, powered by real time voice and avatars. The interface is specifically made for advanced learners that want to simulate a conversation as close as possible to a real one (in terms of latency and without pushing any button). Learning to respond fast in a new language is important, so we're trying to keep a natural pace. We support audio or video-calling the characters (with subtitle translations), guided conversations and we recently added mini games to learn vocabulary. You can see a quick intro and demo video here: https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1013961 We don't have a Dutch speaking character in the default character list, but you can follow this link https://app.callannie.ai/a/mhLnHflAyf1Ygb0D0wm6 after installing the app to use a custom character speaking Dutch (or you can create a custom character). If you'd like to try it, check out: callannie.ai . \nI would love to get your feedback (here or francesco a t callannie.ai) and suggestions - we're trying to solve this speaking practice use case. reply",

Dutch is not supported yet, and there are still some rough edges. But the idea is simple: help people remember words by using them. You say or type something, and get a reply you can hear or read. In conversations on IF, there is no fixed path. You can start with a topic, then ask to switch to something else. It’s meant to be low-pressure and flexible. Still figuring things out.

If yes, just do it. to many people it is endearing if you are struggling with a language. And if they don't like it they probably just don't like talking to you in general so learned or not doesn't matter.

          "text": "Perhaps it's not a success story, but I have a definite improvement story. I find accepting and making peace with my problems (paradoxically) helps improve the problem. I am going through a particularly low dip right now. I haven't done any work in the last 4 days.  I tried a 4 minute pomodoro timer yesterday and 2 minutes in I was already completely off task. In the past I would panic, worry, think \"Why me and my terrible executive function?\" or \"What if I can never do anything again ever\".  Instead I am accepting that this is the issue I have and keeping a curious, open mind to possible solutions. I'm trying out taking longer breaks, changing up my workspace, body doubling, nutrition, timers, not trying to do anything etc. I'm sure it will swing back the other way in its own time. Of course I would love to be able to be consistently able to work, but that is not a reality for me. In the same way I would love to be able to run 100m in 9.6 seconds but that is also just not realistic. Other comments here are good too: eat well, sleep enough, exercise regularly. This is a good baseline to have but these things alone never fixed my issues. reply",

One thing that's worked for me is therapy focusing on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Essentially, you identify your goals and values, and then reframe your thinking to question whether what you're doing aligns with those goals and values. Depending on what you struggle with, try batching tasks. I used to have a long list of things to remember to do regularly (wash up, clear the bench, put the kids' toys away, etc.), and I would often ignore it because it became annoying. All I did was change it to a plain note that I can look at and see if the task was completed, and eventually those tasks became a habit. reply",

          "text": "Couple things... 'Sticking to a task' is an emotional problem not a willpower problem. Often times uncomfortable activities prompt us to switch to something else less painful in the moment. Eg, 'I don't want to write this email (because I will potentially say something dumb and be judged)' can be alleviated by playing mobile game (now I don't feel the discomfort of writing the email). 'Everything's falling apart' -> There is a tendency to point towards the extremes in this comment (and others). You would need to speak to a licensed professional to get a full diagnosis with proper treatment (lots of underlying conditions that can be associated with this). However, in general Id recommend a couple things: \n1) Focus on getting enough sleep, eating properly and meeting your other human needs: connection, purpose, stability. \n2) Focus on building empathy with both others and yourself. Focus on why other people do things that aren't perfect, accept that. Focus on why you do things that aren't perfect, accept that. It seems weird. Like why do I have to smile at someone who wrongs me. They don't deserve it. However, executive disfunction is an emotional issue. There's not any one trick that will solve it. To do well as a human your subconscious needs to know that your conscious will meet your needs. When that doesn't happen it will take over whatever you 'think' you should be doing and lead you to do something else. Getting back in touch with your executive function means getting back in touch with what your body subconsciously needs. Practically, I would recommend these concrete actions: \n1) Focus on a consistent wake up time, this is easiest if you commit to something else in your life that requires you to be present.  \n2) Focus on having at least one healthy meal a day. \n3) Do at least 20 minutes of physical activity a day. This can be as simple as walking to the donut shop and eating a donut.\n4) Make a log of what you do instead when you fail to do a task. Review it without judgement. reply",

          "text": "Ok, yeah, my underlying cause was everything. I had a bad case of everything bad that can happen happening at the same time (except personal death). Both my parents had previously died in my twenties and yet this period of time in my life was 10x harder than that in terms of grief and turmoil, I reverted to a child like state and had constant intrusive wishes that I could just lay my head on my moms lap and cry but of course I couldn't. My cognitive capacity dropped so low that even my speech became nearly monosyllabic. The feeling of being depressed switched to the point where I was in a constant fog and I really felt like I was a passenger to the depression, like I no longer had depression but depression had me. I was going to a therapist at the time who was very good and very expensive and he was quite clear about the need for intervention and to take things seriously. I had also recently stumbled across this paper: https://www.jcdr.net/articles/PDF/6186/13392_CE%28RA1%29_F%2... so even though I had depression my primary concern was the severity that had led to my cognitive decline. I really didn't want to go on anti-depressants but I was willing to do so, I made a deal with my therapist that I would commit to biking every single day for the 3 weeks between sessions and if I didn't stick to that commitment I would start a prescription. My dad had a terrible bout with depression when I was a teenager, caused by some very serious betrayal in business dealings by a close friend, for a time he didn't get out of bed, that short period of time spiraled our family life out of control and materially destroyed my life trajectory which took me decades of hard work to crawl out of because I started supporting our family full time at 15 out of necessity, because this was pre ACA and we had a lapse in coverage during which my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I won't go into the details here but basically I loved my dad but always felt a deep anger/rage at this period of not getting out of bed. So no matter what I would get out of bed. I got on my road bike and biked twenty miles a day every day as hard as I could, I took a route that was ten miles and I left nothing for the ride back, then I would ride back, this was in the Texas August heat, I would drink 2 gallons of water and had to keep an ice bottle to keep my head cool, I rode like some sort of doomed machine trying to tear my own limbs apart. For two weeks I did this, with no improvement, on my bike I would cry and sing (because of that pdf) like some kind of psycho barreling towards hell, because I have heart defects I am on medication that blocks adrenaline so there wasn't even a runners high and the first 30 minutes of riding I always felt like lead as my heart took time to keep up with the exertion (that is still and will always be the case for me). On the 16th day, after my ride, my mental fog lifted for one hour as i flipped back into the driver seat, i was still depressed but _I_ was depressed. I never went on anti-depressants, the facts of my life were still what they were and everything fell apart and my whole life changed radically and permanently and I lost so much of everything a person can lose. But after 45 days of continuing to just get out of bed and step on my bike every single day, and singing and raging and just absolutely sounding nuts on this 20 mile ride in 90+ degree heat I finally had my first FULL day where I was depressed but my mind was working and the depression was no longer in the driver seat for the entire day. And the whole thing felt impossible at each step, but really all it was was mechanically getting out of bed, getting my feet on my bike pedals and biking far enough away that I was finished but I still had to bike back. I couldn't have done it on a treadmill, I couldn't have done it in a pool, I had to push myself as hard as I could. Fortunately on a bike 20 miles was two hours at first and later an hour. reply",

No followers. Mutual connections only. Put a strict limit of 1000 connections in place to enforce this. No one actually has a mutual connection with more than 1000 people. This only hurts people trying to gain an audience. Heck, make it so if you haven't read someone else's posts in a year, they stop seeing yours. Do whatever it takes to prevent one-to-many connections. 2. No public content. No one wants the whole world to read their conversations with their friends. The only reason you would want that is if you want to build an audience. 3. No likes. No scores of any kind. If you show people a number, they will try to make it go up. No one tracks a score with their friends. 4. No newsfeed. Don't reward people for never shutting up. Maybe a chronological list of *friends* by most recent update and click into that to see all their updates. 5. No algorithm. Give people tools to find what they want to see; don't try to decide for them. 6. No re-post, no share, no forward, etc. Content lives in one place only, the account of the person who posted it, and it is only visible to who they said it should be visible to. reply",

I agree with most of these, but I'm iffy on this one. \"No one tracks a score with their friends\" is not really true, it makes people feel good to see encouragement and feedback from their friends. There's no reason that encouragement has to be restricted to text comments and messages. Without feedback, you're essentially just screaming into the void knowing someone could be listening. If the things I'm posting could get feedback but don't, that tells me that the things I'm saying aren't really hitting with any of my friends. That's a valuable thing to know, whether or not you choose to act on it. Facebook in the early years was for the most part exactly like what you are suggesting, but with likes, and I at least remember it being a pretty enjoyable place for a few years there (I joined at the very end of 2006). reply",

          "text": "\"Hitting\" with any of your friends is precisely the type of interaction I want to suppress. The way you know if what you say to your friends in real life is interesting to them is if they engage with it. If your feedback mechanism is anything other than the other side of a mutually interesting conversation, you probably aren't having ordinary conversation with friends. What real life feedback mechanisms most closely resembles likes? Applause. Who applauds? An audience. Friends *can* give non-verbal cues in real life that they are interested (nodding, laughing, etc.), but likes are very much not like those non-verbal cues. Non-verbal cues only work in a very small group. There is no non-verbal cue that works to show interest in the context of \"any of your friends\" in real life. Emoji reactions in the context of a back-and-forth chat could work as non-verbal cues, but again, those are very different from drive-by likes with no additional engagement. In this hypothetical social network, if you post something and no one responds to it or engages with it in any way verbally, you would be encouraged to do the same thing you would do in real life if you kept trying to talk about something in a group of friends and no one engaged with it verbally... find something else to talk about (or find a different group for that topic). The goal is very much to mirror the experience of talking to your friends, but facilitated in a way that makes it more asynchronous and scalable (within the limit of your actual real life connections). There are a lot of people in my life I would love to stay better connected with, but maintaining a direct chat can be difficult (what to say) and it doesn't always make sense to put people in group chats because the group might only make sense to me (people I used to work with that I actually like, for example). If I could post about what's going on in my life, what I'm working on, what I'm into right now, etc. and have my real-life friends opt-in to an actual conversation about that... well then it's much easier to stay in touch. I have no interest in knowing how many of my friends \"like\" what I'm sharing. If we aren't mutually talking to each other, we aren't engaging as friends no matter how much they may like it. They're just my audience if they have nothing to say back. Sorry I didn't have time to make this shorter. My goal isn't to convince anyone of anything, just to share a perspective that might be interesting to you, OP or anyone else building something \"social\". You might sum it all up with the question: What if social media tried to be as much like real life friendship and as little like \"influencing\" as possible? reply",

But if I could see the occasional (low frequency) update on things in their life or interesting to them... I could maybe see an opportunity to reach out for a real conversation about something of mutual interest. Imagine you're suddenly teleported to a party with a hundred people you know and like but aren't super close to. How do you join a conversation? I mean, if it was people you were really close to, you'd just go up and talk to someone. That's group chat / SMS. But if it's more aquaintence level... one of two things probably happens: You overhear something that you're interested in and connect on that, or you randomly drop in various conversations at a surface level until something clicks. That's what I'm after. Conversation that naturally flows from a spark. You don't need that with your closest friends, but you don't need a social network to keep up with your closest friends either. I imagine social networking as the tool to provide ongoing sparks for real direct interactive conversations on an occasional but ongoing basis with people you aren't close enough to to just call/text. reply",

Beyond that, I’m not even sure if being able to post things is worth it. Status updates such as relationship status and job might be worth it. But text content? Hmm. I fear it devolves into politics and other low quality discussion quickly. The modern Facebook brings out the worst in some of the best people I know. Sometimes we shouldn’t share our opinions so freely until we’ve thought about them more and refined them. I guess that’s what made Google+ interesting.

Really hard to build a business around, I know. But in NYC there are all these recent trends of run clubs, reading groups (events where people bring a book to a cozy location and collectively read with some mood lighting), and similar community-esque events that don't require anyone to interact but offer a forum for those that want it to happen. I was talking last night with a friend about dinner party services, which arrange for themed dinners, and we were saying how we would be interested in that but we wouldn't want to just meet random strangers, there would have to be some sort of draw to a theme or an interest group; otherwise we would just host with our own friends in our own networks.

It’s all about network effects and if users can’t send their post to all friends, they’ll just move on to a different platform - chronological friends only feed is really boring. Not that it’s bad per de, but it’s hard to convince people to stay if the service is not entertaining It can also be me not being able to market the project right. Good luck with your attempt!

To make a fact-checking machine you have to make a god, but to detect outrage and negativity you just need ModernBERT, BiLSTM and maybe 20,000 training examples.  It is true that outrage engages people but take that away and you will find there are wholesome things like cat photos that go viral.  How you suppress negativity is up to you, and people will always say that their negativity is their free speech, but detecting negativity in 2005 is mostly a matter of making the training set. reply",

I never understood why we have to remove one thing to do something else. Sometimes you just need a redirection right? I mean sure, GPS was meant for missile guidance, but now we use it to go to our friends place for game night or taking the family on a road trip. The internet wasn't made for memes, but here we are. And we play online games together too. We spend like 1-2 trillion on medicaid and medicare. My personal vision (which may differ obviously from others) is for America to be the best nation to ever exist, in terms of what it offers to its citizens, and to the broader community at large. And for me that includes the best military power (gotta keep the insane crazy countries and terry's in check), the best social quality of life (healthcare, housing, safety), and the best outcomes for everyone who is here (pursuit of happiness). I find it fascinating that this country has gone through hell and back (civil war, civil rights, world wars, etc.) and held it together, and it is one of the primary reasons I admire the country so much even though it has its issues (which country doesn't?) and aspires for something greater. For someone like me, Europe can be a very racist place and I know from first hand accounts from others like me how they're treated as an eternal outsider, not to mention their imperialist history and bloodshed... Where I'm from is a 3rd world developing country that was set back by invaders and imperialists for centuries. America offers a balance that is really hard to find in the world, it is a true melting pot and I love it here. reply",

          "text": "Curation instead of moderation. The worst thing about running a content hosting platform is moderation. You will fail at it, and that failure will hurt people. Even worse, you replace success with victory. The first move is to let your users help, by giving them the power to moderate their own spaces. Of course, as every web forum (and subreddit) has proven, this isn't a perfect solution. Even the best moderation can never be enough. Moderated spaces become echo chambers that war with one another. That's because power will always be abused for rent seeking. In the case of moderation, that means moderators abusing their authority to monopolize engagement; and narrative converging into dualist team-speak. So what if we eliminate the hierarchy? Instead of letting a moderator decide what content shouldn't be seen, let users collaboratively decide what content they want to see. Every published interaction is an attestation. It can be the presence of content itself, or it can be something about content. That might be a category, a logical assertion, an opinion, whatever. By providing a subjective attestation about some content, we can empower users to use boundaries to find content that is interesting, and avoid content that is undesirable. Users could choose the curated lists they trust, and collaborate on consensus. Objective truth does not exist. Everything written is subjected to a specific perspective. By using boundaries instead of rules, we can accommodate this reality as a first class feature of the system. Friends aren't journalists anyway, so the goal of interaction was never objectivity to begin with. By reframing interaction this way, we can have conversations instead of debates; and even if you do want to debate, you can leverage attestations to actually argue constructively. reply",

Here I am in 2025, having had many jobs, many layoffs, some lean years, and facing age discrimination. I ask myself,\nwould I have done worse had I followed my real interest? Cue LLMs eating up all the creative output and upending the market for original, real photography. reply",

A google box running on your local network.  Now there are advanced things like elastic and other search specific technologies that you can use. I think LLMs might follow this market pattern where you can buy something to host yourself and then commoditization happens enough where open source solutions will also evolve to have good enough solutions. An idea for a disrupting company would be to open source their LLM and offer support and feature development to enterprises as the paid offering, kinda like Red Hat or others doing that model. A key difference is running an LLM locally on decent sized compute is fine but it will be costly to scale on your own. reply",

Yes, there's a lot of Open Source, and yes a lot of it is critical, but to see the current state as \"open source \" is not seeing the whole picture. Google us not Open Source. Neither is Gmail, Google Maps etc. Then there's Windows, Office etc. What about AWS. Or iOS. Android is sorta open source, except for all the bits that actually make it useful. And that's before we consider Facebook and friends. Or Netflix. Or Amazon shopping cart. LLMs are following in the footsteps of pretty much every tech company, and every technology - it starts out life being proprietary. Maybe one day not just the software (llama) but the models will also be open source. But no, it doesn't bother me at all. Most all Open Source is built on the ideas of proprietary software. reply",

          "text": "The state of LLMs right now seems analogous to the state of CAD software. There are free options available but they aren't as capable. The good part about this analogy is that the needs of the users aren't very dynamic -- if you are using a CAD software it is for design tasks. The interface may change, but the purpose doesn't. Because of this, the quality gap between free CAD packages and LLMs are natural language models (what words are likely to come next given the context), not any sort of AGI. For that purpose, the gap between open and closed models is closing much faster in LLMs than CAD. I think LLMs will go the way of chess engines -- one of these models will become the Stockfish of LLMs and the proprietary models will end up being a waste of money and resources. reply",

Romanian is much more expressive and precise than English on matters pertaining to housekeeping and farming (peasant activities in general), whereas English is by a mile more suited and expressive in upper-class discourse (negotiations and reasoning of a more abstract or theoretical form; subtle social dynamics). I think to some extent because say Romanian biases heavily towards agriculture in its lexicon, it is an inherent impediment to try to achieve great scientific discoveries in such a language, whereas English or Chinese are evidently better suited. perhaps this raises the question then of wether a globalised language like English would offer greater fairness and freedom of expression, or wether composite languages are for emerge to eg take advantage of German technicality with English managerial interdynamics and French artistry (English already borrows heavily from French and Latin, and is a Germanic language to begin with so is that why it's now the global default language? is it because it's already a semi-composite language?) reply",

Another example, the best mathematicians are in France, Russia.., ..., and US by most. Gambia also has \"one\" mathematician.. while English being official.

Just think of kids not so profound in their language - they think, they reason, but they can't argue about \"to be or not to be...\". But when they grow up, they more and more use and read other topics that utilize higher parts of the language, difficult sentences, etc.. -> so they LEARN and start to think differently on topics. so, my postulation is: the knowledge we gain shapes our thinking. Language itself is the transportation medium for the knowledge. Is the medium is small, so the knowledge described with the medium is also \"small\" or \"not destinctive enough\". We can use a \"second\" language then to make the knowledge more exact and mor destinct/tdefined. But the knowledge can also be gained with other means - learning by doing, as exmaple. So, a language is not necessary to gain knowledge (numb and deaf and blind people also think, but are somehow limited in their expression ...) so based on that, I postulate, it's a coincidence when a language shapes our thinking, but the cause and the \"affecting part\" is the real \"knowledge-transfer\" by the language.

As a result thinking in Latin is absolutely different than thinking in English which has yes/no questions that could not exist in Latin.  When asked a yes/no question without receiving a yes or no answer English speakers immediately assume deception and that assumption is almost always correct.  The exception is when the answering party fully fails to grasp the question, or the question's intent if the question is vague or itself deceptive.  In Latin language answers without a yes or no were the default and even though there is not an option to apply a direct yes or no answer many times deception was none the less assumed regardless due to differing cultural norms, especially in elevated classes. https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/how-do-you-sa... https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/questions reply",

Some languages have different “you” meanings. There is a “you” for someone you know, a formal “you”, a “you” when addressing someone older than yourself. While these things sound minor, I do believe they shape the thinking of individuals and societies.

          "text": "Honestly, not really, no. Speaking as someone who has had a handful of languages at a handful of proficiencies under his belt over his life, I don't really think learning any of them have \"expanded my consciousness\" or anything like that by any considerable degree. Sorry to burst your bubble. I learned English, Spanish, and Latin as a teenager, and currently am about 4 years deep into learning Finnish, so I speak with some lived experience on this. If you want to think interesting thoughts, you need to think hard about things for a long time. That's the sine qua non of it. It can be in any language you want, or even in a nonlinguistic substrate like mental visualization. I would heavily caution people away from trying to shortcut this process by first spending 5 years studying e.g. ancient Assyrian and only then attempting to commune with pre-biblical demons (or whatever it is people think they want to do with this - if there's no particular goal in mind, I would say that's yet another red flag). In general, I'm sorry to say, I think language learning is a tremendous waste of time and effort for almost everybody. Exceptions are mainly for hobbyists (even then, there are probably much more worthwhile hobbies you could take up), passing regulatory hurdles (all of mine so far), and integrating into a new culture (Finnish alone so far). If you want a pastime which will really push your brain to think hard and in new ways, philosophy and mathematics are both much better bang for your buck. reply",

          "text": "may be it's the personal evolvement, that leads to that? One who have or is living abroad for a few years also develops himself in certain ways. Just like with the students who did study abroad. They show, they gain the competence of self-care-taking-in-a-foreign-environment and problem-solving-skills, more than the ones who studied and lived comfortable (often at parent's home). I speak five languages myself. Being born and grown up in one country, went to highschool in second country, studied in a third country. But it's not the languages, but rather what i've learned and the discussions I had, that shaped the today's me. If I didn't study or argue with others, I would less utilize my thinking-as-an-engineer -> clear & aim-oriented, logically structured problem solving. I notice the use of logical thinking in my daily life (if -> then -> but why? -> conclusion) even more after I started programming in spare time. Yes, it's a new language: strict, well defined, clear expression and problem-modeling. The new language did not change my thinking, but rather the way it solved my problems, and the new knowledge of e.g. data structures, did. So, for me, language is a tool for unlocking the knowledge and the knowledge shapes me. another examples that supports my thinking \"its the knowledge that shapes us\":\n- when the war in Ukraine started, a lot of people said \"We have. Give them long-range missles. Give them now.\". But after learning that for some long-range missles it's neccessary to continiously monitor & control the missle with propriatary technology. This technology is secure and difficult to operate and rather shouldn't fall into the hands of enemies - the thinking about \"give them\" changed. But not the language. - Trump's imposed tariffs: Quite a lot of US thinks the tariffs are paid by the producers. After learning, its paid by the importer, they change their thinking too. Language didn't change. But their thinking. so, I'm opposed to the theory that language alone shapes our thinking. It's the knowledge we gain and the links and conclusions we make. Language is static, while knowledge is dynamic. reply",

          "text": "I'm with you on this. The best sign for language shaping us is right in front of our eyes: out kids going to school and peu au peu learning new words, while gaining new insights and knowledge. The higher the language they use, the more grown up they seem. But, in the meantime they also learned concepts and how to use that. So, language is just a vehicle to transport knowledge, while knowledge is possibly cultural tangled, in my thoughts. Once I experienced such thing while teaching students: there was a group of 6 + 1 Ninjagirls (headscarfed, traditional clothing without skin visible). The one of seven was not wearing headscarf, but rather non-body-pronounced, ordinary clothes, but still covering skin. So, being a man myself, the 7 girls always kept distance to me, while I explained the technical subject. So, when it was about hands-on practice, a possibility to examine the partly finished product has been loudly used by 6 of 7:  They warmed up and where happy smiling discussing the topic furiously among each other and me. Except that one girl. She was standing there and thinking and just looking at what we've produced. I noticed that and of course approached her with \"why don't you participate in the discussion. It's important for gathering understanding. Do you have questions?\" She was like: \"I don't understand this. ... How does it exercise an influence on vibration inducement in the finished product?\" I was blown away by the question. Not because it's a difficult question, but rather because in 14y of teaching, no one - no student, no professors, no workers - literally, no one, has thoughts on vibration inducement at this half-finished state. It doesn't make sense to ask it. It's \"too late to\" and \"too early to\" at the same time.. So I, lost my words, said \"Why do you ask this? I mean, I will be very happy to explain it to you, but please, let your conmilitones first finish their discussion.\" .. so, I explained it to her in the way she built up the understanding to answer her own question by herself. I was so blown away by this, that I approached her after and asked her again \"why did you ask it.. I'm very happy about it. In my 14y of doing this...\" and closed it with \"Keep up what ever you've were thinking. Don't let anyone tell you what to do or what to think or learn. I know, you're really special given the situation today..\" And you guess, that gave her a push in her self esteem. Such a big one, that she changed her style to short skirts, open wonderful hair and a lot of makeup and other girly-things over the next few months. She went literally from Zero to Bomb in 3 months. Also did her engagement in studying change. She enjoyed being smart then. Nice story, I like to tell. Thinking changed. No other language involved. But here, it's more of the \"culture thing\" than knowledge, as you said. Culture, by itself, influences the language and words used. In a patriarchal society the word \"emancipation\" is not used often. Agreed. Learning emancipation in a third language doesn't change the thinking towards emancipation. But knowledge of other women living a self-determined life does provoke thinking over the own situation. Culture shapes behavior, behavior shapes language, language expresses accumulated social knowledge and back-fluences culture :) reply",

          "text": "For sure, though not likely how you infer (from the way you stated your reasoning.) Consciousness (existential inflection) and conscious (aware) are two separate things. Consciousness envelops one’s conscious experience, however there is much more (an entire mind technology.) The mechanics of language and their influence on thought is yet another fascinating layer. The apparatus of our minds which shape our thoughts are a technology. You shaping your thoughts is just as distinctive as your voice shaping your words. Many have a wide range of variability. There are many influences. The technology of thought in our minds changes a great deal about who we are and how we interface with the world (more than just words and people.) What is useful is not which language, for every modern language is mature through countless generations “polishing” it. What is useful is how much experience one has, and how they might articulate how this was processed. The technology of the mind may at times seem like an arms race, though it is also like an ouroboros, devouring itself and reinventing through time. reply",

I often forget to read LWN for weeks, but I keep renewing it year after year, because I honestly love taking a few minutes out of my morning, get coffee and read an article or two. SourceHut, I don't use as much as I'd like, but the build and chat services keeps me paying. It's cheap, and I get a lot of enjoyment from using it. I think if you do these types of services, then you really need to make sure that people feel good about using your service. I know that's a tricky and rather fluffy goal, but you either need to be REALLY good and then you can charge more than $5, or you can make people feel good and if the amount is low, it becomes an easy renewal next month/year. If you're making a tool, fixed price for the current version, upgrade price for the next version, no subscription. I think we're at a point in time where your target audience would rather fork over $25 right now and then get a license, but would be hard press to give you $5 per month, even for a single month. reply",

The App Store model of small one-off payments works for this use-case. But no matter how useful a web tool is I don’t think I’d ever sign up for a small monthly fee for it. The ”mental overhead” of that is absolutely massive. Sadly even one off payments for web tools are a poor UX since there is no central broker to take care of it. Next time I visit I (maybe a different browser etc) it’s a hassle. I’d much rather just use a worse tool that is free. Because SaaS fatigue is real. Sorry hobbyists and startup dreamers I’m not paying money for your SaaS. Not because it’s not good enough but because it’s nearly impossible to be good enough to make me go through a subscription process. Even as an older person who can afford it and is used to paying for things, I’d much rather waste hours of my own time than pay a subscription. Importantly, I’d also much rather pay $100 once than $5/mo even if I don’t foresee using it for more than a year. Make it an App Store app and you can easily get $10 from me though, is the sad reality of it. reply",

          "text": "As another commenter said, $5 is a terrible price. $5 a month works for apps with huge user bases and they just take the small conversion and that makes their business run. And this is never web apps (certainly not new ones because the easy ones already exist). If you charge $30-$100 a month you have to find 10 times less people which is way way easier for a small web dev. Yes the problem you solve will have to be more acute but a. There are actually loads of rich people out there - more than you think and b. You now basically only have to build for your most committed users.

          "text": "I've been paying a premium subscription to Focumon ( https://www.focumon.com/ ) for a year and a month. It's a small Pokémon themed productivity tool that I found promoted here on this site. The paid subscription doesn't really give you much, but is inexpensive and I want to support the creator. Small web tools have some advantages that could make them sustainable as a business model. Off the top of my head, some of these are: * Creators are way more reachable, they often get back to you directly when you send them feedback. Sometimes, even, you get to have longer conversations with them too. * You have more impact on what the product evolves into. It's also likely that you get some minor features added if you ask for them. * Smaller tools are able to resist against enshittification with less of an effort. Doesn't mean that it may not happen, of course. If you're asking this because you want to create a small web tool, I'd say the best advice you could use is to make something you like, make it reliable, and be proactive in engaging with you clients / let them reach out easily, demonstrating that you can and will listen and care about their concerns. And if you create something you're proud of and have value, feel more than welcome of posting it here! reply",

          "text": "I think you are asking the right question here. Before building something determine if there is a market, and if that market will pay. Personally my gut says no. I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm more interested in multi-use simple tools. For example, an app that solves a common small problem/inconvenience really well is probably worth $5/mo (I would probably pay for that), but I can't imagine anyone just buys subscriptions to indie apps haha. I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

There's almost always room for something better, and if what you build is that, then some people will pay. Unless the tools have large running costs, consider offering them for free (at least at first). A few things are likely to happen: Nobody cares enough to sign up – fine, zero users, zero costs. People use it but don’t stick around – ask them what would make the tool more valuable. People use it a lot – great, now you can charge for the value. Two examples come to mind: spaced repetition app Mochi and markdown editor Typora. Mochi is $5 a month, I think. Typora was free and is now a $15 one-time purchase. Both compete with free alternatives and still have many paying users. reply",

          "text": "This [0] comment and discussion under it about how non technical businesses are very rarely run by technical people, and how if you apply your technical skills to such a business it can be a force multiplier. Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

I've also internalized things before not realizing how important they are until much later when finding the source is hard/impossible. I can say that HN has had an incredible impact on my life. From being a place to debate/discuss technology and technology-related concepts to a source of news that has given me a edge (IMHO). Even at work I feel starved for that (not enough time and/or people interested in it) but here you can always find a topic to talk about and geek-out on. I am certain there are core personality traits that I picked up or honed due to comments made on this site, I just can't point to a specific one. reply",

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

The really important computing nowadays is all done on the GPU; the CPU is little more than a front-end processor. Furthermore, with AI and LLMs we're rapidly converging on a future where programming won't even resemble programming as we know it. If you're young and talented, the time to get ahead of the game is NOW. I am no longer young, so I will probably be one of the ones left behind. reply",

My personal prime motivator is something like: Help people help themselves.\n   And help those who can't. And yet I largely remain unquestioningly committed to most social services (private, public, personal). If I'm really devoted to feeding the hungry, for instance, I should always remember the proper goal is to end hunger (outright). Even if that goal is unattainable. Maybe because that goal is unattainable. Which leads to a deeper inspection of the root causes, moral foundations, social context, etc. It's just so easy to get caught up in the immediate necessity and lose site of root causes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",

The prompts are like this: https://gist.github.com/jc4p/d8b9d121425ec191d62602d8720eeed... and the rest of it is a Nextjs app wrapped around the WebRTC connection.

Curious because I’m trying to learn Romanian, and since it’s a less common language there are fewer resources available. So I wasn’t sure if you added Dutch with minimal amount of effort following the poster’s request. That said, I gave your app a try with Spanish and it looks pretty good! But I didn’t see a Help page to clarify how I’m “supposed” to interact. Eg I tried saying in English “I don’t understand” (even though I know how to say that in Spanish) and it responded in Spanish which may be hard for absolute beginners. Although full immersion is much better way to learn. I can try playing around more with it to give you some feedback. reply",

While the transcription is technically in the API it's not a native part of the model and runs through Whisper separately, in my testing with it I often end up with a transcription that's a different language than what the user is speaking and the current API has no way to force a language on the internal Whisper call. If the language is correct, a lot of the times the exact text isn't 100% accurate, if that's 100% accurate, it comes in slower than the audio output and not in real time. All in all not what I would consider feature ready to release in my app. What I've been thinking about is switching to a full audio in --> transcribe --> send to LLM --> TTS pipeline, in which case I would be able to show the exact input to the model, but that's way more work than just one single OpenAI API call. reply",

Learning to respond fast in a new language is important, so we're trying to keep a natural pace.

Dutch is not supported yet, and there are still some rough edges. But the idea is simple: help people remember words by using them. You say or type something, and get a reply you can hear or read. In conversations on IF, there is no fixed path. You can start with a topic, then ask to switch to something else. It’s meant to be low-pressure and flexible. Still figuring things out.

The problem with this approach is that for languages like French where the writing differs the pronunciation, the improvement of the student is limited, it does not learn how to properly write the language Particularly for French, the student won a big amount of vocabulary by constantly listening a podcast called \"Small talk in slow French by Nagise\" Your mission: - Make an investigation about what could be an ideal way to learn an present your report \n- Include platforms or material that could be used to support the study process\n- Write a prompt to create a  custom GPT that supports the learning process following the criteria defined on your investigation. The student will use the voice mode, images and text on the GPT as part of its training process and the GPT should be there to assist when needed and to track the progress and areas in need of improvement Take your time and provide first class and high level results, think of you as the most regarded expert on the sector.

If yes, just do it. to many people it is endearing if you are struggling with a language.

If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.

HN might be one, but a lot of us already use AI for repetitive Java code, and those who actually care a lot about boilerplate move on to Kotlin. There's probably some workflow enthusiast communities or Java though. There's the \"practice one kick 10000 times\" type of people, who prefer using something tried and proven like Java than learn a new language. reply",

This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "Typically I get tired of a side project when I stop learning from it. There's a honeymoon period at the start when you're rapidly prototyping things and figuring it out. Then you get to the point where you've explored the problem domain, figured out what works, and have a clear path ahead - the rest of the work being to just implement the vision. This is the part I get bored. Something switches in my brain when I've figured out how to solve a problem, it starts to seek a new problem because it considers that one \"done\", even though most of the work remains. Perhaps it's because that work is more \"painting by numbers\" after the problem is figured out. Does anyone else experience this? reply",

The project is basically a script that scrapes events from various Eventbrite organizers and Meetup groups I am interested in, filters them down by a variety of parameters, and writes them out to ICS files that Proton Calendar can read from. Its been an interesting project because it really reveals how much detritis these sites throw at you in spite of your preferences, and it has helped me basically have something to do with my evenings no matter the day of the week. What I'm tired of is trying to make it flexible so I can open source it. Screw that! As soon as I gave up on flexibility, the number of lines of code dropped significantly. I occasionally update the code when I discover something new that I want to filter by, but otherwise it can now just exist and I can just run it manually every so often. reply",

          "text": "The problem with social media is that it encourages influencers broadcasting to followers over friends mutually interacting and winning over contributing (Great post here about ordinary / competitive conversation: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43080290 ) So fix these problems. 1. No followers. Mutual connections only. Put a strict limit of 1000 connections in place to enforce this. No one actually has a mutual connection with more than 1000 people. This only hurts people trying to gain an audience. Heck, make it so if you haven't read someone else's posts in a year, they stop seeing yours. Do whatever it takes to prevent one-to-many connections. 2. No public content. No one wants the whole world to read their conversations with their friends. The only reason you would want that is if you want to build an audience. 3. No likes. No scores of any kind. If you show people a number, they will try to make it go up. No one tracks a score with their friends. 4. No newsfeed. Don't reward people for never shutting up. Maybe a chronological list of *friends* by most recent update and click into that to see all their updates. 5. No algorithm. Give people tools to find what they want to see; don't try to decide for them. 6. No re-post, no share, no forward, etc. Content lives in one place only, the account of the person who posted it, and it is only visible to who they said it should be visible to. reply",

I agree with most of these, but I'm iffy on this one. \"No one tracks a score with their friends\" is not really true, it makes people feel good to see encouragement and feedback from their friends. There's no reason that encouragement has to be restricted to text comments and messages. Without feedback, you're essentially just screaming into the void knowing someone could be listening. If the things I'm posting could get feedback but don't, that tells me that the things I'm saying aren't really hitting with any of my friends. That's a valuable thing to know, whether or not you choose to act on it. Facebook in the early years was for the most part exactly like what you are suggesting, but with likes, and I at least remember it being a pretty enjoyable place for a few years there (I joined at the very end of 2006). reply",

          "text": "\"Hitting\" with any of your friends is precisely the type of interaction I want to suppress. The way you know if what you say to your friends in real life is interesting to them is if they engage with it. If your feedback mechanism is anything other than the other side of a mutually interesting conversation, you probably aren't having ordinary conversation with friends. What real life feedback mechanisms most closely resembles likes? Applause. Who applauds? An audience. Friends *can* give non-verbal cues in real life that they are interested (nodding, laughing, etc.), but likes are very much not like those non-verbal cues. Non-verbal cues only work in a very small group. There is no non-verbal cue that works to show interest in the context of \"any of your friends\" in real life. Emoji reactions in the context of a back-and-forth chat could work as non-verbal cues, but again, those are very different from drive-by likes with no additional engagement. In this hypothetical social network, if you post something and no one responds to it or engages with it in any way verbally, you would be encouraged to do the same thing you would do in real life if you kept trying to talk about something in a group of friends and no one engaged with it verbally... find something else to talk about (or find a different group for that topic). The goal is very much to mirror the experience of talking to your friends, but facilitated in a way that makes it more asynchronous and scalable (within the limit of your actual real life connections). There are a lot of people in my life I would love to stay better connected with, but maintaining a direct chat can be difficult (what to say) and it doesn't always make sense to put people in group chats because the group might only make sense to me (people I used to work with that I actually like, for example). If I could post about what's going on in my life, what I'm working on, what I'm into right now, etc. and have my real-life friends opt-in to an actual conversation about that... well then it's much easier to stay in touch. I have no interest in knowing how many of my friends \"like\" what I'm sharing. If we aren't mutually talking to each other, we aren't engaging as friends no matter how much they may like it. They're just my audience if they have nothing to say back. Sorry I didn't have time to make this shorter. My goal isn't to convince anyone of anything, just to share a perspective that might be interesting to you, OP or anyone else building something \"social\". You might sum it all up with the question: What if social media tried to be as much like real life friendship and as little like \"influencing\" as possible? reply",

But if I could see the occasional (low frequency) update on things in their life or interesting to them... I could maybe see an opportunity to reach out for a real conversation about something of mutual interest. Imagine you're suddenly teleported to a party with a hundred people you know and like but aren't super close to. How do you join a conversation? I mean, if it was people you were really close to, you'd just go up and talk to someone. That's group chat / SMS. But if it's more aquaintence level... one of two things probably happens: You overhear something that you're interested in and connect on that, or you randomly drop in various conversations at a surface level until something clicks. That's what I'm after. Conversation that naturally flows from a spark. You don't need that with your closest friends, but you don't need a social network to keep up with your closest friends either. I imagine social networking as the tool to provide ongoing sparks for real direct interactive conversations on an occasional but ongoing basis with people you aren't close enough to to just call/text. reply",

My guess is that you'll have some diehard fans early on - Ello did, and they stayed to the end (thanks!) and they'll bemoan every single change - just roll with it, trust yourself but also listen to them. If you get some success you will have a spammer problem (esp porn), but if you limit (better: don't have) public feeds maybe you can avoid the worst of this. Mutual follow makes sense as a way to limit the blast radius of bad actors, but then people will get spammed by friend requests. It SUCKS. Maybe you punish accounts that blast lots of requests but get very few follows back. We did something like this. Actually one idea that I think would work well: once you have a \"this is a spam account\" determination, hide those spam accounts from real users, but let them engage with other spam accounts . This will cost you some compute time, but it will give them the feeling that they are being successful without distracting users. Good luck! reply",

Not that it’s bad per de, but it’s hard to convince people to stay if the service is not entertaining It can also be me not being able to market the project right. Good luck with your attempt!

Really hard to build a business around, I know. But in NYC there are all these recent trends of run clubs, reading groups (events where people bring a book to a cozy location and collectively read with some mood lighting), and similar community-esque events that don't require anyone to interact but offer a forum for those that want it to happen. I was talking last night with a friend about dinner party services, which arrange for themed dinners, and we were saying how we would be interested in that but we wouldn't want to just meet random strangers, there would have to be some sort of draw to a theme or an interest group; otherwise we would just host with our own friends in our own networks. Meetup.com -- that came up in our conversation and neither of us had used it in years. reply",

I fear it devolves into politics and other low quality discussion quickly. The modern Facebook brings out the worst in some of the best people I know.

The lie itself doesn't start out being a lie, but it rapidly becomes the lie in the aggregate of the choices you must make behind the scenes along the way emergent-ly from the centralized nature of any platform which is needed for moderation, and the requirements to operate as a business. Any system with two or more mandates always fails the lesser of the mandates. There can be no trust, Facebook and its analogues have used it all up. You don't develop strong relationships by spending your time in front of a computer. Real friends don't seek friends on social media. As with any communication channel today, you also must capably defend your platform from all manner of nation-state threats that now use 5th Generation Warfare on individuals through social media. Propaganda, Isolation, Torture, Radicalization. If you don't know a thing about these very dark things, there's no shot in the dark where you can actually come up with something that works as a stopgap.

If I was starting a social network I’d look at Chinese mobile games like Azur Lane in how they set up a network of ‘events’ and accomplishments that always give you a reason to play. “Negative” is something else that can be addressed directly.  To make a fact-checking machine you have to make a god, but to detect outrage and negativity you just need ModernBERT, BiLSTM and maybe 20,000 training examples.  It is true that outrage engages people but take that away and you will find there are wholesome things like cat photos that go viral.  How you suppress negativity is up to you, and people will always say that their negativity is their free speech, but detecting negativity in 2005 is mostly a matter of making the training set. reply",

          "text": "I wrote 5k words on the benefits and challenges of a self-hostable product[0] which may be useful to read. At FusionAuth, my employer, we have had both self-hostable and cloud versions for over 6 years. We started out with the self-hosted version and then added a cloud offering. I'd start out with the business case. I'm not sure what \"credential collection\" is, but think about why your customers might want to self-host. Common reasons include: - data sovereignty (legal responsibility towards users from a geography) - data locality (data location) - CONTROL (I put in all caps because that is an overriding reason) - cost (esp if they have existing infrastructure your system can run on) Devtools are a natural fit for self-hosting, as are other tools that target SREs, because the user/buyer is the operator and understands what they are getting into. Is the same true for \"credential collection\"? I dunno. As far as pricing, we charge for features and support in one dimension, then hosting in another. (So if you self-host, the second dimension goes to zero.) That has been confusing to our audience[1]; one commenter said \"your pricing sucks\" :) . We're working to make that simpler, but it's a tough road because it is atypical. Regarding development tasks, have your supported platforms and dependencies be as few as possible (we only require a MySQL or PostgreSQL database and an optional Elasticsearch/Opensearch installation). Margins are way higher on self-hosted if you charge for features, but support will be much tougher. Build in some telemetry (in a transparent way your users can trust) to help your support team. Be prepared to hop on some video calls because sometimes telemetry won't give you enough info. Also be prepared to draw some lines in the sand: is helping someone troubleshoot their proxy configuration in front of your software included? How about their database performance? Product decisions will be harder too, but telemetry can also help there[2]. 0: https://fusionauth.io/blog/building-self-hostable-applicatio... .

A google box running on your local network.  Now there are advanced things like elastic and other search specific technologies that you can use. I think LLMs might follow this market pattern where you can buy something to host yourself and then commoditization happens enough where open source solutions will also evolve to have good enough solutions. An idea for a disrupting company would be to open source their LLM and offer support and feature development to enterprises as the paid offering, kinda like Red Hat or others doing that model. A key difference is running an LLM locally on decent sized compute is fine but it will be costly to scale on your own. reply",

Yes, there's a lot of Open Source, and yes a lot of it is critical, but to see the current state as \"open source \" is not seeing the whole picture. Google us not Open Source. Neither is Gmail, Google Maps etc. Then there's Windows, Office etc. What about AWS. Or iOS. Android is sorta open source, except for all the bits that actually make it useful. And that's before we consider Facebook and friends. Or Netflix. Or Amazon shopping cart. LLMs are following in the footsteps of pretty much every tech company, and every technology - it starts out life being proprietary. Maybe one day not just the software (llama) but the models will also be open source. But no, it doesn't bother me at all. Most all Open Source is built on the ideas of proprietary software. reply",

          "text": "The state of LLMs right now seems analogous to the state of CAD software. There are free options available but they aren't as capable. The good part about this analogy is that the needs of the users aren't very dynamic -- if you are using a CAD software it is for design tasks. The interface may change, but the purpose doesn't. Because of this, the quality gap between free CAD packages and LLMs are natural language models (what words are likely to come next given the context), not any sort of AGI. For that purpose, the gap between open and closed models is closing much faster in LLMs than CAD. I think LLMs will go the way of chess engines -- one of these models will become the Stockfish of LLMs and the proprietary models will end up being a waste of money and resources. reply",

Romanian is much more expressive and precise than English on matters pertaining to housekeeping and farming (peasant activities in general), whereas English is by a mile more suited and expressive in upper-class discourse (negotiations and reasoning of a more abstract or theoretical form; subtle social dynamics). I think to some extent because say Romanian biases heavily towards agriculture in its lexicon, it is an inherent impediment to try to achieve great scientific discoveries in such a language, whereas English or Chinese are evidently better suited. perhaps this raises the question then of wether a globalised language like English would offer greater fairness and freedom of expression, or wether composite languages are for emerge to eg take advantage of German technicality with English managerial interdynamics and French artistry (English already borrows heavily from French and Latin, and is a Germanic language to begin with so is that why it's now the global default language? is it because it's already a semi-composite language?) reply",

The other things you mentioned are pure cultural influenced. Like \"the Chinese is better suited to achieve great scientific discussions\" which is actually achieved by accumulation of knowledge and learning. Another example, the best mathematicians are in France, Russia.., ..., and US by most. Gambia also has \"one\" mathematician.. while English being official. Shouldn't then there be more Gambian mathematicians? ... It's \"culture\" preventing the accumulation of knowledge, or, at least not teaching it amongst the pupils. reply",

Just think of kids not so profound in their language - they think, they reason, but they can't argue about \"to be or not to be...\". But when they grow up, they more and more use and read other topics that utilize higher parts of the language, difficult sentences, etc.. -> so they LEARN and start to think differently on topics. so, my postulation is: the knowledge we gain shapes our thinking. Language itself is the transportation medium for the knowledge. Is the medium is small, so the knowledge described with the medium is also \"small\" or \"not destinctive enough\". We can use a \"second\" language then to make the knowledge more exact and mor destinct/tdefined. But the knowledge can also be gained with other means - learning by doing, as exmaple. So, a language is not necessary to gain knowledge (numb and deaf and blind people also think, but are somehow limited in their expression ...) so based on that, I postulate, it's a coincidence when a language shapes our thinking, but the cause and the \"affecting part\" is the real \"knowledge-transfer\" by the language.

Latin had sic which is very close to the English this , which means to speak in the affirmative requires a relation that qualifies an affirmation. As a result thinking in Latin is absolutely different than thinking in English which has yes/no questions that could not exist in Latin.  When asked a yes/no question without receiving a yes or no answer English speakers immediately assume deception and that assumption is almost always correct.  The exception is when the answering party fully fails to grasp the question, or the question's intent if the question is vague or itself deceptive.  In Latin language answers without a yes or no were the default and even though there is not an option to apply a direct yes or no answer many times deception was none the less assumed regardless due to differing cultural norms, especially in elevated classes. https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/how-do-you-sa... https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/questions reply",

          "text": "may be it's the personal evolvement, that leads to that? One who have or is living abroad for a few years also develops himself in certain ways. Just like with the students who did study abroad. They show, they gain the competence of self-care-taking-in-a-foreign-environment and problem-solving-skills, more than the ones who studied and lived comfortable (often at parent's home). I speak five languages myself. Being born and grown up in one country, went to highschool in second country, studied in a third country. But it's not the languages, but rather what i've learned and the discussions I had, that shaped the today's me. If I didn't study or argue with others, I would less utilize my thinking-as-an-engineer -> clear & aim-oriented, logically structured problem solving. I notice the use of logical thinking in my daily life (if -> then -> but why? -> conclusion) even more after I started programming in spare time. Yes, it's a new language: strict, well defined, clear expression and problem-modeling. The new language did not change my thinking, but rather the way it solved my problems, and the new knowledge of e.g. data structures, did. So, for me, language is a tool for unlocking the knowledge and the knowledge shapes me. another examples that supports my thinking \"its the knowledge that shapes us\":\n- when the war in Ukraine started, a lot of people said \"We have. Give them long-range missles. Give them now.\". But after learning that for some long-range missles it's neccessary to continiously monitor & control the missle with propriatary technology. This technology is secure and difficult to operate and rather shouldn't fall into the hands of enemies - the thinking about \"give them\" changed. But not the language. - Trump's imposed tariffs: Quite a lot of US thinks the tariffs are paid by the producers. After learning, its paid by the importer, they change their thinking too. Language didn't change. But their thinking. so, I'm opposed to the theory that language alone shapes our thinking. It's the knowledge we gain and the links and conclusions we make. Language is static, while knowledge is dynamic. reply",

          "text": "I'm with you on this. The best sign for language shaping us is right in front of our eyes: out kids going to school and peu au peu learning new words, while gaining new insights and knowledge. The higher the language they use, the more grown up they seem. But, in the meantime they also learned concepts and how to use that. So, language is just a vehicle to transport knowledge, while knowledge is possibly cultural tangled, in my thoughts. Once I experienced such thing while teaching students: there was a group of 6 + 1 Ninjagirls (headscarfed, traditional clothing without skin visible). The one of seven was not wearing headscarf, but rather non-body-pronounced, ordinary clothes, but still covering skin. So, being a man myself, the 7 girls always kept distance to me, while I explained the technical subject. So, when it was about hands-on practice, a possibility to examine the partly finished product has been loudly used by 6 of 7:  They warmed up and where happy smiling discussing the topic furiously among each other and me. Except that one girl. She was standing there and thinking and just looking at what we've produced. I noticed that and of course approached her with \"why don't you participate in the discussion. It's important for gathering understanding. Do you have questions?\" She was like: \"I don't understand this. ... How does it exercise an influence on vibration inducement in the finished product?\" I was blown away by the question. Not because it's a difficult question, but rather because in 14y of teaching, no one - no student, no professors, no workers - literally, no one, has thoughts on vibration inducement at this half-finished state. It doesn't make sense to ask it. It's \"too late to\" and \"too early to\" at the same time.. So I, lost my words, said \"Why do you ask this? I mean, I will be very happy to explain it to you, but please, let your conmilitones first finish their discussion.\" .. so, I explained it to her in the way she built up the understanding to answer her own question by herself. I was so blown away by this, that I approached her after and asked her again \"why did you ask it.. I'm very happy about it. In my 14y of doing this...\" and closed it with \"Keep up what ever you've were thinking. Don't let anyone tell you what to do or what to think or learn. I know, you're really special given the situation today..\" And you guess, that gave her a push in her self esteem. Such a big one, that she changed her style to short skirts, open wonderful hair and a lot of makeup and other girly-things over the next few months. She went literally from Zero to Bomb in 3 months. Also did her engagement in studying change. She enjoyed being smart then. Nice story, I like to tell. Thinking changed. No other language involved. But here, it's more of the \"culture thing\" than knowledge, as you said. Culture, by itself, influences the language and words used. In a patriarchal society the word \"emancipation\" is not used often. Agreed. Learning emancipation in a third language doesn't change the thinking towards emancipation. But knowledge of other women living a self-determined life does provoke thinking over the own situation. Culture shapes behavior, behavior shapes language, language expresses accumulated social knowledge and back-fluences culture :) reply",

Consciousness envelops one’s conscious experience, however there is much more (an entire mind technology.) The mechanics of language and their influence on thought is yet another fascinating layer. The apparatus of our minds which shape our thoughts are a technology. You shaping your thoughts is just as distinctive as your voice shaping your words. Many have a wide range of variability. There are many influences. The technology of thought in our minds changes a great deal about who we are and how we interface with the world (more than just words and people.) What is useful is not which language, for every modern language is mature through countless generations “polishing” it. What is useful is how much experience one has, and how they might articulate how this was processed. The technology of the mind may at times seem like an arms race, though it is also like an ouroboros, devouring itself and reinventing through time. reply",

Speaking as someone who has had a handful of languages at a handful of proficiencies under his belt over his life, I don't really think learning any of them have \"expanded my consciousness\" or anything like that by any considerable degree. Sorry to burst your bubble. I learned English, Spanish, and Latin as a teenager, and currently am about 4 years deep into learning Finnish, so I speak with some lived experience on this. If you want to think interesting thoughts, you need to think hard about things for a long time. That's the sine qua non of it. It can be in any language you want, or even in a nonlinguistic substrate like mental visualization. I would heavily caution people away from trying to shortcut this process by first spending 5 years studying e.g. ancient Assyrian and only then attempting to commune with pre-biblical demons (or whatever it is people think they want to do with this - if there's no particular goal in mind, I would say that's yet another red flag). In general, I'm sorry to say, I think language learning is a tremendous waste of time and effort for almost everybody. Exceptions are mainly for hobbyists (even then, there are probably much more worthwhile hobbies you could take up), passing regulatory hurdles (all of mine so far), and integrating into a new culture (Finnish alone so far). If you want a pastime which will really push your brain to think hard and in new ways, philosophy and mathematics are both much better bang for your buck. reply",

To hammer home the generality of this argument I will replace all mentions of an L2 language with a randomly selected one from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_official_languages . * I neither like nor dislike [roll - Tibetan]. I feel about the same way towards [roll - Kalaallisut] as I feel towards all languages, including my native [roll - French]. * I have always had a strong distaste for language learning in general , starting with [roll - Nauruan] when I ~4 years old. But I don't think that distaste is at all uncommon - it's just the obvious ugh reaction anyone would get to something which takes tens of thousands of hours with little to no concrete payoff. * My level is good enough to \"participate in society exclusively in [roll - Khanty]\", but I admit it would take at least a few months of immersion I'm simply not interested in doing. However, this kind of statement is like saying \"don't worry, tennis becomes fun once you make it to the professional leagues\" - it makes the cost-benefit of starting tennis or language learning worse , not better, and much worse if we're talking about a strictly hobbyist approach. Very few other \"good\" hobbies are like this - 10 minutes of exercise a day, for example, has an astonishing ROI right from the start, if you're starting from zero. * Your \"enriching experience\" comment leads us to an interesting question. Consider the group of all people who are C2 CEFR speakers of both, say, [roll - Slavey] and [roll - Sami]. If the experience was so enriching, why are they all not immediately spending another handful of thousands of hours learning a new language? It can't be a monetary cost thing, because language learning is basically free thanks to the Internet. There's no good a priori reason to suspect only the second language is enriching, and the third would be worthless - that would be even weirder. So why don't we see more of them learning e.g. [roll - Zulu]? Because the enrichment isn't worth it . Anything you do consistently for thousands of hours is going to enrich your life, but I would far rather spend those 10,000 hours becoming e.g. a world level Olympic tennis player than a pretty darn good speaker of [roll - Fijian]. reply",
