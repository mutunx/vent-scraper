          "text": "Redis Streams is a \"go-to\" for me, mostly because of operational simplicity and performance. It's also dead simple to write consumers in any language. If I had more stringent durability requirements, I would probably pick Redpanda, but Kafka-esque (!) processing semantics can be daunting sometimes. I didn't have anything but bad experiences with RabbitMQ, maybe I cannot \"cook\" it, but it would always go split-brain, or last issue I had, a part of clients connected to certain clustered nodes just stopped receiving messages. Cluster restart helped, but all logs and all metrics were green and clean. I try to avoid it if I can. ZeroMQ is more like a building block for your applications. If you need something very special, it could be a good fit, but for a typical EDA-ish bus architecture Redis or Kafka/Redpanda are both very good. reply",

          "text": "I would highlight a distinction between Queues and Streams, as I think this is an important factor in making this choice. In the case of a queue, you put an item in the queue, and then something removes it later. There is a single flow of items. They are put in. They are taken out. In the case of a stream, you put an item in the queue, then it can be removed multiple times by any other process that cares to do so. This may be called 'fan out'. This is an important distinction and really effects how one designs software that uses these systems. Queues work just fine for, say, background jobs. A user signs up, and you put a task in the 'send_registration_email' queue.[1] However, what if some _other_ system then cares about user sign ups? Well, you have to add another queue, and the user sign-up code needs to be aware of it. For example, a 'add_user_to_crm' queue. The result here is that choosing a queue early on leads to a tight-coupling of services down the road. The alternative is to choose streams. In this case, instead of saying what _should_ happen, you say what _did_ happen (past tense). Here you replace 'send_registration_email' and 'add_user_to_crm' with a single stream called 'used_registered'. Each service that cares about this fact is then free to subscribe to that steam and get its own copy of the events (it does so via a 'consumer group', or something of a similar name). This results in a more loosely coupled system, where you potentially also have access to an event history should you need it (if you configure your broker to keep the events around). -- This is where Postgresql and SQS tend to fall down. I've yet to hear of an implementation of streams in Postgresql[2]. And SQS is inherently a queue. I therefore normally reach for Redis Steams, but mostly because it is what I am familiar with. Note: This line of thinking leads into Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. Each of which is interesting and certainly has useful things to offer, although I would advise against simply consuming any of them wholesale. [1] Although this is my go-to example, I'm actually unconvinced that email sending should be done via a queue. Email is just a sequence of queues anyway.

Would be interesting to get your take on queues vs streams on the below. I consider myself a little late to the Postgres party after time with other nosql and rbdms, but it seems more and more an ok place to consider beginning from. For Streaming… Supabase has some Kafka stream type  examples that covers change data capture: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-wal-logical-replication Tables can also do some amount of stream like behaviour with visibility and timeout behaviours: pg-boss — durable job queues with visibility timeouts and retries. Zilla — supports Postgres as a source using CDC to act as a stream.\n • ElectricSQL — uses Postgres replication and CRDTs for reactive sync (great for frontend state as a stream Streaming inside Postgres also has some attention from Postgres as Event Store https://eventmodeling.org . This can combine event sourcing with Postgres for stream modeling. pgmq — from Tempo - this is a minimal message queue built on Postgres using append-only design.. Effectively works as a persistent stream with ordered delivery reply",

We wanted replayability and multiple clients on the same topic, so we evaluated Kafka, but we determined it was too operationally complex for our needs. Persistence was also unnecessary as the data stream already had a separate archiving system and existing clients only needed about 24hr max of context. AWS Kinesis ended up being simpler for our needs and I have nothing but good things to say about it for the most part. Streaming client support in Elixir was not as good as Kafka but writing our own adapter wasn’t too hard. reply",

          "text": "Google PubSub is what we use as our message queue, mostly for communicating change data capture via messages to other internal systems. Its typically being consumed by some job system polling on an interval and then doing CRUD to sync changes. Its not very complex and feels like we're running a lot of compute resources to just sync data between systems. Admittedly there isn't good separation of concerns so there is overlap that requires data syncs. I've been looking at things like kafka, etc. thinking there might be some magic there that makes us use less compute or makes data syncs a little easier to deal with but wonder what scale of data throughput is a tipping point where a service like that is really needed. If it turns out its just a different service but same timeliness of data sync and similar compute resources I struggle with what benefits might be provided. I'd love for almost like a levels.fyi style site where people could anonymously report things like this for the tech stacks being used, throughput of data, amount of compute in play, and ratings/comments on their overall solution (\"would do again\", \"don't recommend\", \"overkill\", \"resume filler\").  It feels much like other areas of technology where a use case comes out of a huge company and RDD (resume driven development) takes hold and now there are people out there doing the equivalent of souping up a 1997 honda accord like its a racecar but its only driving grandma to her appointments. reply",

A publisher just pushes rows in, and a subscriber takes an exclusive lock to grab the first row matching the annotations that it cares about (I use DELETE RETURNING, but you can make it work however you need). You can use `PRAGMA data_version` on a dedicated thread to watch for changes and notify other waiters via a condition variable.  It's not the nicest solution, because it's just a loop around a query, but it gets the job done. A req-rep pattern can be done by doing a `INSERT ... RETURNING id` and having the the other side re-push into the same or a different message queue with an annotation referring to that id.  Alternatively, you could have a table with a req, rep, and status column to coordinate it all. It's far from everything you'd need from a complete, robust message broker, but for small single or multi-process message queue with a max of a few dozen readers and writers, it gets the job done nicely.  In a single process, you can even replace the data_version loop thread with `sqlite3_commit_hook` on writers to notify readers that something has changed via the condition_variable. reply",

          "text": "For large applications in a service-oriented architecture, I leverage Kafka 100% of the time. With Confluent Cloud and Amazon MSK, infra is relatively trivial to maintain. There's really no reason to use anything else for this. For smaller projects of \"job queues,\" I tend to use Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ. But just for clarity, Kafka is not really a message queue -- it's a persistent structured log that can be used as a message queue. More specifically, you can replay messages by resetting the offset. In a queue, the idea is once you pop an item off the queue, it's no longer in the queue and therefore is gone once it's consumed, but with Kafka, you're leaving the message where it is and moving an offset instead. This means, for example, that you can have many many clients read from the same topic without issue. SQS and other MQs don't have that persistence -- once you consume the message and ack, the message disappears and you can't \"replay it\" via the queue system. You have to re-submit the message to process it. This means you can really only have one client per topic, because once the message is consumed, it's no longer available to anyone else. There are pros and cons to either mechanism, and there's significant overlap in the usage of the two systems, but they are designed to serve different purposes. The analogy I tend to use is that Kafka is like reading a book. You read a page, you turn the page. But if you get confused, you can flip back and reread a previous page. An MQ like RabbitMQ or Sidekiq is more like the line at the grocery store: once the customer pays, they walk out and they're gone. You can't go back and re-process their cart. Again, pros and cons to both approaches. \"What didn't work out?\" -- I've learned in my career that, in general, I really like replayability, so Kafka is typically my first choice, unless I know that re-creating the messages are trivial, in which case I am more inclined to lean toward RabbitMQ or SQS. I've been bitten several times by MQs where I can't easily recreate the queue, and I lose critical messages. \"Where did you regret adding complexity?\" -- Again, smaller systems that are just \"job queues\" (versus service-to-service async communication) don't need a whole lot of complexity. So I've learned that if it's a small system, go with an MQ first (any of them are fine), and go with Kafka only if you start scaling beyond a single simple system. \"And if you stuck with a DB-based queue -- did it scale?\" -- I've done this in the past. It scales until it doesn't. Given my experience with MQs and Kafka, I feel it's a trivial amount of work to set up an MQ/Kafka, and I don't get anything extra by using a DB-based queue. I personally would avoid these, unless you have a compelling reason to use it (eg, your DB isn't huge, and you can save money). reply",

          "text": "Certainly. There are many paths to victory here. One thing to consider is whether you _want_ your producers to be aware of the clients or not. If you use SQS, then your producer needs to be aware of where it's sending the message. In event-driven architecture, ideally producers don't care who's listening. They just broadcast a message: \"Hey, this thing just happened.\" And anyone who wants to subscribe can subscribe. The analogy is a radio tower -- the radio broadcaster has no idea who's listening, but thousands and thousands of people can tune in and listen. Contrast to making a phone call, where you have to know who it is that you're dialing and you can only talk to one person at a time. There are pros and cons to both, but there's tremendous value in large applications for making the producer responsible for producing, but not having to worry about who is consuming. Particularly in organizations with large teams where coordinating that kind of thing can be a big pain. But you're absolutely right: queues/topics are basically free, and you can have as many as you want! I've certainly done it the SQS way that you describe many times! As I mentioned, there are many paths to victory. Mine works really well for me, and it sounds like yours works really well for you. That's fantastic :) reply",

The latter works, but yeah it eats compute. On the consumer side the duty cycle drives design. If it’s a steady flow then a polling listener is easy to right size. If the flow is episodic (long periods of idle with unpredictable spikes of high load) one option is to put a alarm on the queue that triggers when it goes from empty to non-empty, and handle that alarm by starting the processing machinery. That avoids the cost of constantly polling during dead time. reply",

I came to the realisation that the programming model especially in MSK is rather unintuitive. I found it hard to shift mentally from MSK and its even triggers back to regular consumer spun up in containers etc. but that also it rather MSK than Kafka. I am currently swapping out the whole pub/sub layer to MongoDB change streams, which I have found to be working really well. For queuing it attempts to lock on read so I can scale consumers with retry / backoff etc. Broadcast is simple and without locking, auto delete in Mongo. I will have to see how it really scales and I'm sure I'm trading one problem for another but, it will definitely help to remove a moving part. Overall, app is rather low volume with the occasional spike. I would have stayed with Kafka were there be let's say >100rpm on the core functions. reply",

          "text": "Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. Not across the network. RabbitMQ is neat out of the box. But I went with ZeroMQ at the time. ZeroMQ is cool but during current year I'd only use it to learn from their excellent documentation. Coming from Python, it taught me about Berkeley sockets and the process of building cross-language messaging patterns. After a few projects, it's like realizing I didn't need ZeroMQ to begin with I could make my own! If ZeroMQ's Hintjens were still with us I'd still be using it. It's like the documented incremental process of designing a messaging queue to fit your problem domain, plus a thin wrapper easing some of lower level socket nastiness. At least that's my experience using it over the years. Me talking about it won't do it enough justice. NATS does the lower level socket wrapper part very nicely. It's a but more modern too. Golang's designed to be like a slightly nicer C syntax, so it would make sense that it's high performance and sturdy. So it's similar to ZeroMQ there. I'm not sure if either persist to disk out of the box. So either of these are going to be simpler and faster than Kafka. The DB people are probably trying too hard to cater to the queues. Ideally I'd have normalized the data and modeled the relations such transactions don't lock up the whole table. Then I started questioning why I needed a queue at all when databases (sans SQLite which is fast enough as is) are made for pooling access to a database. Kafka supports pipelining to a relational database but this part is where you kind of have to be experienced to not footgun and I'm not at that level. I think using it as a queue in that you're short-circuiting it from the relational database pipeline is non-standard for Kafka. I suspect that's where a lot of the Kafka hate is from. I could understand if the distributed transactions part is hell but at that point it's like why'd you skip the database then? Trying to get that free lunch I assume. I have an alternative. Try inserting everything into a SQLite file. Running into concurrency issues? Use a second SQLite file. Two computers? send it over the network. More issues? Since it's SQL just switch to a real database that will pool the clients. Or switch to five of them. SQL is sorta cool that way. I assume that would avoid the reimplementing half of the JVM to sync across computers where you get Oracle Java showing up to sell you their database halfway into making your galactic scale software or the whatever. I must be stressed today. Thanks for asking. reply",

Unless the merciful admin lets me roll the 12-sided dice to replace the above cringe with the below piece I carved out of soap. --- I always check for maintained libraries for my programming languages for any messaging library. Bindings in many languages are consistent across Kafka, ZeroMQ, and NATS. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue per se. It handles transactions to the disk. The networking is a simple broadcast, not a shared queue. You also can't (canonically, at least) pop/insert/delete rows. It's append-only. It can do basic seeking, like replaying from the start. ZeroMQ is a good choice for learning from its excellent documentation, and programmers interested in C programming. Probably a good lead into Beej's networking guide. ZeroMQ is the odd one as it has no central broker (\"Zero\" for zero broker); you copy your favorite broker.py pattern from the ZeroMQ guide.

          "text": "Sir, your reply is more coherent than mine. I'll give you props for that. Still, I disagree that Kafka is always overkill. When god opened a datagram socket on your computer, you needed to have been capturing this data X months ago, but weren't paying attention. You need to build warbot.py and put it into production before you have the chance to deal with cold storage. Kafka is my go-to if you can do this before you run out of disk space. I frequently append JSON lines to a \"data.json\" file in Python. Add a socket server, compression, and typed bindings for 20+ languages. Boom. Kafka. Don't oversell it. Need to delete a row? Congratulations, you selected the wrong tool. It's appending JSON lines to a file. Kafka is a write-ahead log, not a queue. To your point about Postgres, I've found Postgres has fantastic JSONB support and awesome developers who have been very influential in my life and whom I admire. Postgres is my preferred cold storage, which I connect to Kafka. It feels like swimming upstream because RMDBs are traditionally for normalized data, not denormalized JSON lines that make XML look hip again. If you have a choice in DB, Postgres' JSONB has helped me avoid unnecessary normalization steps. It's good to have options. ZeroMQ would call this the Titanic pattern and mic drop because the guide has a section on it. That's why I like ZeroMQ. Edit: Apologies for typos/brevity. I have an ancient phone that only works with 20% of the web and phone apps. There are no apps or LLMs to help this dyslexic soul. Reference for the Titanic pattern.

          "text": "It's important to distinguish between the use cases. Queues, streams, logs, databases, etc. are different kinds of tools you can use, and what the right tool is depends on your semantics. For example: Message queues are good for work that must be done in strict order where you want to deal with one message at a time. They aren't such a great fit for large batch movement of data, like logs or high volume events, because having a per-message acknowledgement state requires a lot of round trips over the network that simply isn't needed; you want to treat the entire bulk of the flow to carve out big chunks of it, because CPUs wnd networks and disks are more efficient when doing the same operation over large amounts of data in one go. If you are executing \"tasks\" (like image processing, ML inference, webhooks), ordering by insertion order might not be the right choice, either. Sometimes you want to coalesce (dedupe by key). Sometimes you want to ensure the processing for a key (e.g. a customer ID) is done in the same process and not randomly distributed over all your workers. Sometimes you want delivery to be strictly sequential, requiring an exclusive worker rather than massively parallel fan-out. And so on. Where I work, we use a mix of things depending on the application. I am a big fan of NATS. It's not itself a message queue, but its primitives can be combined to handle all sorts of behaviors. Core NATS is more like ephemeral pub/sub, while Jetstream gives you durable, highly available Kafka-like streams. I like combining queues with database state. Use the queue as an efficient way to order items (like jobs or events) for massively scalable distribution, and use the database to store the current state of things. For example, imagine you're delivering webhook messages. We first store the message in the database with the state \"pending\", then write an event to the queue about it. The worker receives the event, double-checks its state is still \"pending\", then executes it. If delivered, mark as \"done\" and ack the message. Otherwise, mark as \"failed\" and create a new queue message to retry. This way, you have durable state in a solid database, and the queue is an efficient way to coordinate the workers. (There's a bit more work here to ensure consistency, but this is the gist of it.) Core NATS is fantastic as a communication primitive between ephemeral processes. You can use it for RPC, for lightweight broadcasts (e.g. reload config everywhere), even for things like leases or caching or similar. Jetstream is like Kafka but more flexible; for example, each message has a wildcard subject that can be filtered on, so different consumers can very efficiently filter a big, commingled stream by interest. In Jetstream streams, messages have per-consumer ack/nack state in addition to a position, so you're not limited to Kafka's linear \"position\". Overall, a superb data model, and very easy to manage as infra. One weak point with NATS is a maximum message size of 10MB. This means that you sometimes have to invent your own chunking if your application needs to send larger payloads. Doing this opens up some cans of worms, so I honestly wouldn't recommend it. For large batch stuff, Redpanda is a better option. reply",

          "text": "I think you are asking the right question here. Before building something determine if there is a market, and if that market will pay. Personally my gut says no. I personally don't use any tools in that range, but I also think that at first glance the numbers don't add up. Firstly, people pay for value. You seem to feel your ideas are low value (hence the low price) which means you don't really expect users to use it a lot. And \"very occasional use\" doesn't motivate me to go to the effort of paying. Since the absolute number is low, you're either expecting really tiny numbers or you're hoping for really high numbers. The tiny numbers result in tiny revenues and tiny profits, so what's the point? High numbers of people are likely to consume all that revenue. If you got high numbers you'd like ho the ads based route, with maybe a premium \"no ads\" subscription. But then you can charge more (getting rid of ads is $20 value.) But again people dont pay for occasional use. If the use is frequent then it's likely more valuable than 5$. To answer your root question - people don't \"subscribe\" to single-use tools (if by single-use you mean one-time-use.) Perhaps you need to charge more? (People pay $10 for a coffee and that's single use). Or charge per use? reply",

I'm honestly happy with very low profit if it's possible. I love building stuff as a hobby and I'd just like to make enough money to cover my hosting costs so I can run side projects that cost me a bit to deploy. Maybe a better model is 1-2 free uses and then sign up and then charge per use at-cost? That way I can cover costs without getting people stuck into a subscription... reply",

If you like walking try and walk around the centre as much as possible (without using phone mapping ideally), you'll realise it's quite small really and get to know the place. Take some time to experience the history, art galleries, theatre etc I wish I'd done more of that now I live in the provinces. Take time to see different parts of the UK, although I loved living in London for 2 years and visit a lot I way prefer other parts of the UK and now a lot of people live remotely it's practical to live in the midlands for example and go there for work once a week maybe. Take regular trips to Europe by plane, train or car. It's cheap and doable for a weekend. There is a lot of variety between countries/cities which I think you'd really appreciate. reply",

I've been here for ~10 years and feel like I'm familiar with a fairly narrow slice of it (mostly north/north east a little bit).

          "text": "Thanks for your feedback and for validating the pricing model! We see it the same way. Most property management systems charge campground owners several thousand dollars upfront, before they can even try the software. That’s where our approach stands out: we offer a low barrier to entry paired with a modern user experience. Many competitors started over 15 years ago, and you can tell by how outdated their products feel. Taking just a 1% cut can pay off if it helps capture more market share, this was my thinking too. We’re not quite there yet, as not all of the 250 campgrounds on our platform have adopted online payments. Still, it’s both exciting and a bit terrifying to see some of them already processing over $250,000 in annual bookings through our system. I’ve had a few sleepless nights, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend building a marketplace product to everyone. Once real money flows through your platform at that scale, things get intense fast. reply",

I was probably most influenced by Alle Farben, who was known for his mixtapes before he started producing his own tracks (which I wasn’t really a fan of). But I also showcased a darker side in some of my mixtapes (like \"Der schwerste Gang einer Ente\" where I used artists like Burial). I saw myself more as a consumer than a producer. I mainly created mixtapes because I was constantly discovering and consuming new music. When I had the chance to play at a club or an open-air event (I tried it once), I quickly realized I wasn’t too comfortable performing in front of an audience :) Around that time, I had just started learning to code and built my first little automations to help me discover even more music on SoundCloud. So I noticed this was another (more lucrative with the similar level of passion) career path where I didn't had to be in front of an audience. reply",

Back then, it was arguably the best platform for getting discovered as a producer or DJ. When I stopped making music, I was getting a lot of requests to play at clubs across Germany and Europe. At the time, I preferred to stay anonymous, so I never made the leap into the professional or public scene. Still, I was in touch with some producers early in their careers on SoundCloud when they had 1000 followers, like Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn, if those names ring a bell. So yes, I’d say it was (is?) definitely a launchpad for artists. But as far as I know, there was never a real way to monetize on the platform. Unfortunately, when I stopped paying for the Pro version, they removed almost all of my music. Only 5 mixes are still up :') reply",

We sent them to various regions across Germany, but my guess is they ended up in a pile at the campground reception and never reached the actual owners. That said, we manually scraped around 500 campgrounds near us, designed postcards that highlighted CloudCamping’s key selling points, and sent them out using a different mailing service. Since we didn’t hear back from anyone specifically mentioning the postcards, I assume they didn’t convince anyone in the end. Still, it was a fun experiment, and who knows, it might work better in a different context! reply",

These days, if I were mailing postcards, I'd make sure to add a special QR code to them.

Without fail the creators happen to haha stumble in and happily take your feedback.

Very time-consuming and annoying, but it gets the job done. Just make sure the content drives users back to the site and is actually relevant, interesting, and valuable Next 100K users: programmatic long-tail SEO. obviously this is unique to my own product, but I realized that people were organically already searching for the data contained within the maps I host. By focusing on organizing that data and making it understandable to Google, I started a traffic flywheel that's paid off massively. I'm now exploring programmatic social media marketing as the next lever for the next 1M users as it directly drives even further benefits on the SEO side One last thought - whatever growth channel you pick should really align with the product you are building. Some products are a great fit for SEO, others not. Some are awesome for Tiktok/Reels, others not. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Good luck! reply",

Getting to this point has involved posting to as many channels as possible (without wearing out my welcome in any of them) My first 40 subscribers came from direct friends and my LinkedIn network. I got about 150 subscribers from a single popular post on Hacker News, posted here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43461618 The remainder have come from regular posting on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack notes, and starting to get search traffic from Google. I've gotten no traction from Reddit (wow, the programming subreddits are so much angrier than every other subreddit where I contribute!) Twitter (seems like it's pay to play, which I won't do) or IndieHackers (I post milestones just for fun, but it hasn't amounted to anything). I've found that I need to post twice a week to grow. I had a period where I was sick and was putting less effort into posts, and another period where I was dealing with a mortgage and had to post only once a week, and my subscriber growth treaded water instead of gradually growing. Even casual visitors to the site can tell the difference between moderate and minor effort. [0] https://www.clientserver.dev/ reply",

          "text": "I have my own domain (that I share with relatives), and use mailbox.org for hosting it. I chose them after a rather lengthy search. Reasons for choosing them(pros) - multiple \"payment accounts\" can share the same domain (securely), which was my primary reason for choosing them. I.e. I cannot access my brother's mail in any way, even if we share the same domain, because he is his own admin. - you can pay extra for more space (i.e. additional storage on a per gigabyte basis) - extra \"domains\" and \"aliases\" for the mailboxes are possible and free (for a given number dependent on your subscription level) - German company (i.e. EU company, which I care a lot about). - They seem like an old-fashioned unix company that respect privacy, so my risk of being data harvested or used for ai training seems miniscule - They seem to be financially stable and (if I remember correctly) around 40 employees which is a reasonable size - They have a full online office suit (which I do not use) Reasons not to (cons) - you pay per mailbox, not per domain - their business plans starts to expensive for my taste (so my business domain is at another hoster) as the business is basically revenueless currently. Shouldn't be a problem, if the business is \"real\". I want to stress, that I am only a customer, no partner or affiliate or receive any benefit of writing this. reply",

Their iPhone app also crashed all the time for me and you can’t use regular mail clients. For PCs you can use the bridge with a client but I found nothing like that for the phone. WRT proton I think it was overkill for my use case. If I need complete secrecy I can use GPG over email. I find Fastmail to be cheaper, faster, and more compatible for every day use. I also really like the email alias feature which I use all the time. Fastmail and a standalone VPN was significantly cheaper than protons offerings as well. At the end of the day as long as you use a custom domain it doesn’t really matter where you go. Even Gmail works fine here. To me it just matters where you will compromise on usability for secrecy. reply",

And when the domain expires there is usually [1] a period afterwards when it can be retrieved before anyone else can buy it. Set the domain to auto-renew, make sure the registrar has your payment details, set calendar reminders. Its not difficult. The alternative is gmail or similar, where you can lose access to your email, and perhaps the root of your digital \"identity\", at the whim of some hair-trigger algorithm [2] and be left unable to even communicate with the provider to get it fixed. So get a domain from a decent registrar. Pay several years in advance. Keep your payment and contact details up to date.

          "text": "> It seems there is no standard proper way to store private keys. The gold standard for this would be a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is essentially a device that stores private keys with certain guarantees of physical security (e.g, that private key material cannot be extracted from the device once it has been generated or placed there, and the device performs operations using the key material on behalf of some client). HSMs in various forms underpin all sorts of cryptosystems that society depends on, because securing private key material at rest is essential. You'll find them everywhere from your debit/credit card, to certificate authorities, financial institutions, defense, and your smartphone. For your use case, I'd recommend taking a look at Yubikeys. I did a writeup a while back on how to use them to store different types of private keys for various purposes: https://blog.ctis.me/2022/12/yubikey-piv-gpg/ reply",

I've kept everything that didn't die in sudden catastrophic failures.\nI can access files that I got before there was even a harddrive in my computer.\nAnd I love it, like browsing an old photo album, I once in a while take a stroll through my life, but, unlike the photo, which only captures one angle of a situation, I have entire installations to look at, what was on my desktop 20 years ago, what had I downloaded, oh, that movie, yeah, I remember it now! those funny pictures a long-forgotten friend send to me over IRC DCC, the chatlogs of our cringe teenage banter.. Yes, this is hoarding, but, as opposed to the physical kind, where it goes from some neatly displayed trinkets, to inaccessible rooms and biological hazards, computer files allow us almost infinite room, and almost infinite structure. While it is probably not healthy to entertain the idea, I believe most hoarders, given sufficient physical space (infinite, really, is sufficient cannot be determined before they're dead and no longer amassing objects), their collections, their order, would look somewhat neater (although not any less pathological). Whereas physical objects are a burden both in weight and volume, a few hundred terabytes of data does not take up significantly more room in the physical realm.. A file server, and its backup, is really all it takes.. So I don't think they're comparible.. At least, it depends, also, how it affects you, is it a source of stress and negativity, or simply a peace of mind, or a mad obsession.. I don't delete stuff, but I don't fuss over it either, it's not a big deal, once in a while, I move everything out of sight, it's a very small effort, and, so far, 30 years later, current me is grateful for past me for leaving those little breadcrumbs to spark my memories, and so, I will continue this tradition, in honor of future me. reply",

          "text": "Not a single source of truth. The often cited study is [3] which shows longform writing to be more beneficial - it also comes to this conclusion: \"Although more notes are beneficial, at least to a point, if the notes are taken indiscriminately or by mindlessly transcribing content, as is more likely the case on a lap-top than when notes are taken longhand, the benefit dis-appears.\" There was a follow-up study made (see [1], [2]) that showed it made no difference in the end. It's what you do with it afterwards that really matters. Long story short? One form is not more superior to other, but I find typed text (in a digital document) easier to manipulate, transfer to other tools (i.e. Anki) and less friction when I'm thinking as I type. --- [1] https://www.themantic-education.com/ibpsych/2023/01/20/note-...

Ctrl-F will generally find what I need.  Aside from that, what's mostly been helpful is the dates - I often remember roughly when I learned a bit of information, so if I can't find it with Ctrl-F, I'll scroll back to that \"era\" and look around.

Eg: See what Perkeep tried to do. Here's an idea: We should be able to record the full experience stream (or just the laptop screen, let's say) for a person -- digitize it suitably (eg. pull out all the text, or tokenize it with a VLM, etc), attach some metadata, and have the whole database ready for a person to query / play with, using powerful LLMs. To the extent that you can store everything and perform effective recall/search, it obviates the need to carefully \"pre-process\" bits by noting them down in the right file, tagging them appropriately, adding metadata, etc. All of which should make for a much nicer UX. Given the Jevons' paradox though -- I wouldn't be surprised if our experience stream becomes so dense/rich that storing everything and querying from it eventually becomes prohibitively expensive. We would then have to construct pre-processing rules to prune the stream, and amortize the cost of certain deductions by performing them at data ingestion time instead of repeating it for each query. It's all just the basic principles of system design at the end of the day, and how systems need to be rearranged as various component capabilities (and user needs) scale. reply",

          "text": "I tried several \"information management\" and \"knowlege management\" programs over the years, but none of them worked the way I wanted. My original method was a directory full of plain text files arranged by subject, that I brought up with my text editor. Over the years I wrote a specification for a system tailored for my needs, that could manage different forms of media, notes, saved web pages, ebooks, and so forth.  The spec grew until I set the project aside as more trouble than it was worth.  In retrospect I wish I had kept going. At the moment I'm using plain old hand-written subset of HTML linked to subdirectories arranged by subject.  As time permits I will finish the (simplistic) custom browser, which will also let me annotate pages and edit files. I have looked into some of the indexing programs that look inside files and index their contents in a searchable fashion.  They all take a vast amount of storage space, probably because over the decades I have amassed a vast amount of data.  After experimentation I decided to pass on the indexers as well.  I have always managed things in a rigid hierachical arrangement, and it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for.  On the other hand, I know what's there and where I put it, which makes it easy for me.  It would be much less useful for someone else. Never underestimate the usefulness of a plain text file.  It can be written, read, searched, and indexed by almost anything, should you wish to do so.  Some of mine date back to the mid-1980s and MS-DOS 2.1, to OS/2 and Windows (briefly), Linux, and even Haiku.  Every platform has subdirectories and some kind of editor; that's real portability. And if you ever have to deal with ancient machines that don't speak ASCII, much less UTF, there's probably some kind of conversion utility to let you move your files to IBM EBCDIC or DEC Sixbit. If you're running emacs, the \"org mode\" add-in uses lightly-formatted text files organize data, which is then available within the editor.  It's worth looking at if you're an emacs user, assuming you're not using org mode already. reply",

          "text": "TIP: When asking for advice in relation to knowledge management, note-taking, etc., be sure to ask for precise details regarding commenters' solutions. There are many people who participate in these discussions who don't seem to take a lot of notes (e.g., one file or paper notepad for all of their notes!). I have a personal knowledge base that currently includes almost 7,000 files in which I store my notes. I take notes on everything. Every technology. Every project. Every meeting. Every product I evaluate. EVERYTHING. My notes are stored in Org files that I edit with Emacs and Org mode[1]. Org files are written using a feature-rich lightweight markup language[2] that is much more powerful than Markdown (which is used by other note-taking tools like Obsidian). For example, Org supports plain text spreadsheets[3], a feature I love. People tend to disqualify Org and say, \"I don't use Emacs,\" while assuming that Emacs users choose Org because we already use Emacs. But I started using Emacs specifically for Org, not programming. Regardless of which tool you end up using, consider organizing your note files using hierarchical tagging. I started using hierarchical tagging for my notes right after Wikipedia launched and I saw how effectively hierarchical tagging was being used there. Each Wikipedia article can belong to multiple categories, and each category can belong to multiple categories. This is hierarchical tagging, and it's worked great for my notes. At the bottom of every one of my Org files, there is a list named \"Parent topics\", and each parent file has its own \"Parent topics\" list (excluding the \"main topics\" files, which have no parents).

It will then send me emails about the things that I have saved recently and how they are all connected. You are welcome to try it and share anything feedback that you may have. At the moment, I can save markdown notes, websites, files, anything, and it shows everything in a nice grid view while also generating AI summaries, like TLDR and keywords (which I can then search for.) I will try to add those features / fix those bugs that you suggest. :) https://sunchay.com reply",

          "text": "I'm not a lawyer but have talked to a few founders who faced similar situations, ie. employee breaks the law or there's a substantial breach of ethics. 1) Document your case and speak to your lawyer. Pray they didn't do anything that would affect your customers/clients that could cause legal issues for you. I assume you're reviewing all their communications. 2) In most cases for early-stage companies, it's probably not worth it financially to pursue the case. It'll end up eating a lot of time, energy, and money that could've gone elsewhere. In the very least, documenting your case and throwing out some low-cost tactics could be useful for defensive purposes. 3) The priority at this point, I assume, is to re-establish your sales op. I would reach out to your professional networks and let them know not to work with this individual. Recruit your investors' networks as well, if any. The goal is to find good ways to protect yourself and your friends/partners. 4) Use the crisis to rally the team! You've been debuffed all this time! Turn this into a gift. 5) This sort of stuff happens all the time in one form or another. And it'll happen again. Anecdotally, I've found that it's happening more now with remote work where it's just harder to vet people. And if you're working cross-cultures, it can be even more difficult.

          "text": "I think the decline of FILE_ID.DIZ files is largely a byproduct of changing distribution methods. Back in the BBS and early FTP days, these small text files were crucial because they provided a quick summary for file archives, especially when bandwidth was limited, and you couldn't afford to waste time downloading the wrong file. With the rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, project descriptions and metadata have become more integrated. The README.md has essentially replaced FILE_ID.DIZ as the default \"project descriptor\", but with much more flexibility for formatting, linking, and even embedding media. Additionally, the way we discover and share software has changed. We now have package managers, app stores, and automatic metadata parsing tools that handle much of what these files used to do. Plus, we expect modern software to have much more comprehensive documentation than a few lines in a .DIZ file. reply",

          "text": "From a funding perspective I suppose it's pretty simple - like with all businesses the owners pony up the cash. The regular model is that you need cash, so you go looking for it, selling (part) ownership. In this case you have pre-determined the owners, and presumably their share %, so presumably they're putting up the cash. Alternatively you can go with a non-ownership approach. Ie a loan. That'll vote either an interest rate, and usually dome collateral (which I guess also comes from the owners.) If you go this route I recommend you get a lawyer to clearly explain the implications of liability - one participant can easily be on the hook for the whole loan, not just their share of it. They'd be much better off taking small individual loans to \"buy their share \" than participating in a group loan. Future admin work may also be affected by your governance model. There will be times when all owners need to sign, and you need to thus have mechanisms to strip ownership if the person leaves, or dies. Shareholdings which become part of their estate, and are inherited are a concern. In short, you need a lawyer well versed in these structures. Not just internet advice. I applaud your vision, but you need to think very carefully through all aspects of this. reply",

          "text": "You’d bootstrap, and then have future employees buy into a restricted share class (you could also take on debt to fund and personally guarantee until you can pay it back with future revenue, or find someone wealthy to write an investment check [1]). You're aligning incentives and sharing in the economic success, but using share restrictions to prevent, broadly speaking, shenanigans that are not aligned with your desired outcome. You wouldn't want shares transferred without board approval, for example. Craigslist was a cautionary tale about this [2], make sure your agreements are drafted to withstand potential adversaries. The culture should be clearly communicated about this when hiring and onboarding. Check out Certified EO [3] [4], they can help you.

          "text": "Lot of work happened in the last 5-10 years in the web3 space around tech-enabled participatory governance, with some funding backdrop because it's on top of a crypto platform. ENS is kind of the poster child https://docs.ens.domains/learn/protocol/ In terms of participation incentive models I like pointing people to slicing pie. The concept is simple enough and can learned from their free materials. Helpful mental model quantifying sweat \"equity\" where equity can be voting shares, or actual financial shares: https://slicingpie.com/ In terms of governance policy that is specific to your domain- what are the incentives and measures and countermeasures to ensure good behavior from the different roles of participants particular to therapy- there are certainly codes of conduct in the therapy space but probably this is going to be new work for you. I have read quite a bit in the anarchy space, including Graeber, and Chomsky's references and pull-outs from the moments during the Spanish Civil War when there was real movement here- regret to say that the prior thinking does not strike me as anywhere near sufficient to serve as models for the current shape of the world. A lot of new work has to get laid down for these to be real things. Democracy is a fragile mechanism that as we see can collapse quickly under lots of limited resource regimes and when community trust is fractured. High trust does not scale. Low trust is needed to scale and professionalize. But +1, think now is a good time for worker-controlled services to serve as a growing alternative to platform controlled services (just saw first Amazon therapy ad today, like, are you effing kidding me?)

          "text": "+1 to all that. My business is a kind of consulting collective, high trust, people who have known each other for decades. High bar for participation. Careful to ensure everyone stays on the right side of the IRS \"self-employed\" line, while trying to be coordinated and efficient about common expenses and benefits. Cooperative but not a democracy or cooperative per se- having participated in coops including the famous Park Slope Food Coop- think the low-trust semi-informed cooperative democracy is really, really hard to make work when the context ultimately is business and making a living. We have looked very closely at the web3 and especially programmatic stablecoin machinery, there are so many ways having little structures like that would help with risk and cash flow- like, being able to easily self-set up escrow structures with clients who may themselves have cash flow risk. Could definitely do it outside the US, adoption inside probably never get over the hump. Therapy is not so much project based but some common insurance and billing tooling, and then tax reporting, would be beneficial. Anyway, hope you are able to get traction. reply",
