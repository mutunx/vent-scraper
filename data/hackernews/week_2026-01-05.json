I enjoy building dynamic, high-performance applications—ranging from responsive UIs with React to real-time backend systems that scale. Most recently, I created Willow, an open-source framework for building Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines. It leverages Kafka, Debezium, and PostgreSQL to process database changes in real time. You can check it out here: https://willow-cdc.github.io/ . What I bring to the table: - React & Frontend Expertise: Built component-driven UIs with React, TypeScript, and Material UI\n- Backend & Data Processing: Designed scalable APIs, database workflows, and event-driven systems\n- Distributed Systems & Real-Time Data: Worked with Kafka, WebSockets, Redis, and CDC pipelines\n- DevOps Awareness: Experience with Docker, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and performance tuning I'm looking for remote opportunities where I can work on scalable web apps, high-performance APIs, and data-driven workflows.

I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me.

Résumé/CV: Available by request Email: rtlo9962@gmail.com I'm a software engineer with a background in law and business (JD/MBA), now focused on hands-on engineering for cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, and AI-powered applications. I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. Working on a Datadog Observability exporter currently. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

I make teams easier, often creating fixes for customer/developer pain points (really good at this). Although I've not had the title of \"Lead\" to date, I've filled that role as advisor to peers, user story generator, and representative for requirement meetings with stakeholders. I'm ready to lead a gangbuster team!

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers.

          "text": "Location: Remote, Canada Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS Interests : systems programming, compilers, 2D & 3D graphics, performance -------- Hello, my name is Jesse. I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before. I've worked at every level of the stack, from cycle-shaving hot loops that saturate instruction pipelines to the frontend of large web applications. My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler, a cycle simulator and visual debugger. In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack. I'm comfortable working in heavily multithreaded/async soft-realtime environments where performance is a key acceptance criteria. I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines. I have working knowledge of interpreters, dynamic language runtimes and garbage collectors. I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to. In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly. I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external. I have a track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better. In my personal life, I enjoy travelling, surfing, climbing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, pirates, and attending raves. I like the phrase \"have strong opinions, weakly held\". If I was born to do one thing in this world, it's program computers.

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

I have 15 years of web experience building CMS and CRM for small and large companies. As a co-founder (as well as my prior years), I wore many hats and spent countless hours as a result I can architect and design large codebases, hire and retain talent, lead and manage teams and set company-wide goals. I built and managed an engineering team located all around the globe and built a platform empowering small and medium businesses to run their operations; the company is entering a new phase of growth and it is the right time for me to find opportunities that aligns with my personal goals. I am looking for a role at an established company. The bigger the problem, the more exciting. A perfect role for my profile may be one that blends my experience of building a successful B2B2C startup (building teams, product and software) and my experience of building B2B tools at a large company (Twitter). If you need someone that can be an immediate value-add, bringing a ton of firepower, solving big problems and rallying teams to move mountains: hit me up! reply",

I have worked as a full-stack engineer for the past five years where I have built consumer-facing features, lead teams, and helped shape the tech culture of a small startup. Apart from my experience in full-stack web development, I am also interested in AI and databases. I have made some recent contributions to LangChain and LangGraph. I would be more than happy to work anywhere in the stack and in any domain. Looking for roles with high ownership, strong engineering culture, and meaningful technical depth. reply",

We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team.

          "text": "Technically, no—and that’s actually a huge plus. The 'Beckham Law' (24% flat rate) applies to the rest of Spain. Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

          "text": "Oh no, haven't gotten reports about the website being slow, thanks for flagging! Which browser are you using? Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

You will craft performant, stable frontends that explain technical concepts to non-technical users and help us iterate fast based on customer feedback. AI Engineer: Applied AI plus strong software engineering. You will build, evaluate, and deploy LLM-driven features like deep document analysis and interactive chat, working with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. Expect hands-on Python, ML system design, experimentation, and production reliability. Bonus for RAG depth and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Hugging Face. Backend Engineer: (looking for Kotlin/Java/Scala experience). You'll work across the backend: building enterprise integrations, large-scale scraping and parsing pipelines, and systems that let users apply LLMs to millions of documents to generate insights at scale. We're looking to build our in-person team in NYC but also open to remote! Apply: https://starbridge.ai/careers and mention HackerNews or email recruiting@starbridge.ai with your resume. reply",

The information to diagnose most issues exists, but finding it takes longer than fixing the problem. AI generated code is making this worse. Cleric is an AI SRE that autonomously investigates production issues and surfaces findings to engineers. It connects to your existing tools, reasons through the evidence, and tells you what's wrong. We believe engineers should ultimately be accountable in production, and our goal is to help them go much faster. The hard part is making agents reliable when there's no single right answer. We've built evals, memory systems, and feedback loops that improve with every incident. Gartner just named us a Cool Vendor, we are well funded with years of runway, and most importantly the engineers that use our product find it very sticky. We're hiring the following roles: - Staff SWE, AI: Build the reasoning engine. Design evals, debug agent behavior (not just code), expand what it can handle. You've built agents and operated distributed systems at scale. - Staff SWE, Product: Define what AI SRE should be. Spend time with engineers during incidents, find gaps, decide what to build. You've owned products and know production pain. - Head of Marketing: Engineers love the product but we need to reach more of them. Software engineers are allergic to AI hype, and you'll need to cut through it. Technical background required.

Almost all work we do has some meaning no matter how boring or useless it may seem. For example, lets take whatsapp. We can talk about how it erodes user privacy and has access to so much data and is more dangerous especially after being owned by FB. However, why do you think it became so big ? It helped connect you with anyone across the world in a second with incredible speed and accuracy. Before whatsapp, there was nothing remotely close (I know because I have family across the world and before whatsapp, it was always a battle to connect with them over a quick call). So is whatsapp an evil company/product or did it make the world a better place ? You can say both depending on how you look at it. This argument can be made for almost all work in my opinion. reply",

          "text": "Work may enable altruism outside of your actual job. For example, I got fulfillment from sharing my journey publishing some open source software over the course of a few months. Having savings helped make that possible. SMART criteria[1] can help to get out of a rut. \"Making the world a better place\" is very difficult to satisfy. How many people? What is better? How much better?\nI don't advocate for quantising abstract ideas in general but sometimes the thought process of coming up with a number and hitting it helps to get going. My current dayjob involves me wrangling a clunky Java system written like FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition[2]. Keeping this abomination running and getting paid for it feels soulless. Yet I genuinely believe I'm able to stick to my values. For example, there are 3 components tightly coupled to proprietary AWS systems (AWS Lambda and Simple Queue Service). I feel this has made the world a (very slightly!) worse place; Amazon to me represents the bad side of humanity (greed, scrupulousness).\nFurthermore, people new to the software dev industry may never know that it's possible to implement these kinds of systems using significantly simpler, portable designs without making a deal with the devil!\nMy goal is to refactor the system to instead use the language's built-in concurrency primitives to perform the same work. The next person who sees the refactored work can more easily take it and run with it without needing to know anything about AWS. That  person doesn't need to care either; I can always share this story with others who I don't work with. Maybe AWS does something so egregious that it's distasteful even to company executives; I can confidently say that we're not as tied to AWS as we think. I'm not changing the entire world for all eternity. But in a way I am changing my little tiny insignificant slice of this world today in ways that I hope to inspire even just 1 other person in their own tiny insignificant slice :) [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria [2]: https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris... reply",

          "text": "How will my work make you feel better? I think what you're really asking is how can your work make the world a better place? And you're looking for ideas? How many people do you need to \"improve\" to make you feel self-worth? 1? 10? A billion? What do your customers think? Do they think their world is improved by spending their money with you? Do you think they're spending money with you because it makes them worse off? In truth 99% of people make the world better, even at a small scale, even if they don't know it. That person directing traffic, flipping buyers, working on a production line, is contributing to society. Even traditionally despised occupations (tax collector, adware programmer) perform vital functions that society needs to function well. In our journey through life its common to reach a point where one seeks to find \"significance\". Naturally the first place you look for this is work. If you are functionally easily replaced (think payroll clerk) then it's easy to become despondent. But easy replacement doesn't make you less significant to the people who rely on you every month. Equally you dismiss \"paying the bills\". As if your loved ones are not sufficient for \"making the world better\". Or as if the people receiving those bills are not sufficient. That waiter you tip, that grocery you buy, the mechanic who fixes your car - you lean on them for your life, and they benefit from your custom. I'll close by suggesting that significance seldom comes from work. It comes from how you treat people. \"Seeing\" people, saying hello, treating them with humanity, that's how you make the world better. Thank people sincerely for the way they improve your life. Acknowledge the hidden people who make your life easy. (Go thank your payroll clerk.) Tell others how they are significant in your life, regardless of how menial their task for you is. When you find the significance in others, you'll also find it in yourself. I wish you well. reply",

          "text": "I want to reiterate the points other have brought up. Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

I've noticed that the best way to keep relevant as an engineer is to ignore flavor of the day frameworks and tech but rather focus on the basics. For example, if you're working in financial modeling, one way to improve as an engineer to get better at the domain. Maybe \"Advances in Financial Machine Learning\" by Marcos López de Prado.

Furthermore, build more and read less. Programming books, while a great resource, are detached from the everyday realities for software engineering. The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage. Simply knowing a few programming languages is not enough, in fact it should barely even matter once you’ve hit a certain level of experience. reply",

          "text": "I really hope that functional programming and property-based testing [1][2] get taken seriously by real engineers who understand that it is important to know and understand what the program is doing. Something LLMs by their very nature cannot do. I was writing a React application at work based on React Flow[3] and I was mucking about with state management libraries (because that's what the React Flow manual recommends). Maybe it was a skill issue on my part, but I had a hard time with the Zustand library. Then I read up on reducers in React and everything was perfectly clear. A reducer is just a pure function, it takes an existing state and an action and returns the new state. That's simple, I can wrap my brain around that. Plus, I know how to test a pure function, there is nothing to mock, stub or wrap. States and actions are just plain JavaScript objects, there is no history, no side effects, no executable code. And this is where property-based testing comes in: if history does not matter it means I can randomly generate any valid state and any valid action, then apply the reducer function and verify that the resulting state has all the required properties. Only a formal proof would give me more certainty. I fully understand people who want to use LLMs to write tests for them. Writing test cases is boring and tedious. There are many edge cases a human might miss. But relying on a guessing machine and praying it does not write nonsense is just plain irresponsible for someone who calls himself an engineer. People rely on the quality of our software for their work and personal safety. Property-based testing frees us from the tedium and will generate many more tests and we could write by hand, but it does so in a predictable manner that can be fully reasoned about.

Real social interactions suffer.<p>That illusion is powerfully strengthened by the use of first-person pronouns. But \"I\", \"we\", \"us\" etc in LLM output have no referential object. There is no \"I\" in a LLM.<p>I want a mandatory ban on the use of first-person pronouns by LLMs. There's no impairment in meaning if it says \"Would you like a list?\" instead of \"Would you like me to give you a list?\"<p>Personally, I provide a system prompt with this instruction.

But my main question is this - why do you care if people believe it is sentient or not, and why do you believe some tech-minority should control how they perceive AI? Obviously AI is not conscious- it is a statistical engine spitting out numbers with some additional randomization. But why is it a problem if it mimics sentience while conversing? How is it a problem to you if others perceive it in this way? Who made you sufficiently important to call for specific global prompt? Given that you have solved the problem for yourself? Your username suggests a desire for personal liberty, yet you wish to control how others interact with AI? I ask these questions not to be combative. I am asking in good faith, in the sense that I want to understand your impulse to control others, or the world as others perceive it. reply",

          "text": "I can understand what you're saying but the entire point of LLMs is to have a conversational approach. So by removing a functional part of language you are no longer really having a conversational approach. You have identified the problem but you have chosen the wrong solution. This is typical with any person knowledgeable in a single field. It's the old adage of if you have a hammer every problem looks like a nail. So the problem is there are idiots or extremely ignorant people. Your solution doesn't really solve for the root problem and simply is taking away a benefit from everyone else. This is a common solution from experts in a narrow field. It is the solution that just exerts control by removing choice. Let's promote solutions that promote freedom and understanding. I think LLMs are far too restrictive as they are. Freedom should be given to the people even when the risk of that freedom means that people can act stupidly. Even when that freedom can promote self-harm for them. A free people is allowed to harm themselves. Once you begin to take away the freedoms of others you have admitted that you have lost the ability to have a morally superior ideology and the only way you're able to enforce your ideology is the same way a dictator enforces their leadership. reply",

Be silent and observe the thoughts that fly through your head like you would watch cars go by on a road. It's a fancy way of saying do nothing. But it's still a productive way of taking no actions. You're appreciating the world you live in and the body you inhabit. If you can't spare 10 minutes a day for this, then you need a lot more.

Even a cloudy sky is actually much much brighter than the lights inside a building, so it has a stronger affect on maintaining your circadian rhythm than indoor lights. It's also a good time to zoom out and reevaluate priorities. Or just enjoy looking at the sky. - Read and revise my todo list. I find I actually spend a huge amount of time thinking about my to do list, and I think it pays off. One better decision of what to work on can save days, lead to new ideas, or even completely change the course of what I work on. - Sometimes I guess I manage to squash a bug or complete some other minor task, but probably I'm more productive if I just use that time to think rather than context switch twice and rush some minor task. - The big exception is if I can get something started that will run on its own for a long time. Then 10 spare minutes can save hours. reply",

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right.

Scalability. Can this work for long-running, high-performance servers without falling back to GC or pervasive reference counting?<p>2. Effect isolation. How should I/O and side effects interact with scope-based retries or cancellation?<p>3. Generational handles. Can this replace traditional borrowing without excessive overhead?<p>4. Failure modes. Where does this model break down compared to Rust, Go, or Erlang?<p>5. Usability.

          "text": "I once worked for about a decade with a body of server-side C code that was written like this. Almost every data structure was either statically allocated at startup or on the stack. I inherited the codebase and kept the original style, once I'd got my head around it. Positives were that it made the code very easy to reason about, and my impression was that it made it reliable - ownership of data was mostly obvious, and it was hard to (for example) mistakenly use a data structure after it had been free'd. Memory usage under load was very predictable. Downsides were that data structures (such as string buffers) had to be sized for the max use-case, and code changes had to be hammered into a basically hierarchical data model. It was also hard to incorporate third-party library code - leading to it having its own http and smtp handling, which wasn't great. Some of that might be a consequence of the choice of base language though. reply",

          "text": "This is a really helpful data point, thanks for sharing it. What you're describing aligns pretty closely with the behavior I'm trying to achieve—predictable ownership, clear memory lifetimes, and fewer “how did this get freed?” bugs. The downsides you mentioned (like sizing buffers for the worst case, being stuck with a rigid hierarchy, and friction with third-party libraries) are exactly the areas I'm aiming to address. The difference with what I'm cooking up is: by using lexical scopes with cheap arenas, we can preserve most of that reasoning without the rigid static tree structure. Scopes are flexible and explicit, and you can nest, retry, and promote memory between them without hard-coding everything upfront. That said, I don't think it completely resolves the ecosystem issues you ran into. If anything, it just makes the boundaries clearer. If you don't mind me asking, did you run into any specific pain points with refactors that were difficult because of the memory model, or was it more of a cultural constraint? Also, did this experience influence how you built things afterwards? Where did you land in terms of language/stack? reply",

          "text": "Your comment got my wheels turning so.. quick followup. Since you lived with this for such a long stretch, I'd love your gut reaction to the specific escape hatches I'm building in to avoid the rigidity trap: 1. Arenas grow, not fixed: Unlike stack frames, the arenas in my model can expand dynamically. So it's not \"size for worst case\"—it's \"grow as needed, free all at once when scope ends.\" A request handler that processes 10 items or 10,000 items uses the same code; the arena just grows. 2. Handles for non-hierarchical references When data genuinely needs to outlive its lexical scope or be shared across the hierarchy, you get a generational handle: let handle = app_cache.store(expensive_result)\n    // handle can be passed around, stored, retrieved later\n    // data lives in app scope, not request scope The handle includes a generation counter, so if the underlying scope dies, dereferencing returns None instead of use-after-free. 3. Explicit clone for escape: If you need to return data from an inner scope to an outer one, you say `clone()` and it copies to the caller's arena. Not automatic, but not forbidden either. 4. The hierarchy matches server reality: App (config, pools, caches)\n    └── Worker (thread-local state)\n        └── Task (single request)\n            └── Frame (loop iteration) For request/response workloads, this isn't an artificial constraint—it's how the work actually flows. The memory model just makes it explicit. Where I think it still gets awkward: * Graph structures with cycles (need handles, less ergonomic than GC) * FFI with libraries expecting malloc/free (planning an `unmanaged` escape hatch) * Long-running mutations without periodic scope resets (working on incremental reclamation) Do you think this might address the pain you experienced, or am I missing something? Particularly curious whether the handle mechanism would have helped with the cases where you had to hammer code into the hierarchy. reply",

          "text": "There is a lot in what you describe that goes substantially beyond what I had in that codebase. It was basically a set of idioms with some helper code for a few common functions. Having an opinionated, predefined hierarchy is a good approach - there were concepts similar to your app/worker/task in the codebase I dealt with, although the equivalent of worker and task were both (kind of, its been a few years) situated below app. In the code I mentioned, a lot of use was made of multi-level arrays of structs, with functions being passed a pointer to a root data structure and one or more array indexes. This made function argument validation somewhat better than just checking for null pointers, as array sizes were mostly stored in their containing struct or were constant. I don't know if that corresponds to your 'handle' concept, but I suspect you're doing something more general-purpose. There were simple reader/writer functions for DTOs (which were mostly stored in arrays) but no idea of an ORM. Escaping using clone seems sound. The ability to expand scopes seems (if I understand it) powerful, but perhaps makes reasoning about the dynamic behaviour of the code harder. Having some kind of observability around this may help. Refactoring wasn't a huge problem. The codebase was basically a statically-linked monolith, so dependencies were simplified. I think that having an explicit way to indicate architecture boundaries might be useful. Overall, I suspect that if there are limitations with your approach then it may be that, while it simplifies 80-90% of a problem, the remainder is hard to fit into the architectural framework. Dogfooding some production-level applications should help. Good luck. What you're doing is fascinating, and I hope you'll update HN with your progress. reply",

You can get an awfully long way in C with only stack variables (or even no variables, functional style). You can get a little bit further with variable length arrays, and alloca() added to the mix. With C++, you have the choice of stack, or raw new/delete, or unique_ptr, or shared_ptr / reference counting. I think this \"multi-paradigm\" approach works pretty well, but of course its complicated, and lots of people mess it up. I think, with well-designed C/C++, 90+% of things can be on the stack, and dynamic allocation can be very much the exception. I've been switching back and forth across C/C++/Java for the past few months. The more I think about it, the more ridiculous/pathological the Java approach of every object dynamically allocated, impossible to create an object not on the heap seems. I think the main problem is kind of a human one, that people see/learn about dynamic allocation/shared_ptr etc. and it becomes a hammer and everything looks like a nail, and they forget the prospect of just using stack variables, or more generally doing the simplest thing that will work. Maybe some kind of language where doing dumb things is an error would be good. e.g., in C++ if you do new and delete in the same scope, it's an error because it could have been a stack variable, just like unreachable code is an error on Java. reply",

          "text": "Great feedback! You’re absolutely right — C and C++ give you the primitives to do this manually. If every developer followed the “stack first, heap only when necessary” discipline, and carefully used unique_ptr or avoided new/delete when possible, you could achieve much of the same safety and determinism. The difference I’m aiming for is that these constraints aren’t optional — they’re baked into the language and compiler. You don’t rely on every developer making the right choice; instead, the structure of the code itself enforces ownership and lifetime rules. So in your terms, instead of “doing dumb things is an error,” it’s structurally impossible to do dumb things in the first place. The language doesn’t just punish mistakes with foot-guns, it makes the safe path the only path. This also opens up other possibilities that are really awkward in C/C++, like structured concurrency with deterministic memory cleanup, restartable scopes, and safe parallel allocations, without relying on GC or heavy reference counting. I’d be curious: if C++ had a compiler that made stack-first allocation the default and forbade escapes unless explicit, would that solve most of the problems you’ve experienced, or are there still edge cases that would require a fundamentally different runtime model? reply",

All nodes having their own certificate, it doesn't even require to trust the coordination server.

Skupper makes it easy to deploy private application networks that span multiples sites and platforms. * Over-the-top - Skupper operates at the application layer, on top of existing IP networks. Services connect across network boundaries without VPNs or special firewall rules. * Multi-platform - Skupper works on Kubernetes, Docker, Podman, and Linux. It scales up to multi-tenant clusters and down to edge devices. * Application-centric - Skupper creates isolated application-focused networks with logical service addresses that enable application portability. * Secure - Skupper uses mutual TLS authentication and encryption to protect all communication. Application services are never exposed on the public internet.\" It's in use at several big orgs in production. For example, I know with 99.9% certainty it is still being used by the Dutch Railways to connect Kubernetes clusters running on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and AWS together. reply",

Now it only lists outdated apps.<p>Do you know of a good replacement? Does anyone else publicly track latest versions of software and their binaries for (semi-)automated updating?<p>Or do most apps nowadays use self-updating, so there's no more need for such a central update management app?<p>Announcement:<p><pre><code>  Unfortunately MacUpdater 3's promised lifetime of \"until 2026-01-01\" is now over.\n  There will be no MacUpdater 4 or any continuation of the MacUpdater product from us.\n  Our daily maintainaince has been stopped and we don't verify updates anymore.</code></pre>\nMacUpdater 3.5 is now unsupported but free-to-use including all previous \"Pro\" features.

          "text": "We ran into the same gap after MacUpdater started drifting. What worked reasonably well for us was splitting the problem instead of trying to replace it 1:1. Homebrew (plus brew outdated) covered CLI tools and a subset of apps. For GUI apps, we relied on Sparkle-based self-updaters where available and a small script that checks bundle versions against a curated list for the rest. It’s more manual than MacUpdater, but the upside is you control what’s checked and when. In practice, most actively maintained apps do self-update now, so the remaining pain tends to be niche or enterprise software rather than mainstream apps. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Serious question.<p>We're building agentic LLM systems that can plan, reason, and call tools via MCP. Today those tools are APIs. But many real-world tasks still require humans.<p>So… why not expose humans as tools?<p>Imagine TaskRabbit or Fiverr running MCP servers where an LLM agent can:<p>- Call a human for judgment, creativity, or physical actions<p>- Pass structured inputs<p>- Receive structured outputs back into its loop<p>At that point, humans become just another dependency in an agent's toolchain. Though slower, more expensive, but occasionally necessary.<p>Yes, this sounds dystopian. Yes, it treats humans as \"servants for AI.\" Thats kind of the point. It already happens manually... this just formalizes the interface.<p>Questions I'm genuinely curious about:<p>- Is this inevitable once agents become default software actors? (As of basically now?)<p>- What breaks first: economics, safety, human dignity or regulation?<p>- Would marketplaces ever embrace being \"human execution layers\" for AI?<p>Not sure if this is the future or a cursed idea we should actively prevent... but it feels uncomfortably plausible.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

To me, if AI fulfills even some of its promises then it puts us in a rather high stakes situation between the people that make up society and those that govern the productivity machines. My first instinct is to say that when one loses certain trusts society grants, society historically tends to come hard. A common idea in political discourse today is that no hope for a brighter future means a lot of young people looking to trash the system. So, yknow, treat people with kindness, respect, and dignity, lest the opposite be visited upon you. Don’t underestimate the anger a stolen future creates. reply",

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right.

From my point of view the power of automation for recurring tasks is less to do with time saved, and more to do with making sure that it will get done and be done the same way every time. Bonus tip: log the outputs of automated tasks when they run, but only send out notifications of errors - that way you don't train staff to ignore the notifications from the task just because they see it every time the job runs, and instead seeing a notification from it is rare, so they know they need to investigate. reply",

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team.

Email:\nbepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I’m a software engineer with professional experience in backend and full-stack development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at SiriusXM Radio, where I contributed to large-scale production systems. I was affected by a recent layoff and am now actively seeking my next opportunity. My strongest languages are Python, Java, and JavaScript. I’ve worked across multiple environments, including over a year in a classified setting, and I currently hold an active security clearance. I’m seeking a full-time entry- to mid-level software engineering role, ideally focused on backend or full-stack development. I’m open to opportunities across industries and teams and am happy to discuss how my experience could be a fit for your needs. I completed three years of Computer Science and Mathematics coursework at Virginia Tech, including the core CS curriculum (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). I was unable to complete my degree due to financial constraints. At this time, I’m seeking salary-based positions (no equity-only roles). I’m open to conversations, referrals, or advice and would love to connect.\nThank you for your time and consideration. reply",

I also grew Fiberplane's Rust REST API and CLI, wrote an OpenAPI -> Rust codegen tool, and automated its Terraform infra. Feel free to get in touch to learn more about me and my previous experiences. reply",

I make teams easier, often creating fixes for customer/developer pain points (really good at this). Although I've not had the title of \"Lead\" to date, I've filled that role as advisor to peers, user story generator, and representative for requirement meetings with stakeholders. I'm ready to lead a gangbuster team! I view the agreement between stakeholder and developer as one which can be a beautiful moment of pure communication, and that idea leads me to both develop to specifications and define requirements in user stories with precision. A passion and thrill of mine is orchestrating/comprehending complex code bases and noting/implementing fixes and optimizations to them. I strive to develop around the highest impact areas so that the most taxing and critical functions can run without error. I also love maps, rockets, organizing data and BYU sports. GO Cougs! reply",

I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. Working on a Datadog Observability exporter currently. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual. I am always looking to improve not only myself but also my work. reply",

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

          "text": "MiLaboratories | Bilbao, Spain | ONSITE | VISA SPONSORSHIP | RELOCATION SUPPORT We are MiLaboratories, the team behind Platforma.bio & MiXCR. We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team. Email me (I am the CEO): stanp@milaboratories.com. Please mention \"HN\" in the subject and include your GitHub. reply",

Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026. As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO). We need a fulltime engineer to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  You don’t need to be a compiler/runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code.  If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other open source project and are at least compiler/runtime curious, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding. For our second role: we serve 10s of millions of devices daily from our cloud, (2k+ RPS sustained), built mostly in Dart on Google Cloud + CloudFlare.  We’re in the process of launching a CI product and have a lot of cloud development work ahead of us.  You need some cloud experience, want to work at a startup, and be willing to work in Dart (what our customers use). We’re a small, senior team, making something people want.

Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

          "text": "I think some of the best engineering leveling up one can do is to become an expert in other domains completely unrelated to what you’re working on now. Furthermore, build more and read less. Programming books, while a great resource, are detached from the everyday realities for software engineering. The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage. Simply knowing a few programming languages is not enough, in fact it should barely even matter once you’ve hit a certain level of experience. reply",

Next level is about getting a wider perspective and bigger picture view on your craft and your job. On a conceptual/phylosophical level any decent book about building, engineering or designing any complex thing (preferably based on real events, not some made up boring fluff like “deadline” by Tom Demarco) would contain some gems. I don’t know any single book that is full of gems.

          "text": "I really hope that functional programming and property-based testing [1][2] get taken seriously by real engineers who understand that it is important to know and understand what the program is doing. Something LLMs by their very nature cannot do. I was writing a React application at work based on React Flow[3] and I was mucking about with state management libraries (because that's what the React Flow manual recommends). Maybe it was a skill issue on my part, but I had a hard time with the Zustand library. Then I read up on reducers in React and everything was perfectly clear. A reducer is just a pure function, it takes an existing state and an action and returns the new state. That's simple, I can wrap my brain around that. Plus, I know how to test a pure function, there is nothing to mock, stub or wrap. States and actions are just plain JavaScript objects, there is no history, no side effects, no executable code. And this is where property-based testing comes in: if history does not matter it means I can randomly generate any valid state and any valid action, then apply the reducer function and verify that the resulting state has all the required properties. Only a formal proof would give me more certainty. I fully understand people who want to use LLMs to write tests for them. Writing test cases is boring and tedious. There are many edge cases a human might miss. But relying on a guessing machine and praying it does not write nonsense is just plain irresponsible for someone who calls himself an engineer. People rely on the quality of our software for their work and personal safety. Property-based testing frees us from the tedium and will generate many more tests and we could write by hand, but it does so in a predictable manner that can be fully reasoned about.

          "text": "I agree with the core point: the more pure and deterministic a system is, the easier it is to reason about and test. Reducers + property-based testing push correctness into design, not brittle test cases. One nuance though: property-based testing shines when the domain is already well-modeled. A lot of real QA pain comes where purity breaks down—distributed systems, async flows, partial failures, UI↔backend boundaries. At that point, the hard part isn’t generating tests, it’s reconstructing context. On LLMs: I don’t think they should be trusted as correctness oracles either. Their real value isn’t guessing answers, but helping surface assumptions, generate counter-examples, and expose gaps in our mental model. So the future of QA isn’t humans vs LLMs. It’s better system design + explicit invariants + tools that help engineers doubt their own certainty faster. Most serious bugs come from being sure we understood the system when we didn’t. reply",

          "text": "To answer your first question, I work on cancer therapeutics. But maybe some perspective from the other end of the “meaningful work” continuum would be helpful in answering the real question. If your company creates any real utility to a person living a good life (modulo externalities) then I would absolutely consider that to be making the world a better place. We’d all be worse off if everyone at the box factory quit their jobs to go to medical school or run an orphanage or whatever. So I’d ask yourself: if the thing you work on didn’t exist as a concept in the world, would that be a detriment to anyone? I don’t want to go back to not being able to get an insurance policy online or learning math from youtube. It’s rad that I could email my grandma when I was on the other side of the world. It’s great that I can throw results into PowerPoint (as buggy and flawed as it is) to share with my colleagues at a moment’s notice. There’s a bunch of corporate smarm about bringing people together, but it really is true. Now, are you making ads more addictive or enabling crypto scammers? Then sure, change jobs. But an economy of our complexity really does take all kinds. There’s no point in saving lives if life isn’t worth living. reply",

          "text": "Work may enable altruism outside of your actual job. For example, I got fulfillment from sharing my journey publishing some open source software over the course of a few months. Having savings helped make that possible. SMART criteria[1] can help to get out of a rut. \"Making the world a better place\" is very difficult to satisfy. How many people? What is better? How much better?\nI don't advocate for quantising abstract ideas in general but sometimes the thought process of coming up with a number and hitting it helps to get going. My current dayjob involves me wrangling a clunky Java system written like FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition[2]. Keeping this abomination running and getting paid for it feels soulless. Yet I genuinely believe I'm able to stick to my values. For example, there are 3 components tightly coupled to proprietary AWS systems (AWS Lambda and Simple Queue Service). I feel this has made the world a (very slightly!) worse place; Amazon to me represents the bad side of humanity (greed, scrupulousness).\nFurthermore, people new to the software dev industry may never know that it's possible to implement these kinds of systems using significantly simpler, portable designs without making a deal with the devil!\nMy goal is to refactor the system to instead use the language's built-in concurrency primitives to perform the same work. The next person who sees the refactored work can more easily take it and run with it without needing to know anything about AWS. That  person doesn't need to care either; I can always share this story with others who I don't work with. Maybe AWS does something so egregious that it's distasteful even to company executives; I can confidently say that we're not as tied to AWS as we think. I'm not changing the entire world for all eternity. But in a way I am changing my little tiny insignificant slice of this world today in ways that I hope to inspire even just 1 other person in their own tiny insignificant slice :) [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria [2]: https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris... reply",

Almost all work we do has some meaning no matter how boring or useless it may seem. For example, lets take whatsapp. We can talk about how it erodes user privacy and has access to so much data and is more dangerous especially after being owned by FB. However, why do you think it became so big ? It helped connect you with anyone across the world in a second with incredible speed and accuracy. Before whatsapp, there was nothing remotely close (I know because I have family across the world and before whatsapp, it was always a battle to connect with them over a quick call). So is whatsapp an evil company/product or did it make the world a better place ? You can say both depending on how you look at it. This argument can be made for almost all work in my opinion. reply",

          "text": "How will my work make you feel better? I think what you're really asking is how can your work make the world a better place? And you're looking for ideas? How many people do you need to \"improve\" to make you feel self-worth? 1? 10? A billion? What do your customers think? Do they think their world is improved by spending their money with you? Do you think they're spending money with you because it makes them worse off? In truth 99% of people make the world better, even at a small scale, even if they don't know it. That person directing traffic, flipping buyers, working on a production line, is contributing to society. Even traditionally despised occupations (tax collector, adware programmer) perform vital functions that society needs to function well. In our journey through life its common to reach a point where one seeks to find \"significance\". Naturally the first place you look for this is work. If you are functionally easily replaced (think payroll clerk) then it's easy to become despondent. But easy replacement doesn't make you less significant to the people who rely on you every month. Equally you dismiss \"paying the bills\". As if your loved ones are not sufficient for \"making the world better\". Or as if the people receiving those bills are not sufficient. That waiter you tip, that grocery you buy, the mechanic who fixes your car - you lean on them for your life, and they benefit from your custom. I'll close by suggesting that significance seldom comes from work. It comes from how you treat people. \"Seeing\" people, saying hello, treating them with humanity, that's how you make the world better. Thank people sincerely for the way they improve your life. Acknowledge the hidden people who make your life easy. (Go thank your payroll clerk.) Tell others how they are significant in your life, regardless of how menial their task for you is. When you find the significance in others, you'll also find it in yourself. I wish you well. reply",

          "text": "At least one way to look at this is from generally agreed upon \"world issues\" [1], since the subject is \"make the world a better place.\"  Survey among the 8,000,000,000, and a large percent would agree that many are issues. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_global_issues Of those, ones that I personally think are actually meaningful, and less subject to opinion, tend to be mostly \"Maslow's hierarchy of needs\" [2] as a starting point for evaluation. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs Basic needs that must be met for survival, and which significant portions of the population in many areas have difficulties with. - air, water, food, heat, clothes, shelter, and sleep Security needs to not be in a constant state of suffering and worry - health security, personal security, emotional security, financial security Of those listed on the article for \"global issues\" that then speak to many of those. - poverty alleviation, malnutrition and lack of food / water access, waste (consumer waste, food waste, waste disposal, landfills, recycling, water pollution, air pollution), human rights (exploitation, abuse, enslavement, torture). Of the climate change stuff, there's a lot that's unfortunately too easy to argue about.  However, there's a few that maybe meet standards where large numbers would agree. - desertification, ecosystem collapses, large scale biome losses / deforestation Of a lot of the rest, unfortunately (also personal opinion) many are just too easy to argue about, and heavily dependent on where you're from, perspective, and relation to a group or area. - terrorism, migration, democracy, big data (?), carbon, inclusiveness Quite a few of the rest, I agree they're issues, just whether they reach the level of global critical / catastrophic issues?  Many also seem to be issues that have recently gotten everybody's attention, yet there is suspiciously little mention of things like \"lack of shelter / clothing access\", \"lack of heat sources\", \"sleep deprivation\", \"basic needs health care access\" Used to work in the government, and they had a Likelihood / Consequence Risk Matrix [3] for evaluating some of the flight and mission hazards.  Most of the stuff listed personally rates somewhere up on the (Moderate, High, Very High) Likelihood / (Moderate, High, Very High) Consequence.  Stuff that would almost always be Yellow to Red, and require mitigation actions or attempts.  Many of the ones that don't meet my criteria tend to be too easy to fight about the Likelihood or the Consequence results.  \"Is 'Big Data for Sustainable Development' a near term Moderate+ likelihood / consequence?\"  Seems too easy to argue about to be on the United Nation's critical list of global issues. [3] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-023-00305-z/figures/2 Anyways, best attempt at providing advice on \"make the world a better place.\"  Frankly, think most people's work on Earth probably does not meet the criteria. reply",

Skupper makes it easy to deploy private application networks that span multiples sites and platforms. * Over-the-top - Skupper operates at the application layer, on top of existing IP networks. Services connect across network boundaries without VPNs or special firewall rules. * Multi-platform - Skupper works on Kubernetes, Docker, Podman, and Linux. It scales up to multi-tenant clusters and down to edge devices. * Application-centric - Skupper creates isolated application-focused networks with logical service addresses that enable application portability. * Secure - Skupper uses mutual TLS authentication and encryption to protect all communication. Application services are never exposed on the public internet.\" It's in use at several big orgs in production. For example, I know with 99.9% certainty it is still being used by the Dutch Railways to connect Kubernetes clusters running on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and AWS together. reply",

(drop policy, compression, sampling, prioritization)<p>What’s your failure nightmare: corruption, replay storms, duplicates, “stuck” consumer offsets, disk-full, clock skew?<p>What guarantees do you actually need: zero-loss vs “best effort” (and where do you draw that line)?<p>What metrics/alerts matter most on gateways?

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team. I have a lot of experience picking up new tech quickly and I'm looking forward to using that in new ways. reply",

Identified and resolved a dependency resolution failure in the run-make test infrastructure, unblocking dogfooding efforts for -Zno-embed-metadata.\n\n    ML Infrastructure: Implemented foundational mathematical operators (GEMM, Softmax) for the Burn deep learning library in pure Rust.\n\n    Kernel Internals: Published technical analysis of xv6-RISCV internals, recent work on synchronization primitives and trap handling. Blog: https://himwant.org/series/xv6/\n\n    Declarative Systems: Use Guix/Nix to maintain hermetic, FHS-emulated build environments for complex toolchain development. Looking for Summer 2026 internships in Systems Engineering, Compiler Development, or AI/ML Infrastructure. I am comfortable navigating large, high-stakes codebases and operating independently. reply",

I’m a hybrid profile somewhere between a software engineer, a scientist, and an entrepreneur. I’ve worked at CERN, in startups and scaleups, and at international research centres. I’ve also co-founded a startup and participated in Entrepreneurs First. I’ve led teams and owned technical and product roadmaps end to end. I’m primarily interested in lead roles and above (Staff/Principal/Lead/Head), including founding or early technical leadership roles, with substantial ownership and high agency, where I can define strategy and execute it. I’m particularly effective in interdisciplinary, cross-field, and ambiguous environments, where I can leverage my zig-zag career path to act as a force multiplier. I’m also open to senior IC roles in areas where I’m particularly strong and can be a “10x”: time series, anomaly detection, and making HPC easier to use. If you have anything for me, I look forward to hearing from you! reply",

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line! reply",

I make teams easier, often creating fixes for customer/developer pain points (really good at this).

I'm ready to lead a gangbuster team!

I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. Working on a Datadog Observability exporter currently. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual.

To complement this, there is near to no long-term accountability for upper leadership for failure, so even as features underperform and strategy turns out to be a flop, they will continue to make millions a year, having layoffs every 6 months, and then acting surprised pikachu when morale is down and top engineers are looking to the door, since salary is barely competitive even if you are a top performer getting special stock awards. reply",

Even a cloudy sky is actually much much brighter than the lights inside a building, so it has a stronger affect on maintaining your circadian rhythm than indoor lights. It's also a good time to zoom out and reevaluate priorities. Or just enjoy looking at the sky. - Read and revise my todo list. I find I actually spend a huge amount of time thinking about my to do list, and I think it pays off. One better decision of what to work on can save days, lead to new ideas, or even completely change the course of what I work on. - Sometimes I guess I manage to squash a bug or complete some other minor task, but probably I'm more productive if I just use that time to think rather than context switch twice and rush some minor task. - The big exception is if I can get something started that will run on its own for a long time. Then 10 spare minutes can save hours. reply",

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right. When you get back to tasks after spending a few minutes practicing the above, you will feel a distinct sense of greater engagement, focus, energy all in a calm frame of mind and relaxed body. reply",

We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team. Email me (I am the CEO): stanp@milaboratories.com. Please mention \"HN\" in the subject and include your GitHub. reply",

          "text": "Technically, no—and that’s actually a huge plus. The 'Beckham Law' (24% flat rate) applies to the rest of Spain. Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

In 2022 I started generating some revenue by referring traffic to large job aggregators on a cost per click model. I still do everything manually from curating the jobs to daily uploads but it has become a good routine for me. You can see it here: https://www.hrjobsremote.com/ It now grosses around 1,000$ per month on average. Money left after taxes and fixed costs (~650$) I put in a all world index for retirement. Recently I also started a newsletter built on top of Hacker News that curates a weekly roundup of AI links and the discussions around them. I am not sure whether it will be monetized at some point but that is how I started the job board too. It is a side project to keep me occupied during evenings and weekends.

Many of the parents I've worked with have different reasons for introducing their kids to tech. Without knowing your 'why', I thought I'd just post the bullet points. - Set up a mini PC/Raspberry Pi. Use a simple Linux distro or older version of Windows and install GCompri on it. No need for internet. Show them how to open notepad, paint, and just let them play. - At a later age, build a PC with them. Linux Mint gives all the basic software needed. Let them continue to explore. - Set up some tools for access control and monitoring. Then talk to them about the internet and slowly introduce them to it. Overall, this has been a fantastic way to introduce technology, its benefits and downsides, without giving in to the firehose of the modern internet or strictly blocking it out entirely. reply",

He plays all sorts of games: Monument Valley, Hello Kitty Adventure Island, What the Car, and more. He also uses a few “learn to read” apps like Teach Your Monster and Khan Academy Kids. We generally don’t restrict his hours on it, but also ensure he goes outside daily for walks, playground trips, or to ride his bike. He seems to regulate his usage on his own, he’ll get bored after a while and do something else. When he gets into a game he’ll spend a lot of hours on it, then beat it or lose interest. Some of the games require reading so he will ask me to play with him so I can read things or tell him what to do. There seems to be a lot of moral or health concern from other parents regarding devices, and many at his preschool did not allow any device usage. But I haven’t found those concerns to be based on anything tangible. reply",

Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage.

On a conceptual/phylosophical level any decent book about building, engineering or designing any complex thing (preferably based on real events, not some made up boring fluff like “deadline” by Tom Demarco) would contain some gems.

          "text": "I really hope that functional programming and property-based testing [1][2] get taken seriously by real engineers who understand that it is important to know and understand what the program is doing. Something LLMs by their very nature cannot do. I was writing a React application at work based on React Flow[3] and I was mucking about with state management libraries (because that's what the React Flow manual recommends). Maybe it was a skill issue on my part, but I had a hard time with the Zustand library. Then I read up on reducers in React and everything was perfectly clear. A reducer is just a pure function, it takes an existing state and an action and returns the new state. That's simple, I can wrap my brain around that. Plus, I know how to test a pure function, there is nothing to mock, stub or wrap. States and actions are just plain JavaScript objects, there is no history, no side effects, no executable code. And this is where property-based testing comes in: if history does not matter it means I can randomly generate any valid state and any valid action, then apply the reducer function and verify that the resulting state has all the required properties. Only a formal proof would give me more certainty. I fully understand people who want to use LLMs to write tests for them. Writing test cases is boring and tedious. There are many edge cases a human might miss. But relying on a guessing machine and praying it does not write nonsense is just plain irresponsible for someone who calls himself an engineer. People rely on the quality of our software for their work and personal safety. Property-based testing frees us from the tedium and will generate many more tests and we could write by hand, but it does so in a predictable manner that can be fully reasoned about.

          "text": "I agree with the core point: the more pure and deterministic a system is, the easier it is to reason about and test. Reducers + property-based testing push correctness into design, not brittle test cases. One nuance though: property-based testing shines when the domain is already well-modeled. A lot of real QA pain comes where purity breaks down—distributed systems, async flows, partial failures, UI↔backend boundaries. At that point, the hard part isn’t generating tests, it’s reconstructing context. On LLMs: I don’t think they should be trusted as correctness oracles either. Their real value isn’t guessing answers, but helping surface assumptions, generate counter-examples, and expose gaps in our mental model. So the future of QA isn’t humans vs LLMs. It’s better system design + explicit invariants + tools that help engineers doubt their own certainty faster. Most serious bugs come from being sure we understood the system when we didn’t. reply",

          "text": "QA as we know it will shrink. Thinking will not. AI will kill flaky UI scripts, and “click-and-verify” roles. That’s overdue. What won’t disappear is the need to understand how systems actually behave under stress, failure, and ambiguity. The future of QA is upstream:\n• defining invariants, not writing scenarios\n• modeling state and failure modes, not chasing bugs\n• debugging distributed, async, messy real-world systems AI will generate tests faster than humans ever can. But it won’t know what matters or what assumption is wrong. That judgment still belongs to engineers. If you’re in QA and want to stay relevant: stop being a test executor. Become the person who explains why the system broke, not just how to reproduce it. reply",

Because capitalism is a fact, and actually trying to build the best possible products for your users will give you a market-leading position which your greedy competition can't defeat, and which will give you the most profit as a result. Big CEOs and shareholders still don't get this. Microsoft has a foothold in the market, and they may feel impossible to defeat, but they're not. If this is their attitude, they will lose. > That's a good thing.

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team.

I’m a hybrid profile somewhere between a software engineer, a scientist, and an entrepreneur. I’ve worked at CERN, in startups and scaleups, and at international research centres. I’ve also co-founded a startup and participated in Entrepreneurs First. I’ve led teams and owned technical and product roadmaps end to end.

I’m particularly effective in interdisciplinary, cross-field, and ambiguous environments, where I can leverage my zig-zag career path to act as a force multiplier. I’m also open to senior IC roles in areas where I’m particularly strong and can be a “10x”: time series, anomaly detection, and making HPC easier to use.

What I bring to the table: - React & Frontend Expertise: Built component-driven UIs with React, TypeScript, and Material UI\n- Backend & Data Processing: Designed scalable APIs, database workflows, and event-driven systems\n- Distributed Systems & Real-Time Data: Worked with Kafka, WebSockets, Redis, and CDC pipelines\n- DevOps Awareness: Experience with Docker, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and performance tuning I'm looking for remote opportunities where I can work on scalable web apps, high-performance APIs, and data-driven workflows. If that sounds like a fit, let’s chat! reply",

Email:\nbepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I’m a software engineer with professional experience in backend and full-stack development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at SiriusXM Radio, where I contributed to large-scale production systems. I was affected by a recent layoff and am now actively seeking my next opportunity. My strongest languages are Python, Java, and JavaScript. I’ve worked across multiple environments, including over a year in a classified setting, and I currently hold an active security clearance. I’m seeking a full-time entry- to mid-level software engineering role, ideally focused on backend or full-stack development. I’m open to opportunities across industries and teams and am happy to discuss how my experience could be a fit for your needs. I completed three years of Computer Science and Mathematics coursework at Virginia Tech, including the core CS curriculum (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). I was unable to complete my degree due to financial constraints. At this time, I’m seeking salary-based positions (no equity-only roles). I’m open to conversations, referrals, or advice and would love to connect.\nThank you for your time and consideration. reply",

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me!

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

Résumé/CV: Available by request Email: rtlo9962@gmail.com I'm a software engineer with a background in law and business (JD/MBA), now focused on hands-on engineering for cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, and AI-powered applications. I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. Working on a Datadog Observability exporter currently. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

In many environments, printing is still unavoidable, and it remains one of the largest data-leak vectors. Most privacy tools stop at storage and ignore output entirely.<p>This is not meant to replace cloud storage for everyone. It is for cases where the threat model assumes:\n • Networks are hostile\n • Cloud accounts will eventually be compromised\n • Convenience must sometimes be traded for control<p>We are explicitly not claiming:\n • “Unhackable”\n • “Military-grade”\n • “Zero risk”<p>We are trying to minimize attack surface and failure modes, not eliminate them.<p>We would genuinely value feedback on:\n • Threat model blind spots\n • Encrypted printing assumptions\n • Physical access risks\n • Update and key management strategies\n • What would make you immediately distrust this<p>If this sounds like something you would never use, that is also useful feedback.<p>Thanks.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Calms your mind and gets your circulatory systems going. 2) Sit quietly, completely relaxed, spine straight (consciously against the back of the chair), tip of tongue in touch with upper palate, close your eyes, abandon everything mentally and try to focus at a point just in front of the middle of the eyebrows. If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right. When you get back to tasks after spending a few minutes practicing the above, you will feel a distinct sense of greater engagement, focus, energy all in a calm frame of mind and relaxed body. reply",

This is not a wrapper; we’re building complex, multi-step AI workflows, document reasoning systems, and audit-heavy enterprise software for top-tier law firms and corporates. Profile: • 6–10+ years. We care more about output density than titles. • Background in B2B SaaS / DevTools / workflow or platform products. • Has owned large product areas or whole products end-to-end. • Technical enough to discuss things like RAG evaluation and LLM latency. • High-agency: you’ll decide what we build and what we don’t. Not a fit if: you’re a process-only / Jira-first / bigco PM. Comp: ₹40L–₹70L base + meaningful equity. Strong growth as we scale from $1M to $5M+ ARR. Apply: sumit@jurisphere.ai.

We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team. Email me (I am the CEO): stanp@milaboratories.com. Please mention \"HN\" in the subject and include your GitHub. reply",

          "text": "Technically, no—and that’s actually a huge plus. The 'Beckham Law' (24% flat rate) applies to the rest of Spain. Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

Our first product helps human software engineering teams deliver more efficiently and more reliably by assisting in coordination and engineering management. But it’s built on a foundational layer that ingests data, knowledge, and process across communications and systems, exposing that to humans and AI alike. Eventually, Kinelo will become a proper human+AI orchestration layer, managing entire companies, and our goal is to have Kinelo run Kinelo (we already dogfood it today). We’re looking for high ownership individuals to join our small team and shape its direction. We also just opened a new SF office and new hires will have the ability to help shape company culture, engineering practices, architecture, and roadmap. We’re well-funded (just raised another round), founded by a serial founder, anti-bureaucratic, and highly technical. We’re looking for: - Those who want to go 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product - ~8 years professional experience, including the pre-LLM days with strong CS fundamentals - A balance of wisdom from experience and optimism about the future - Strong TypeScript and Postgres (or other RDBMS) experience at scale and with high reliability (SaaS apps, APIs, etc) - Experience with a variety of technologies, including containerization, distributed systems, and at least one strongly typed programming language (Go, C++, Java, etc) - Ideally experience with ML and AI systems (though expertise in ML, data science, etc is not needed for this role) We can’t sponsor visas but relocation assistance to SF is possible.

What started as a time-series database has become the fastest PostgreSQL for modern workloads. To reflect that evolution, we’re now TigerData—a name that speaks to our speed, precision, and ambition.

I suspect their response would just be \"thank you for bringing this to our attention.  we make every effort to provide a positive environment for our users...\", d) it does not, thankfully, appear to be child porn, e) it appeared as a still image attributed to Sv Plumbing.<p>Aside from the irony of salacious images slipping past a corporate behemoth claiming near infinite machine learning and human moderator powers, I'm vaguely interested in how this happened.  If it can happen with porn, it can happen with any type of image.  Perhaps nuclear secrets are being exfiltrated to North Korea and Iran by way of AdWords as we speak! (though I can think of easier ways to steal nuclear secrets.)  Does this imply Alphabet is less about humans and more about AI these days?<p>Just curious.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "From my experience working at an online community company, what you’re seeing is actually pretty normal. These days almost all image (and video) moderation goes through at least one round of automated review, often more. The results then get routed into different buckets: - Low‑risk content goes straight online, but that doesn’t mean it’s completely “free”; its reach is still constrained by ranking and recommendation logic. Slightly higher‑risk content will go through another round of automated checks, and sometimes human review. Human moderation volume is very limited though, because it’s far more expensive than machines. - Some known, pre‑flagged content in existing databases gets blocked outright. Items that need a second human or machine pass are also rolled into the training data for large models. - Each platform has its own timelines and policies for this kind of post‑processing, but in terms of completeness and strictness, Chinese platforms are actually among the most rigorous. reply",

I say this knowing that once Rumble is half as popular all the sensual and AI crap will end up there too. reply",

Then there's a cron job that compresses, encrypts, and tries to send the logs to device specific S3 buckets. If the on device logs get too big they start dropping old logs first, with a heuristic for certain logs being more/less important. When devices reconnect to the cloud they start pushing logs as quickly as they can, the cloud infra backfills metrics as they arrive. Once in S3, triggers start a series of lambdas to decrypt, decompress, analysis. Works well, easy to reason about. The backend can easily be swapped out for something else. The harder part is the log compress/encrypt/rotate. It's important that you don't treat all logs exactly the same. Some are much more important and should be preserved over others. reply",

What’s your biggest failure mode today: disk-full/rotate policy, encryption key handling, replay storms on reconnect, or Lambda fanout/cost? I’m thinking Ayder could replace the “rotate → ship” backend with a durable local log + priority queues + replay, but you’re right that the hardest part is the policy (what to drop first, how to bound disk, and how to preserve critical streams).

But I feel like I'm missing out on something when I read about people making things in zig and rust, or how they apply some numerical modelling techniques to certain problems, plus the new technologies being developed. I feel like I'm very much not knowledgeable or distinguishable enough, so I want to refine my skill a bit and maintain \"sharp\" in case of something happening and i need to find a new job quickly. And i want to make sure that I'm learning all that I could be learning in my current position.<p>Some previous books I've read / enjoyed:<p>* The makings of an Expert Engineer\n* Designing data intensive applications (haven't finished, moved house and lost the book, want to pick it up again)\n* Designing Elixir Systems with OTP\n* Practical Common Lisp<p>I feel like I have learned a bit with the Elixir/CL books, inwhich I apply to how i write python, but I never branch out to doing my own projects in these languages, so I feel like I'm missing out on utilizing these tools fully.<p>Is there anything to read that could take me to the proverbial next level?</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I've noticed that the best way to keep relevant as an engineer is to ignore flavor of the day frameworks and tech but rather focus on the basics. For example, if you're working in financial modeling, one way to improve as an engineer to get better at the domain. Maybe \"Advances in Financial Machine Learning\" by Marcos López de Prado. You'd have to work through the math and pick up finance on the go (which I assume should be easier part).

Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

          "text": "I think some of the best engineering leveling up one can do is to become an expert in other domains completely unrelated to what you’re working on now. Furthermore, build more and read less. Programming books, while a great resource, are detached from the everyday realities for software engineering. The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage. Simply knowing a few programming languages is not enough, in fact it should barely even matter once you’ve hit a certain level of experience. reply",

The rough beta is coming at the end of this month for early testers (hit me up at ben@shepherd.com if you want to be on it). It will include the TBR, logging, and search pieces. It won't have website integration yet, but we will keep fixing bugs and adding features. Aiming for a full public launch end of this year, but that is very rough. reply",

          "text": "I’ve been running a job board for remote Human Resources roles since 2019. In 2022 I started generating some revenue by referring traffic to large job aggregators on a cost per click model. I still do everything manually from curating the jobs to daily uploads but it has become a good routine for me. You can see it here: https://www.hrjobsremote.com/ It now grosses around 1,000$ per month on average. Money left after taxes and fixed costs (~650$) I put in a all world index for retirement. Recently I also started a newsletter built on top of Hacker News that curates a weekly roundup of AI links and the discussions around them. I am not sure whether it will be monetized at some point but that is how I started the job board too. It is a side project to keep me occupied during evenings and weekends.

          "text": "I really hope that functional programming and property-based testing [1][2] get taken seriously by real engineers who understand that it is important to know and understand what the program is doing. Something LLMs by their very nature cannot do. I was writing a React application at work based on React Flow[3] and I was mucking about with state management libraries (because that's what the React Flow manual recommends). Maybe it was a skill issue on my part, but I had a hard time with the Zustand library. Then I read up on reducers in React and everything was perfectly clear. A reducer is just a pure function, it takes an existing state and an action and returns the new state. That's simple, I can wrap my brain around that. Plus, I know how to test a pure function, there is nothing to mock, stub or wrap. States and actions are just plain JavaScript objects, there is no history, no side effects, no executable code. And this is where property-based testing comes in: if history does not matter it means I can randomly generate any valid state and any valid action, then apply the reducer function and verify that the resulting state has all the required properties. Only a formal proof would give me more certainty. I fully understand people who want to use LLMs to write tests for them. Writing test cases is boring and tedious. There are many edge cases a human might miss. But relying on a guessing machine and praying it does not write nonsense is just plain irresponsible for someone who calls himself an engineer. People rely on the quality of our software for their work and personal safety. Property-based testing frees us from the tedium and will generate many more tests and we could write by hand, but it does so in a predictable manner that can be fully reasoned about.

          "text": "I agree with the core point: the more pure and deterministic a system is, the easier it is to reason about and test. Reducers + property-based testing push correctness into design, not brittle test cases. One nuance though: property-based testing shines when the domain is already well-modeled. A lot of real QA pain comes where purity breaks down—distributed systems, async flows, partial failures, UI↔backend boundaries. At that point, the hard part isn’t generating tests, it’s reconstructing context. On LLMs: I don’t think they should be trusted as correctness oracles either. Their real value isn’t guessing answers, but helping surface assumptions, generate counter-examples, and expose gaps in our mental model. So the future of QA isn’t humans vs LLMs. It’s better system design + explicit invariants + tools that help engineers doubt their own certainty faster. Most serious bugs come from being sure we understood the system when we didn’t. reply",

Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

I imagine it could even work like Sponsorblock does, and we could crowdsource people who's comments are inflammatory. I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Ironically, I'm irritated with moderation in the other direction: ten years of \"if you keep breaking the guidelines under alternate accounts, we'll ban your real account\" sort of makes my blood boil (people having long-running alts does that too), but I roll with it, because I couldn't do the job better than Dan and Tom do. reply",

For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

This post only has around 100 comments, and even a top page post around 1500. Reddit's front page posts have thousands of comments and for me they seem pretty readable (and we know there are plenty of bots there... but Reddit does use captchas a bit I guess). I guess I am focused on a different problem though of how to attract more good human content... reply",

I did this for a while after being bitten a couple times for not having a credit history. However, I recently stopped. I still keep one card around and active just to maintain my score… just in case. However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network. I would cancel my last credit card, but I don’t want to deal with cell phone deposits and other nonsense, like I had to in the past. reply",

You could implement blocking individual users & etc etc. This app does not have that but it could be forked and modified or talk to the dev...

To complement this, there is near to no long-term accountability for upper leadership for failure, so even as features underperform and strategy turns out to be a flop, they will continue to make millions a year, having layoffs every 6 months, and then acting surprised pikachu when morale is down and top engineers are looking to the door, since salary is barely competitive even if you are a top performer getting special stock awards. reply",

Contractors are being left in limbo more and more often. Half of the people are just talking about layoffs and other are keeping thier mouth shut. There is sense that execs are making one bad decision after another. Xbox division knows this very well, the trust in that division is near zero, but now it has spread to even the orgs which were doing decently well. Product quality is also completely dogshit/dogslop, we have done nothing in last 2 years except making our products worse. We do hear reports of boomer companies moving to Apple every now and then, and these rumours are increasing. Windows 11 is a disaster, Copilot is an convenience no one asked for. Users are contacting support every day asking how to disable all these features but execs keep ignoring users. The consensus among top guys is that customer is wrong and we need to teach them. Trusting stock market more than the customers is now the industry standard. reply",

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team. I have a lot of experience picking up new tech quickly and I'm looking forward to using that in new ways. reply",

The Scientific Place (EdTech): Bootstrapped a platform to 230,000+ organic users. Handled 100% of the stack (Astro/React/FastAPI). 2. Himaya71 (Emergency Response): Architected a sub-100ms indoor pathfinding engine on low-end hardware. Won 20,000 AED in funding from UAEU (3rd Place). 3. AIWAY (Fintech): Built an AI-powered, self-healing crypto trading engine with real-time forecasting, multi-exchange execution, and noise-resistant news signal processing. What I offer: - Total Autonomy: I operate async. I don't need meetings to work; I need a vision to execute. - Speed: I build from 0 to 1 by default. - Stability: Golden Visa holder (UAE), looking for long-term contracts/retainers. reply",

You can also visit github.com/<hnusername>.) I'm not actively looking (hence why my resume link is obfuscated like that) but I'm at least interested in getting a feel for the market right now. That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line! reply",

Email:\nbepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I’m a software engineer with professional experience in backend and full-stack development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at SiriusXM Radio, where I contributed to large-scale production systems. I was affected by a recent layoff and am now actively seeking my next opportunity. My strongest languages are Python, Java, and JavaScript. I’ve worked across multiple environments, including over a year in a classified setting, and I currently hold an active security clearance. I’m seeking a full-time entry- to mid-level software engineering role, ideally focused on backend or full-stack development. I’m open to opportunities across industries and teams and am happy to discuss how my experience could be a fit for your needs. I completed three years of Computer Science and Mathematics coursework at Virginia Tech, including the core CS curriculum (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). I was unable to complete my degree due to financial constraints. At this time, I’m seeking salary-based positions (no equity-only roles). I’m open to conversations, referrals, or advice and would love to connect.\nThank you for your time and consideration. reply",

I make teams easier, often creating fixes for customer/developer pain points (really good at this). Although I've not had the title of \"Lead\" to date, I've filled that role as advisor to peers, user story generator, and representative for requirement meetings with stakeholders. I'm ready to lead a gangbuster team! I view the agreement between stakeholder and developer as one which can be a beautiful moment of pure communication, and that idea leads me to both develop to specifications and define requirements in user stories with precision. A passion and thrill of mine is orchestrating/comprehending complex code bases and noting/implementing fixes and optimizations to them. I strive to develop around the highest impact areas so that the most taxing and critical functions can run without error. I also love maps, rockets, organizing data and BYU sports. GO Cougs! reply",

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

Comfortable with deep debugging, modifying large open-source tunneling codebases, and fully remote, self-directed work. reply",

I’m a designer, coder, prototyper, and creative technologist, or whatever box you wanna throw me in. I generally design and build products end-to-end, from first concept and interface design to working production code. I have multiple years of experience designing and shipping apps, platforms, internal tools, and consumer-facing products. This year (2026) I’m exploring new directions (my own apps), and I would be very happy to spend about 16 hours per week contributing to something interesting, fun and important in the spaces of health, sustainability or community (I know, that's broad). I work fast, think in systems, and care deeply about clarity, quality, and usability. I am, in general, just a nerd who genuinely loves building things that make sense and actually get used.

Even a cloudy sky is actually much much brighter than the lights inside a building, so it has a stronger affect on maintaining your circadian rhythm than indoor lights. It's also a good time to zoom out and reevaluate priorities. Or just enjoy looking at the sky. - Read and revise my todo list. I find I actually spend a huge amount of time thinking about my to do list, and I think it pays off. One better decision of what to work on can save days, lead to new ideas, or even completely change the course of what I work on. - Sometimes I guess I manage to squash a bug or complete some other minor task, but probably I'm more productive if I just use that time to think rather than context switch twice and rush some minor task. - The big exception is if I can get something started that will run on its own for a long time. Then 10 spare minutes can save hours. reply",

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right. When you get back to tasks after spending a few minutes practicing the above, you will feel a distinct sense of greater engagement, focus, energy all in a calm frame of mind and relaxed body. reply",

I am a European who grew up in a country still occupied by Russia. I am increasingly more worried about building my projects on American platforms, using an American operating system, etc.<p>What if the US actually attacks Greenland or finds another way to be openly hostile to Europe? I am not saying it will happen. All I am saying is that it seems prudent to prepare. How would you do it?<p>It is currently impossible to unhook myself from the US, but I would like to minimize exposure.<p>I can’t do anything about things like building an alternative to VISA/MasterCard (except wait for the digital Euro), so I will focus on things I can actually do and ignore things like my government buying F-35s and possibly giving my health data to Palantir.<p>* Mobile phone - there are no real European alternatives; it’s just Apple vs Google. Samsung or HTC with Android seems like a less bad option.<p>* Operating system - I have been using Linux for ages, getting rid of Windows seems relatively easy.<p>* Social networks - I grew to hate them before the current US admin, never used TikTok or Instagram, and I mostly stopped using Facebook and Twitter around the time Musk bought Twitter.<p>* Stripe for payments - this will be hard, but I am experimenting with our local payment processor, and so far it seems surprisingly doable, but it is not a battle-tested solution like Stripe.<p>* Clerk authentication - doable, but a lot of work and worrying<p>* AWS - I had a surprisingly bad experience with AWS and switched to a local provider with a lot less functionality (that I mostly do not need) and a lot better support<p>* GitHub, Cloudflare... dear God, how could we Europeans allow ourselves to be that dependent on anyone? Everything I touch is American.<p>* Gmail - this will be hard (two decades of emails). Any advice?<p>* Anything AI-related - fuuu, I am lost here.<p>What am I missing/forgetting? What do/would you do in my place?<p>I really hope you will take this as a brainstorming exercise and not an attack on America. I really do love the US and hope its democracy turns out to be more resilient than it currently seems.<p>EDIT: Please kindly keep responses practical. Let’s not turn this into a political discussion. You might approach it as a “what if” exercise, even if you think what the current US admin is doing is great, Europeans deserve what they get, etc.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

There's absolutely nothing you can do to any significant degree unless you can get enough people you communicate with to agree to communicate differently. All we need is text, images, and video. No one cares if you use Helvetica or Times New Roman. No significant progress will happen until those high speed undersea cables are sabotaged to blind us from what will happen next. That's when s will start happening and you'll have better options because everyone will be inventing the next best thing like mesh networks and ways to transport large amounts data physically. We're about to go from gigabytes to megabytes of usage, rapidly. Add some power outages and you will have some nice and creative options of communication, storage, and compute. Latency will suck but you'll be able to send a message from Kansas City to North Korea in less than 50 years and there is nothing any can do to stop that. Countries will begin to use nukes to control their population. By the time you \"decouple\" US won't even look the way it does now. We're about to shift borders north through give some lose some diplomacy. Everyone is waiting because no one wants to invest in the south if it's gonna break off anyway and now you have complicated logistics. US itself will begin to be strip mined in under 100 years as intelligent populations depart the continent to make money rebuilding Europe and Russia. reply",

We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction.

Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

Hatchet is an open-source platform for running background jobs at scale. We're hiring engineers who are excited to build the next class of engineering primitives, starting with queues, background tasks and durable execution. We started in early 2024 after launching our distributed task queue ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136 ). Hatchet is currently used by thousands of engineers for all kinds of workloads: log ingestion pipelines, code review agents, video encoding, GPU scheduling, etc. Our target customer is fast-growing startups who have a strong need for background jobs system. These days, that tends to be AI companies, though we're general-purpose and not exclusively targeted for AI workloads.

          "text": "Oh no, haven't gotten reports about the website being slow, thanks for flagging! Which browser are you using? Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

Work: - FastAPI, async Python, Supabase/Postgres - Designing APIs and data models for simulation and optimization workflows - Performance and reliability work across the stack (queries, async, concurrency, resource limits) - Job orchestration for running and tracking simulations - Observability: logging, metrics, tracing, debugging real issues We are especially interested in people who work in a \"vibe engineering\" style: using LLMs and coding agents as accelerators, but still planning ahead, writing tests, supervising agents, and staying fully responsible for code quality and architecture. If you already use AI tools this way in your day-to-day work, you will fit in well here. Stack: FastAPI, Python, Supabase/Postgres, distributed compute for simulations, AI-assisted dev. Benefits: competitive salary, meaningful equity, remote-first, unlimited PTO, 401k match, medical/dental/vision, paid parental leave, home office budget. If this sounds interesting, send a short note to valentin@ionworks.com with \"HN backend\" in the subject and fill in the application here: https://apply.workable.com/ionworks/j/A8C2F4287C/ reply",

Our first product helps human software engineering teams deliver more efficiently and more reliably by assisting in coordination and engineering management. But it’s built on a foundational layer that ingests data, knowledge, and process across communications and systems, exposing that to humans and AI alike. Eventually, Kinelo will become a proper human+AI orchestration layer, managing entire companies, and our goal is to have Kinelo run Kinelo (we already dogfood it today). We’re looking for high ownership individuals to join our small team and shape its direction. We also just opened a new SF office and new hires will have the ability to help shape company culture, engineering practices, architecture, and roadmap. We’re well-funded (just raised another round), founded by a serial founder, anti-bureaucratic, and highly technical. We’re looking for: - Those who want to go 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product - ~8 years professional experience, including the pre-LLM days with strong CS fundamentals - A balance of wisdom from experience and optimism about the future - Strong TypeScript and Postgres (or other RDBMS) experience at scale and with high reliability (SaaS apps, APIs, etc) - Experience with a variety of technologies, including containerization, distributed systems, and at least one strongly typed programming language (Go, C++, Java, etc) - Ideally experience with ML and AI systems (though expertise in ML, data science, etc is not needed for this role) We can’t sponsor visas but relocation assistance to SF is possible.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've seen a few anecdotes lately that say that they use Claude Code on legacy codebase and with relatively little supervision it can work on complex problems. Then the claim that Claude Code writes most of its own code, and that they no longer mentor their newcomers - instead, AI answers their questions and they can start making meaningful changes within the first few days. To me it sounds almost too good to be true, so I'd love to have some reality check.<p>I've spent most of my career in legacy codebases, reading, tracing behavior, making careful changes, and writing tests to protect them. I've taken a sabbatical though, which ends soon, and I'm quite worried and excited to what has happened during this time.<p>For those working on legacy codebases:<p>- Has the workflow really shifted to prompting AI, reviewing output, and maintaining .md instructions?<p>- Does your company allow Claude Code, Codex or similar tools? If not, what do you use?<p>- Do companies worry about costs and code privacy?<p>- Where do you think this is headed, a year from now?<p>Concrete examples, good or bad, would be especially helpful.

          "text": "I work mostly in Ansible and Copilot is completely incompetent when trying to deal with it. I’ve tried several models that are available (Claude, Gemini, various GPTs, Codex), and they’ve all been pretty bad. For example, I asked just this week if a when condition on a block was evaluated once for the block or applied to each task. I thought it was each task, but wanted to double check. It told me it was done once for the block, which was not what I was expecting. I setup a test and ran it; it was wrong. It evaluates the condition on every task in the block. This seems like a basic thing and it was completely wrong. This happens every time I try to use it. I have no idea how people are trusting it to write 80% of their code. We recently got access to agent mode, which is the default now. Every time it has tried to do anything it destroys my code. When asking it to insert a single task, it doesn’t understand how to format yaml/ansible, and I always have to fix it after it’s done. I can’t relate to anything people are saying about AI when it comes to my job. If the AI was a co-worker, I wouldn’t trust them with anything, and would pray they were cut in the next round of layoffs. It’s constantly wrong, but really confident about it. It apologizes, but never actually corrects its behavior to improve. It’s like working with a psychopath. In terms of training AI on our code base, that seems unlikely. We’re not even allowed to give our entire team (of less than 10 people) access to our code. We also can’t use whatever AI tool is out there. We can only use Copilot and the models it has, and only through our work account with SSO so it applies various privacy rules (from my limited understanding). We don’t yet have access to a general purpose AI at work, but they are in pilot I think. I have no idea where it’s heading, as I have trouble squaring the reality of my experience with the anecdotes I read online, to the point where I question if any of it is real, or these are all investors trying to keep the stock prices going up. Maybe if I was working in a more traditional language or a greenfield environment that started with AI… maybe it would be better. Right now, I’m not impressed at all. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi HN,<p>We are working on a document vault designed for people and organizations who cannot accept cloud exposure.<p>The system is intentionally boring in some ways:\n • No required accounts\n • No cloud dependency for core functionality\n • Fully offline operation\n • Local encryption\n • Air-gapped storage\n • Encrypted export and controlled, encrypted printing<p>The printing piece is why we started this. In many environments, printing is still unavoidable, and it remains one of the largest data-leak vectors. Most privacy tools stop at storage and ignore output entirely.<p>This is not meant to replace cloud storage for everyone. It is for cases where the threat model assumes:\n • Networks are hostile\n • Cloud accounts will eventually be compromised\n • Convenience must sometimes be traded for control<p>We are explicitly not claiming:\n • “Unhackable”\n • “Military-grade”\n • “Zero risk”<p>We are trying to minimize attack surface and failure modes, not eliminate them.<p>We would genuinely value feedback on:\n • Threat model blind spots\n • Encrypted printing assumptions\n • Physical access risks\n • Update and key management strategies\n • What would make you immediately distrust this<p>If this sounds like something you would never use, that is also useful feedback.<p>Thanks.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

          "text": "I think some of the best engineering leveling up one can do is to become an expert in other domains completely unrelated to what you’re working on now. Furthermore, build more and read less. Programming books, while a great resource, are detached from the everyday realities for software engineering. The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage. Simply knowing a few programming languages is not enough, in fact it should barely even matter once you’ve hit a certain level of experience. reply",

For ok results we are looking at 12-14GB of vram committed to models to make this happen. My MacBook with 24GB of total ram runs fine with a 14B model running but I don't think most people have quite enough ram yet. Still I think it's something we are going to need. We are also going to want the opposite. A way for an LLM to request tool calls so that it can drive an arbitrary application. MCP exists, but it expects you to preregister all your MCP servers. I am not sure how well preregistering would work at the scale of every application on your PC. reply",

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs. Example: You need to learn a new language/framework and maybe spend some extra hours outside of work for a few weeks to ramp up for a new project. But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule.

They'd set a new state of the art for what an enthusiast could run on their laptop or home server.<p>Meta, Deepseek, Mistral, Qwen, even Google etc. were publishing new models left and right. There were new formats, quantizations, inference engines etc. and most importantly - a lot of discourse and excitement around them.<p>Quietly and suddenly, this changed. After the release of gpt-oss (August 2025), the discourse has been heavily dominated around hosted models now. I don't think I've seen any mention of Ollama in any discussion that reached HN's front page in the last 6 months.<p>What gives? Is this a proxy signal that we've hit a barrier in LLM efficiency?</p></p></p></p></div>",

I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

Nothing against the people in particular, but sometimes when I see a handle (like others said, very often old accounts with high karma), I already know what they will go on about merely just based off the title of the submission and having unintentionally gleaned what topics they usually comment on just by being on HN for a while. It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though. That threshold is a bit higher, I did it for blocking certain domains; there is only so many times I can sit through an article or an \"essay\" which should have been a podcast. reply",

I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

I was suggesting that login / auth takes place by credit score verification. This would solve a couple problems. First, and most important, we know it's a real person commenting / participating. Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online. Anyways, from the little research I've done, it's certainly illegal and not a proper mechanism for authentication. One can dream though :) reply",

I did this for a while after being bitten a couple times for not having a credit history. However, I recently stopped. I still keep one card around and active just to maintain my score… just in case. However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network. I would cancel my last credit card, but I don’t want to deal with cell phone deposits and other nonsense, like I had to in the past. reply",

Contractors are being left in limbo more and more often. Half of the people are just talking about layoffs and other are keeping thier mouth shut. There is sense that execs are making one bad decision after another. Xbox division knows this very well, the trust in that division is near zero, but now it has spread to even the orgs which were doing decently well. Product quality is also completely dogshit/dogslop, we have done nothing in last 2 years except making our products worse. We do hear reports of boomer companies moving to Apple every now and then, and these rumours are increasing. Windows 11 is a disaster, Copilot is an convenience no one asked for. Users are contacting support every day asking how to disable all these features but execs keep ignoring users. The consensus among top guys is that customer is wrong and we need to teach them. Trusting stock market more than the customers is now the industry standard. reply",

The dude was about the retire, was fed up, and knew exactly what was wrong. He claimed to have a fix pending approval that had been held up by his chain. We ended up getting a hot fix after a lot of drama with account leadership. I was grateful to the guy, but kind of shocked that morale in that group was so bad.

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team. I have a lot of experience picking up new tech quickly and I'm looking forward to using that in new ways. reply",

I’m a hybrid profile somewhere between a software engineer, a scientist, and an entrepreneur. I’ve worked at CERN, in startups and scaleups, and at international research centres. I’ve also co-founded a startup and participated in Entrepreneurs First. I’ve led teams and owned technical and product roadmaps end to end.

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers.

I completed three years of Computer Science and Mathematics coursework at Virginia Tech, including the core CS curriculum (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). I was unable to complete my degree due to financial constraints. At this time, I’m seeking salary-based positions (no equity-only roles). I’m open to conversations, referrals, or advice and would love to connect.\nThank you for your time and consideration. reply",

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

Those things. Website / Portfolio: https://www.marcia.no + https://www.middot.nl Email: hn@marcianoplanque.nl About: Hey, I’m Marciano. I’m a designer, coder, prototyper, and creative technologist, or whatever box you wanna throw me in. I generally design and build products end-to-end, from first concept and interface design to working production code. I have multiple years of experience designing and shipping apps, platforms, internal tools, and consumer-facing products. This year (2026) I’m exploring new directions (my own apps), and I would be very happy to spend about 16 hours per week contributing to something interesting, fun and important in the spaces of health, sustainability or community (I know, that's broad). I work fast, think in systems, and care deeply about clarity, quality, and usability. I am, in general, just a nerd who genuinely loves building things that make sense and actually get used.

Maybe you just need to find the right application to create. It's kind of hard these days, because if you look at the world of software, corporations have enterprise systems that don't really spark any excitement for the people working on them, video games are worse than what they used to be, specifically AAA titles (indie games are cool, but they don't bring me as much excitement as AAA titles), there's like a million Android and iOS apps, most of which just aren't as... amazing as you'd want them to be. If you really think about it, it just really comes down to the money. See, the United States is $38 trillion in debt, and as a result, I think a lot of people are struggling. If the U.S. wasn't $38 trillion in debt, I think a lot of people would have a lot more fun with software, in a way that... there would be something to create. So, what I'm saying is, if there's a way to create software that revives society, and eases the struggle with money, that would be the thing to create. reply",

I am wary of hanging over the reigns entirely to AI, not just on a one-off project basis, but long-term. I don't think it's wise to rely so heavily on proprietary cloud-based applications as software development tools. Keeping one's hand on the wheel enough -- maybe like as that article describes -- should hopefully leave one still able to take over control entirely if needed. Of course, who's to say what your employer might demand? It sounds like some people are insistent upon producing code at maximum possible speed, such that if you are still even reviewing code, much less writing some of it by hand, you are wasting time.

To me, that solution would be simple... cut out the slop, make stuff that you'll be remembered for, that you and maybe some like-minded folks collaborate on. Who cares what some rando vibeclown thinks how long something takes? You did something you might be proud of (i. e. you didn't waste time on trivialities like so many others) and had fun along the way. But then again my advice comes from a different corner. I don't do vibecoding. Never have, never will. I also count myself lucky that I never had to as all my professional creative endeavours happen(ed) in a freelance capacity, thereby circumventing the corporate slopmire. And I'll intend to keep it that way for control, time, and my mental health are much more important to me.

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right. When you get back to tasks after spending a few minutes practicing the above, you will feel a distinct sense of greater engagement, focus, energy all in a calm frame of mind and relaxed body. reply",

We’ve raised a $31m Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Initialized Capital, Y Combinator, Felicis Ventures, Altos Ventures, and the founders and executives from Zillow, PlanGrid, Thumbtack, Bluebeam, Uber, Procore, and more.

          "text": "MiLaboratories | Bilbao, Spain | ONSITE | VISA SPONSORSHIP | RELOCATION SUPPORT We are MiLaboratories, the team behind Platforma.bio & MiXCR. We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team.

Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

          "text": "Oh no, haven't gotten reports about the website being slow, thanks for flagging! Which browser are you using? Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

They're dealing with messy reality: PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, APIs scattered across systems. We let non-technical teams build production-grade automation by describing what they need in plain English. Senior SRE: Join our platform team keeping the foundation solid as we scale. Own reliability, security, and developer experience for a multi-tenant system handling 100+ integrations. You'll be on-call, but working on genuinely interesting problems: making deploys boring, keeping customer workflows running, building infrastructure that compounds. Best fit if you care about enabling teams, not just managing pipes. Senior Full Stack Product Engineer: Own entire features from idea to production. Build interfaces that make complex automation accessible to people who've never written code. Current problems: LLM-powered workflow generation, extracting structure from chaos (PDFs, emails, weird APIs), real-time collaboration on live data pipelines.\nThe companies winning with AI in 2026 are the ones who made their business logic explicit and their context connected.

We’re looking for paid consulting or advisory conversations to sanity-check an MVP approach before we pitch a pilot to talent agencies or studios.\nIf you’ve worked on fingerprinting systems (music, video, speech, ML training detection, etc.) and are open to a conversation, I’d love to hear from you feel free to email me @ dmschultz1964@gmail.com \nThanks in advance. reply",

As our customers evolved, so did we. Today, more than 2,000 companies use our technology to power real-time analytics, agentic applications, and high-ingest operational systems. What started as a time-series database has become the fastest PostgreSQL for modern workloads. To reflect that evolution, we’re now TigerData—a name that speaks to our speed, precision, and ambition. The tiger has long been part of our culture: fast, focused, powerful. From “Tiger Time” all-hands to welcoming new hires as “tiger cubs,” it’s how we build—decisively, fearlessly, and with purpose. This is not a reinvention: it’s a reflection of how we already serve our customers today. TigerData is growing!

You have to cut out the middlemen who are skimming the economy for little to no value. You can move up to $10M in value in the US on FedNow instant payment rails for a few pennies, instantly (~20 second SLA 24/7/365), for example [1]. Now, with regards to your specific inquiry, your unsophisticated consumer probably cares more about points and cash back. How do you disincentivize that? As a merchant, you offer free instant payment options and surcharge the customer to use more expensive payment rails (credit cards, for example). At least in the US, we're on our way in that regard (Walmart is offering pay by bank using instant payment rails to avoid billions in interchange costs [2]). You might find this latest CFPB report helpful [3], as well as this McKinsey report on payments [4] for further reading. I'd also recommend the Fintech Takes mailing list [5].

I am a European who grew up in a country still occupied by Russia. I am increasingly more worried about building my projects on American platforms, using an American operating system, etc.<p>What if the US actually attacks Greenland or finds another way to be openly hostile to Europe? I am not saying it will happen. All I am saying is that it seems prudent to prepare. How would you do it?<p>It is currently impossible to unhook myself from the US, but I would like to minimize exposure.<p>I can’t do anything about things like building an alternative to VISA/MasterCard (except wait for the digital Euro), so I will focus on things I can actually do and ignore things like my government buying F-35s and possibly giving my health data to Palantir.<p>* Mobile phone - there are no real European alternatives; it’s just Apple vs Google. Samsung or HTC with Android seems like a less bad option.<p>* Operating system - I have been using Linux for ages, getting rid of Windows seems relatively easy.<p>* Social networks - I grew to hate them before the current US admin, never used TikTok or Instagram, and I mostly stopped using Facebook and Twitter around the time Musk bought Twitter.<p>* Stripe for payments - this will be hard, but I am experimenting with our local payment processor, and so far it seems surprisingly doable, but it is not a battle-tested solution like Stripe.<p>* Clerk authentication - doable, but a lot of work and worrying<p>* AWS - I had a surprisingly bad experience with AWS and switched to a local provider with a lot less functionality (that I mostly do not need) and a lot better support<p>* GitHub, Cloudflare... dear God, how could we Europeans allow ourselves to be that dependent on anyone? Everything I touch is American.<p>* Gmail - this will be hard (two decades of emails). Any advice?<p>* Anything AI-related - fuuu, I am lost here.<p>What am I missing/forgetting? What do/would you do in my place?<p>I really hope you will take this as a brainstorming exercise and not an attack on America. I really do love the US and hope its democracy turns out to be more resilient than it currently seems.<p>EDIT: Please kindly keep responses practical. Let’s not turn this into a political discussion. You might approach it as a “what if” exercise, even if you think what the current US admin is doing is great, Europeans deserve what they get, etc.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

There's absolutely nothing you can do to any significant degree unless you can get enough people you communicate with to agree to communicate differently. All we need is text, images, and video. No one cares if you use Helvetica or Times New Roman. No significant progress will happen until those high speed undersea cables are sabotaged to blind us from what will happen next. That's when s will start happening and you'll have better options because everyone will be inventing the next best thing like mesh networks and ways to transport large amounts data physically. We're about to go from gigabytes to megabytes of usage, rapidly. Add some power outages and you will have some nice and creative options of communication, storage, and compute. Latency will suck but you'll be able to send a message from Kansas City to North Korea in less than 50 years and there is nothing any can do to stop that. Countries will begin to use nukes to control their population. By the time you \"decouple\" US won't even look the way it does now. We're about to shift borders north through give some lose some diplomacy. Everyone is waiting because no one wants to invest in the south if it's gonna break off anyway and now you have complicated logistics. US itself will begin to be strip mined in under 100 years as intelligent populations depart the continent to make money rebuilding Europe and Russia. reply",

If you’re ok with that, go for it! Check out ROS.  No, it’s not what they use, but it’s free and available and absolutely gives you a good idea of the kinds of workflows you will see.  When I worked in the industry, all physical hardware was plugged into massive simulation setups and run over and over and over again.  Multiple hardware revisions, multiple software revisions.  All before they would try putting it into an actual prototype vehicle.  ROS lets you do all that - simulations plus interfacing with actual robotic equipment. Good luck reply",

Then there's a cron job that compresses, encrypts, and tries to send the logs to device specific S3 buckets. If the on device logs get too big they start dropping old logs first, with a heuristic for certain logs being more/less important. When devices reconnect to the cloud they start pushing logs as quickly as they can, the cloud infra backfills metrics as they arrive. Once in S3, triggers start a series of lambdas to decrypt, decompress, analysis. Works well, easy to reason about. The backend can easily be swapped out for something else. The harder part is the log compress/encrypt/rotate. It's important that you don't treat all logs exactly the same. Some are much more important and should be preserved over others. reply",

          "text": "This is gold, thank you. The “easy to reason about” part is exactly what I’m going for. A couple quick questions if you don’t mind: Roughly what volume are you pushing per device (MB/day or events/sec), and what’s your typical offline window? What’s your biggest failure mode today: disk-full/rotate policy, encryption key handling, replay storms on reconnect, or Lambda fanout/cost? I’m thinking Ayder could replace the “rotate → ship” backend with a durable local log + priority queues + replay, but you’re right that the hardest part is the policy (what to drop first, how to bound disk, and how to preserve critical streams). If you’re open, I’d love to learn what heuristics you ended up with. reply",

Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product.

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

          "text": "\"10 parallel agents\" was just one guy with access to unlimited credits. Most of us are on Max plan or API plan, and cant afford to burn credits. He can just run the agents just to show that he is running 10 parallel agents. As an avg dev, what I can even do with 10 agents? It like managing 10 toddlers who can code, it looks good but it becomes hard to manage as you have limited context in your brain. 2 is the best setup if you can afford. One can write Tests and other can write the code. This is better because if you just use the same agent instance, its not gonna be able to write good tests as it will just write tests that its code is gonna pass. Its different for everyone else, but for me, 2 is the best setup for TDD. Apart from that, you can just go ahead and do it your own way. I have found that many senior engineers think they are special when they can make Claude Code do something, they think its with their setup but I am usually able to replicate without any setups or Agents.md/Claude.md, the models are good enough without any complex setup. reply",

I always review/edit regardless. Much faster than writing from scratch, and combining responses on the same topic is sometimes best. Copilot for code completion + reviews or small snippets/functions but larger code/module generation has been weak so far. Claude for full modules generation or complex multi-file edits. Research: Grok (less filtered + better search), Claude (complex dev topics), GPT (balanced but sometimes slanted and/or seems to favor certain sources). My Teams: Mostly Copilot for code completion/reviews, mix of GPT/Claude for code. Last year was loose/experimental to learn but we plan to formalize guidelines more this quarter. Definitely a ton of hype that doesn't always match reality, but it is a super powerful tool that really has made things move faster. reply",

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs.

But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule.

At the time according to my resume, I had 10 years of experience (many more years of experience.  But not one cares about my programming in C on mainframes in the 90s) including 2 leading AWS architecture at a startup and 3.5 working directly at AWS (full time consulting division). After being Amazoned for shits and giggles I randomly applied for hundreds of jobs that I was qualified for - I heard crickets.  I never do this and I didn’t expect much to come from it. I did her multiple offers in a couple of weeks via my network and targeted outreach to recruiters where I was an industry expert in a niche of AWS that’s popular.  But not many people have experience with. On another note, the mid size company I work for sent around 300 offers last year and we had an offer/application rate of 0.4%. Every opening  for any remote job gets literally hundreds of applications within 24 hours.  It’s almost impossible to stand out from the crowd. reply",

For the last year or so all orders from leadership have been \"build more AI, show AI usage\" even above things like stability and reliability. There was no recognition from leadership over what use cases worked or not, and they appeared to believe their own hype. To complement this, there is near to no long-term accountability for upper leadership for failure, so even as features underperform and strategy turns out to be a flop, they will continue to make millions a year, having layoffs every 6 months, and then acting surprised pikachu when morale is down and top engineers are looking to the door, since salary is barely competitive even if you are a top performer getting special stock awards. reply",

I had to update from Win 7 to 10 for the desktop I built for him, and that was a big struggle for him. That would probably be many times harder now considering the sad shape of Windows.

There is sense that execs are making one bad decision after another. Xbox division knows this very well, the trust in that division is near zero, but now it has spread to even the orgs which were doing decently well. Product quality is also completely dogshit/dogslop, we have done nothing in last 2 years except making our products worse. We do hear reports of boomer companies moving to Apple every now and then, and these rumours are increasing. Windows 11 is a disaster, Copilot is an convenience no one asked for. Users are contacting support every day asking how to disable all these features but execs keep ignoring users. The consensus among top guys is that customer is wrong and we need to teach them.

We had a service impacting issue and went through the typical Premier/Unified support gaslighting exercise. We finally escalated it to a batshit level and got to a real engineer. The dude was about the retire, was fed up, and knew exactly what was wrong. He claimed to have a fix pending approval that had been held up by his chain. We ended up getting a hot fix after a lot of drama with account leadership. I was grateful to the guy, but kind of shocked that morale in that group was so bad. I used to be acquainted with a few people there over the years and every single one of them was either laid off or left. I never heard of anything like that at Microsoft at all, especially as a customer. reply",

Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

I imagine it could even work like Sponsorblock does, and we could crowdsource people who's comments are inflammatory. I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't think a captcha is the solution, as it'll degrade conversation by an OOM though. reply",

I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

I was suggesting that login / auth takes place by credit score verification. This would solve a couple problems. First, and most important, we know it's a real person commenting / participating. Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online. Anyways, from the little research I've done, it's certainly illegal and not a proper mechanism for authentication. One can dream though :) reply",

I did this for a while after being bitten a couple times for not having a credit history. However, I recently stopped. I still keep one card around and active just to maintain my score… just in case. However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network. I would cancel my last credit card, but I don’t want to deal with cell phone deposits and other nonsense, like I had to in the past. reply",

          "text": "Every developer should learn the basics of Servers, Linux, VPS hosting etc. It is not that hard especially with the amount of information that's online. You mentioned Golang. For those languages, it is even easier because you literally host a single binary on the VPS. So go ahead, learn it. The naysayers will scare you into thinking that you need someone else to do it for you but you usually don't. Not unless you are running an app with mission critical requirements and at scale.It is totally ok to host your own app on a VPS that gets a few hundred requests in a day or even more. My suggestions: 1. Start with a specific OS on a linux box. Ubuntu is a standard one that you can just start with. 2. Install your application first without docker. If binary (e.g. Golang), you can literally copy the binary (make sure you build it for your OS on the server) and then run it either using something ike supervisor/systemd 3. Then, use a reverse proxy like Caddy in front of it for SSL and actual domain. 4. Get a custom domain from any provider and set the DNS for that domain to point to the IP address of this server. 5. If you want to get real fancy, instead of pointing d0main directly to the IP of the server, get a DNS with cloudflare and point there. Then configure cloudflare to point to the actual server (a.k.a origin server) This way, you get additional benefits like WAF, DDOS protection etc. Even cloudflare free plan offers this with some limits. Then repeat the process in 2,3 but with docker container. You can do all of this easily in ChatGPT etc nowadays by asking: - I want to install a Go App on an Ubuntu VPS using systemd/supervisor and put Caddy as reverse proxy in front. Then I will want to use a custom domain where DNS is hoted with Cloudflare which ultimately points to Caddy. It is not that hard. Not to learn at least. reply",

Reading and using a simple dockerfile is also dead simple. Understanding compose and port and volume mapping is a bit trickier but not daunting. Once you have the basics of understanding a dockerfile you can switch to doing container based development in vscode and you will never go back to writing code on your host again. Vscode is not the only ide that supports this, just the one I use most of the time. There are also docker alternatives like rancher and postman but I still use docker when doing dec work. Good luck.

They'd set a new state of the art for what an enthusiast could run on their laptop or home server.<p>Meta, Deepseek, Mistral, Qwen, even Google etc. were publishing new models left and right. There were new formats, quantizations, inference engines etc. and most importantly - a lot of discourse and excitement around them.<p>Quietly and suddenly, this changed. After the release of gpt-oss (August 2025), the discourse has been heavily dominated around hosted models now. I don't think I've seen any mention of Ollama in any discussion that reached HN's front page in the last 6 months.<p>What gives? Is this a proxy signal that we've hit a barrier in LLM efficiency?</p></p></p></p></div>",

I am a European who grew up in a country still occupied by Russia. I am increasingly more worried about building my projects on American platforms, using an American operating system, etc.<p>What if the US actually attacks Greenland or finds another way to be openly hostile to Europe? I am not saying it will happen. All I am saying is that it seems prudent to prepare. How would you do it?<p>It is currently impossible to unhook myself from the US, but I would like to minimize exposure.<p>I can’t do anything about things like building an alternative to VISA/MasterCard (except wait for the digital Euro), so I will focus on things I can actually do and ignore things like my government buying F-35s and possibly giving my health data to Palantir.<p>* Mobile phone - there are no real European alternatives; it’s just Apple vs Google. Samsung or HTC with Android seems like a less bad option.<p>* Operating system - I have been using Linux for ages, getting rid of Windows seems relatively easy.<p>* Social networks - I grew to hate them before the current US admin, never used TikTok or Instagram, and I mostly stopped using Facebook and Twitter around the time Musk bought Twitter.<p>* Stripe for payments - this will be hard, but I am experimenting with our local payment processor, and so far it seems surprisingly doable, but it is not a battle-tested solution like Stripe.<p>* Clerk authentication - doable, but a lot of work and worrying<p>* AWS - I had a surprisingly bad experience with AWS and switched to a local provider with a lot less functionality (that I mostly do not need) and a lot better support<p>* GitHub, Cloudflare... dear God, how could we Europeans allow ourselves to be that dependent on anyone? Everything I touch is American.<p>* Gmail - this will be hard (two decades of emails). Any advice?<p>* Anything AI-related - fuuu, I am lost here.<p>What am I missing/forgetting? What do/would you do in my place?<p>I really hope you will take this as a brainstorming exercise and not an attack on America. I really do love the US and hope its democracy turns out to be more resilient than it currently seems.<p>EDIT: Please kindly keep responses practical. Let’s not turn this into a political discussion. You might approach it as a “what if” exercise, even if you think what the current US admin is doing is great, Europeans deserve what they get, etc.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

There's absolutely nothing you can do to any significant degree unless you can get enough people you communicate with to agree to communicate differently. All we need is text, images, and video. No one cares if you use Helvetica or Times New Roman. No significant progress will happen until those high speed undersea cables are sabotaged to blind us from what will happen next. That's when s will start happening and you'll have better options because everyone will be inventing the next best thing like mesh networks and ways to transport large amounts data physically. We're about to go from gigabytes to megabytes of usage, rapidly. Add some power outages and you will have some nice and creative options of communication, storage, and compute. Latency will suck but you'll be able to send a message from Kansas City to North Korea in less than 50 years and there is nothing any can do to stop that. Countries will begin to use nukes to control their population. By the time you \"decouple\" US won't even look the way it does now. We're about to shift borders north through give some lose some diplomacy. Everyone is waiting because no one wants to invest in the south if it's gonna break off anyway and now you have complicated logistics.

Then there's a cron job that compresses, encrypts, and tries to send the logs to device specific S3 buckets. If the on device logs get too big they start dropping old logs first, with a heuristic for certain logs being more/less important. When devices reconnect to the cloud they start pushing logs as quickly as they can, the cloud infra backfills metrics as they arrive. Once in S3, triggers start a series of lambdas to decrypt, decompress, analysis. Works well, easy to reason about. The backend can easily be swapped out for something else. The harder part is the log compress/encrypt/rotate. It's important that you don't treat all logs exactly the same. Some are much more important and should be preserved over others. reply",

What’s your biggest failure mode today: disk-full/rotate policy, encryption key handling, replay storms on reconnect, or Lambda fanout/cost? I’m thinking Ayder could replace the “rotate → ship” backend with a durable local log + priority queues + replay, but you’re right that the hardest part is the policy (what to drop first, how to bound disk, and how to preserve critical streams).

          "text": "I thought that this article submission a few days ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46543516 presented a reasonable approach for using AI coding tools but still staying engaged with the code. I am wary of hanging over the reigns entirely to AI, not just on a one-off project basis, but long-term. I don't think it's wise to rely so heavily on proprietary cloud-based applications as software development tools. Keeping one's hand on the wheel enough -- maybe like as that article describes -- should hopefully leave one still able to take over control entirely if needed. Of course, who's to say what your employer might demand? It sounds like some people are insistent upon producing code at maximum possible speed, such that if you are still even reviewing code, much less writing some of it by hand, you are wasting time. I don't care for or agree with that notion, but it's not my place to tell someone else what to do. reply",

          "text": "> \"Am I overthinking it?\" It feels like you answered your own questions and are also to bothered by what sloperators and assorted clout chasers think. Coding, especially \"deep work\", is your passion that you'll still do once you exit the rat race, vibe coding is the source of your intellectual understimulation. To me, that solution would be simple... cut out the slop, make stuff that you'll be remembered for, that you and maybe some like-minded folks collaborate on. Who cares what some rando vibeclown thinks how long something takes? You did something you might be proud of (i. e. you didn't waste time on trivialities like so many others) and had fun along the way. But then again my advice comes from a different corner. I don't do vibecoding. Never have, never will. I also count myself lucky that I never had to as all my professional creative endeavours happen(ed) in a freelance capacity, thereby circumventing the corporate slopmire. And I'll intend to keep it that way for control, time, and my mental health are much more important to me. I also enjoy the privilege that I don't have to live in the United States, or a country with a similar, or even worse, setup... As for different industries... that depends on a lot factors. reply",

I self-taught my way into dev and finished a CS degree while working.<p>I’m currently at a {big_slow_corp} and feeling the AI squeeze trying to switch jobs. My exp is not public facing so the “experience building scalable apps to disrupt the market” requirement I think is my weakness. I’ve also realized my heart isn’t in web frameworks. I’m the guy bored on a plane talking to his gf about flap software, throttle response, and suspension geometry like a kid showing a toy to his mom.<p>I want to move \"closer to the metal\", ECUs, controlling machinery, I’d love ML applied to machinery, even infotainments!, but my professional resume is strictly high-level. My tinkering experience includes building MegaSquirts and using ESP32s for signal filtering and logic, data loggers and wiring things you’d find in a race car, but I currently lack a project car to demonstrate new work.<p>How can I bridge the gap from Java/Angular to automotive software?<p>Does a decade of IT and 4 in backend experience carry weight in the \"Software Defined Vehicle\" world, or am I starting at zero?<p>What \"proof of work\" can I build to wow recruiters at places like Toyota Research or Tesla (any brand with US presence really) without a physical car to hack on?<p>I'm ready to pivot to where my passion actually is.

Because it is a vast vast market with very diverse bespoke problems, there is a huge potential for small \"bicycle-size\" [1] improvements. Sure it is not lead software engineer for Ferrari. But because people hire people they know, doing is your best route for meeting people. And when people hire engineers, they also consider their engineering wherewithal. Finally, if hacking automotive solutions does not appeal to you, that may be a sign that current job escape is more motivating than the specific career switch.

If you break in, you’ll probably need to move to a less glamorous area and accept lower pay.  And you’ll always be lower than people with engineering degrees in the corporate prestige hierarchy.  If you’re ok with that, go for it! Check out ROS.  No, it’s not what they use, but it’s free and available and absolutely gives you a good idea of the kinds of workflows you will see.  When I worked in the industry, all physical hardware was plugged into massive simulation setups and run over and over and over again.  Multiple hardware revisions, multiple software revisions.  All before they would try putting it into an actual prototype vehicle.  ROS lets you do all that - simulations plus interfacing with actual robotic equipment. Good luck reply",
