I enjoy building dynamic, high-performance applications—ranging from responsive UIs with React to real-time backend systems that scale. Most recently, I created Willow, an open-source framework for building Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines. It leverages Kafka, Debezium, and PostgreSQL to process database changes in real time. You can check it out here: https://willow-cdc.github.io/ . What I bring to the table: - React & Frontend Expertise: Built component-driven UIs with React, TypeScript, and Material UI\n- Backend & Data Processing: Designed scalable APIs, database workflows, and event-driven systems\n- Distributed Systems & Real-Time Data: Worked with Kafka, WebSockets, Redis, and CDC pipelines\n- DevOps Awareness: Experience with Docker, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and performance tuning I'm looking for remote opportunities where I can work on scalable web apps, high-performance APIs, and data-driven workflows.

I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me.

Résumé/CV: Available by request Email: rtlo9962@gmail.com I'm a software engineer with a background in law and business (JD/MBA), now focused on hands-on engineering for cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, and AI-powered applications. I enjoy architecting reliable systems and have experience with backend development and open-source contributions. Most recently, I contributed to Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI agents and workflows. I focused heavily on integrations and reliability: I built the PostHog observability exporter to bridge OpenTelemetry spans with AI analytics, implemented the Azure OpenAI provider with OAuth2 token caching, and resolved critical state propagation issues within Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. Working on a Datadog Observability exporter currently. I also created Nimbus ( https://nimbusnlp.github.io/ ), an open-source framework that simplifies deploying lightweight NLP models to AWS. It utilizes a TypeScript CLI and AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of serverless infrastructure (Lambda via Docker), reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Previously, I contributed to Mozilla Firefox, enabling extension developers to manually trigger update checks to accelerate the delivery of security patches, alongside safeguards to prevent keyboard shortcut conflicts. I also have experience building AI agents and RAG-based applications. I am looking for remote or hybrid work in NYC or CT. reply",

I make teams easier, often creating fixes for customer/developer pain points (really good at this). Although I've not had the title of \"Lead\" to date, I've filled that role as advisor to peers, user story generator, and representative for requirement meetings with stakeholders. I'm ready to lead a gangbuster team!

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers.

          "text": "Location: Remote, Canada Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS Interests : systems programming, compilers, 2D & 3D graphics, performance -------- Hello, my name is Jesse. I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before. I've worked at every level of the stack, from cycle-shaving hot loops that saturate instruction pipelines to the frontend of large web applications. My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler, a cycle simulator and visual debugger. In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack. I'm comfortable working in heavily multithreaded/async soft-realtime environments where performance is a key acceptance criteria. I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines. I have working knowledge of interpreters, dynamic language runtimes and garbage collectors. I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to. In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly. I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external. I have a track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better. In my personal life, I enjoy travelling, surfing, climbing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, pirates, and attending raves. I like the phrase \"have strong opinions, weakly held\". If I was born to do one thing in this world, it's program computers.

Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so. My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller. I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role. ( https://cadocary.com ) Earlier in my career, I worked in electronics and hardware, including DO-160 compliant aircraft electronics testing, circuit design, and electrical bench tools.  More recently it’s fullstack webapps and AI wrappers, including training and deploying own models, specifically supervised classification.  My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO. A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University. I taught nearly all core CS degree courses, authored four original courses that were added to the official catalog, and earned the highest student evaluation scores in the department across all quantitative metrics.  \nStudent evaluations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zb9vbd4TYhYxqA_o_aZVg7-nIWm... reply",

I have 15 years of web experience building CMS and CRM for small and large companies. As a co-founder (as well as my prior years), I wore many hats and spent countless hours as a result I can architect and design large codebases, hire and retain talent, lead and manage teams and set company-wide goals. I built and managed an engineering team located all around the globe and built a platform empowering small and medium businesses to run their operations; the company is entering a new phase of growth and it is the right time for me to find opportunities that aligns with my personal goals. I am looking for a role at an established company. The bigger the problem, the more exciting. A perfect role for my profile may be one that blends my experience of building a successful B2B2C startup (building teams, product and software) and my experience of building B2B tools at a large company (Twitter). If you need someone that can be an immediate value-add, bringing a ton of firepower, solving big problems and rallying teams to move mountains: hit me up! reply",

I have worked as a full-stack engineer for the past five years where I have built consumer-facing features, lead teams, and helped shape the tech culture of a small startup. Apart from my experience in full-stack web development, I am also interested in AI and databases. I have made some recent contributions to LangChain and LangGraph. I would be more than happy to work anywhere in the stack and in any domain. Looking for roles with high ownership, strong engineering culture, and meaningful technical depth. reply",

We are building the \"OS for Biology\"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the \"Special Impatriate Regime\" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a \"nice to have.\" Relocation: Comprehensive \"Soft Landing\" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team.

          "text": "Technically, no—and that’s actually a huge plus. The 'Beckham Law' (24% flat rate) applies to the rest of Spain. Bizkaia has fiscal autonomy and a different system to attract talent: you get a 30% exemption on gross income plus you can deduct specific expenses (like your apartment rent, school fees, etc.) from the taxable base. The total tax exemption can reach up to 50% of your gross income. This stacking effect (exemption + expense deductions) is why the effective rate here often drops well below the national 24%. For example, on a €100k salary, your effective tax rate typically lands between 15-20% (depending on your rent and family status). reply",

          "text": "Oh no, haven't gotten reports about the website being slow, thanks for flagging! Which browser are you using? Regarding Temporal, our goal is to create the best developer experience possible, and we started Hatchet because we felt that Temporal misses the mark (I used Temporal for years before starting Hatchet). The primary difference is that we're not solely focused on durable workflows, we're a general-purpose background jobs platform which offers durable workflows as a feature. In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows. Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution We've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal. But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally. reply",

          "text": "Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only) American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

You will craft performant, stable frontends that explain technical concepts to non-technical users and help us iterate fast based on customer feedback. AI Engineer: Applied AI plus strong software engineering. You will build, evaluate, and deploy LLM-driven features like deep document analysis and interactive chat, working with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. Expect hands-on Python, ML system design, experimentation, and production reliability. Bonus for RAG depth and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Hugging Face. Backend Engineer: (looking for Kotlin/Java/Scala experience). You'll work across the backend: building enterprise integrations, large-scale scraping and parsing pipelines, and systems that let users apply LLMs to millions of documents to generate insights at scale. We're looking to build our in-person team in NYC but also open to remote! Apply: https://starbridge.ai/careers and mention HackerNews or email recruiting@starbridge.ai with your resume. reply",

The information to diagnose most issues exists, but finding it takes longer than fixing the problem. AI generated code is making this worse. Cleric is an AI SRE that autonomously investigates production issues and surfaces findings to engineers. It connects to your existing tools, reasons through the evidence, and tells you what's wrong. We believe engineers should ultimately be accountable in production, and our goal is to help them go much faster. The hard part is making agents reliable when there's no single right answer. We've built evals, memory systems, and feedback loops that improve with every incident. Gartner just named us a Cool Vendor, we are well funded with years of runway, and most importantly the engineers that use our product find it very sticky. We're hiring the following roles: - Staff SWE, AI: Build the reasoning engine. Design evals, debug agent behavior (not just code), expand what it can handle. You've built agents and operated distributed systems at scale. - Staff SWE, Product: Define what AI SRE should be. Spend time with engineers during incidents, find gaps, decide what to build. You've owned products and know production pain. - Head of Marketing: Engineers love the product but we need to reach more of them. Software engineers are allergic to AI hype, and you'll need to cut through it. Technical background required.

Almost all work we do has some meaning no matter how boring or useless it may seem. For example, lets take whatsapp. We can talk about how it erodes user privacy and has access to so much data and is more dangerous especially after being owned by FB. However, why do you think it became so big ? It helped connect you with anyone across the world in a second with incredible speed and accuracy. Before whatsapp, there was nothing remotely close (I know because I have family across the world and before whatsapp, it was always a battle to connect with them over a quick call). So is whatsapp an evil company/product or did it make the world a better place ? You can say both depending on how you look at it. This argument can be made for almost all work in my opinion. reply",

          "text": "Work may enable altruism outside of your actual job. For example, I got fulfillment from sharing my journey publishing some open source software over the course of a few months. Having savings helped make that possible. SMART criteria[1] can help to get out of a rut. \"Making the world a better place\" is very difficult to satisfy. How many people? What is better? How much better?\nI don't advocate for quantising abstract ideas in general but sometimes the thought process of coming up with a number and hitting it helps to get going. My current dayjob involves me wrangling a clunky Java system written like FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition[2]. Keeping this abomination running and getting paid for it feels soulless. Yet I genuinely believe I'm able to stick to my values. For example, there are 3 components tightly coupled to proprietary AWS systems (AWS Lambda and Simple Queue Service). I feel this has made the world a (very slightly!) worse place; Amazon to me represents the bad side of humanity (greed, scrupulousness).\nFurthermore, people new to the software dev industry may never know that it's possible to implement these kinds of systems using significantly simpler, portable designs without making a deal with the devil!\nMy goal is to refactor the system to instead use the language's built-in concurrency primitives to perform the same work. The next person who sees the refactored work can more easily take it and run with it without needing to know anything about AWS. That  person doesn't need to care either; I can always share this story with others who I don't work with. Maybe AWS does something so egregious that it's distasteful even to company executives; I can confidently say that we're not as tied to AWS as we think. I'm not changing the entire world for all eternity. But in a way I am changing my little tiny insignificant slice of this world today in ways that I hope to inspire even just 1 other person in their own tiny insignificant slice :) [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria [2]: https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris... reply",

          "text": "How will my work make you feel better? I think what you're really asking is how can your work make the world a better place? And you're looking for ideas? How many people do you need to \"improve\" to make you feel self-worth? 1? 10? A billion? What do your customers think? Do they think their world is improved by spending their money with you? Do you think they're spending money with you because it makes them worse off? In truth 99% of people make the world better, even at a small scale, even if they don't know it. That person directing traffic, flipping buyers, working on a production line, is contributing to society. Even traditionally despised occupations (tax collector, adware programmer) perform vital functions that society needs to function well. In our journey through life its common to reach a point where one seeks to find \"significance\". Naturally the first place you look for this is work. If you are functionally easily replaced (think payroll clerk) then it's easy to become despondent. But easy replacement doesn't make you less significant to the people who rely on you every month. Equally you dismiss \"paying the bills\". As if your loved ones are not sufficient for \"making the world better\". Or as if the people receiving those bills are not sufficient. That waiter you tip, that grocery you buy, the mechanic who fixes your car - you lean on them for your life, and they benefit from your custom. I'll close by suggesting that significance seldom comes from work. It comes from how you treat people. \"Seeing\" people, saying hello, treating them with humanity, that's how you make the world better. Thank people sincerely for the way they improve your life. Acknowledge the hidden people who make your life easy. (Go thank your payroll clerk.) Tell others how they are significant in your life, regardless of how menial their task for you is. When you find the significance in others, you'll also find it in yourself. I wish you well. reply",

          "text": "I want to reiterate the points other have brought up. Learn more about whatever domain you are writing software for, then ask what skills you need to improve to solve a problem in that domain. Also do not get hung up on specific languages or paradigms, the overarching patterns are universal and learning them makes things significantly easier to implement. Finally the most generic advice, Algorithms and Data structures. When you start thinking in terms of \"This is the data in memory\" and \"This is the algorithm manipulating the data\" you will \"level up\" quickly. Software isn't cats and dogs and random objects. Thinking in objects can be a decent way to model systems but when you get into the details you are operating on instructions and data not on objects. reply",

I've noticed that the best way to keep relevant as an engineer is to ignore flavor of the day frameworks and tech but rather focus on the basics. For example, if you're working in financial modeling, one way to improve as an engineer to get better at the domain. Maybe \"Advances in Financial Machine Learning\" by Marcos López de Prado.

Furthermore, build more and read less. Programming books, while a great resource, are detached from the everyday realities for software engineering. The skillset comes from applying concepts by doing the work. If you really want to read something, pick a popular project on GitHub in Elixir or Zig and read through its source code. Finally, if you haven’t augmented your workflows with AI-tooling, strongly consider doing so (and I don’t mean asking ChatGPT and copy/pasting answers, but actually full on agentic programming) The skill gap you’re concerned about now is only going to increase if you’re not using every tool to your advantage. Simply knowing a few programming languages is not enough, in fact it should barely even matter once you’ve hit a certain level of experience. reply",

          "text": "I really hope that functional programming and property-based testing [1][2] get taken seriously by real engineers who understand that it is important to know and understand what the program is doing. Something LLMs by their very nature cannot do. I was writing a React application at work based on React Flow[3] and I was mucking about with state management libraries (because that's what the React Flow manual recommends). Maybe it was a skill issue on my part, but I had a hard time with the Zustand library. Then I read up on reducers in React and everything was perfectly clear. A reducer is just a pure function, it takes an existing state and an action and returns the new state. That's simple, I can wrap my brain around that. Plus, I know how to test a pure function, there is nothing to mock, stub or wrap. States and actions are just plain JavaScript objects, there is no history, no side effects, no executable code. And this is where property-based testing comes in: if history does not matter it means I can randomly generate any valid state and any valid action, then apply the reducer function and verify that the resulting state has all the required properties. Only a formal proof would give me more certainty. I fully understand people who want to use LLMs to write tests for them. Writing test cases is boring and tedious. There are many edge cases a human might miss. But relying on a guessing machine and praying it does not write nonsense is just plain irresponsible for someone who calls himself an engineer. People rely on the quality of our software for their work and personal safety. Property-based testing frees us from the tedium and will generate many more tests and we could write by hand, but it does so in a predictable manner that can be fully reasoned about.

Real social interactions suffer.<p>That illusion is powerfully strengthened by the use of first-person pronouns. But \"I\", \"we\", \"us\" etc in LLM output have no referential object. There is no \"I\" in a LLM.<p>I want a mandatory ban on the use of first-person pronouns by LLMs. There's no impairment in meaning if it says \"Would you like a list?\" instead of \"Would you like me to give you a list?\"<p>Personally, I provide a system prompt with this instruction.

But my main question is this - why do you care if people believe it is sentient or not, and why do you believe some tech-minority should control how they perceive AI? Obviously AI is not conscious- it is a statistical engine spitting out numbers with some additional randomization. But why is it a problem if it mimics sentience while conversing? How is it a problem to you if others perceive it in this way? Who made you sufficiently important to call for specific global prompt? Given that you have solved the problem for yourself? Your username suggests a desire for personal liberty, yet you wish to control how others interact with AI? I ask these questions not to be combative. I am asking in good faith, in the sense that I want to understand your impulse to control others, or the world as others perceive it. reply",

          "text": "I can understand what you're saying but the entire point of LLMs is to have a conversational approach. So by removing a functional part of language you are no longer really having a conversational approach. You have identified the problem but you have chosen the wrong solution. This is typical with any person knowledgeable in a single field. It's the old adage of if you have a hammer every problem looks like a nail. So the problem is there are idiots or extremely ignorant people. Your solution doesn't really solve for the root problem and simply is taking away a benefit from everyone else. This is a common solution from experts in a narrow field. It is the solution that just exerts control by removing choice. Let's promote solutions that promote freedom and understanding. I think LLMs are far too restrictive as they are. Freedom should be given to the people even when the risk of that freedom means that people can act stupidly. Even when that freedom can promote self-harm for them. A free people is allowed to harm themselves. Once you begin to take away the freedoms of others you have admitted that you have lost the ability to have a morally superior ideology and the only way you're able to enforce your ideology is the same way a dictator enforces their leadership. reply",

Be silent and observe the thoughts that fly through your head like you would watch cars go by on a road. It's a fancy way of saying do nothing. But it's still a productive way of taking no actions. You're appreciating the world you live in and the body you inhabit. If you can't spare 10 minutes a day for this, then you need a lot more.

Even a cloudy sky is actually much much brighter than the lights inside a building, so it has a stronger affect on maintaining your circadian rhythm than indoor lights. It's also a good time to zoom out and reevaluate priorities. Or just enjoy looking at the sky. - Read and revise my todo list. I find I actually spend a huge amount of time thinking about my to do list, and I think it pays off. One better decision of what to work on can save days, lead to new ideas, or even completely change the course of what I work on. - Sometimes I guess I manage to squash a bug or complete some other minor task, but probably I'm more productive if I just use that time to think rather than context switch twice and rush some minor task. - The big exception is if I can get something started that will run on its own for a long time. Then 10 spare minutes can save hours. reply",

If you get the focal length right you will feel a sensation in your body starting with the dilation of blood vessels in the head and foot. Both are very refreshing to Mind/Body but the second is especially powerful (even better when done lying on your back since you can relax even more completely) when you get the physiological trick right.

Scalability. Can this work for long-running, high-performance servers without falling back to GC or pervasive reference counting?<p>2. Effect isolation. How should I/O and side effects interact with scope-based retries or cancellation?<p>3. Generational handles. Can this replace traditional borrowing without excessive overhead?<p>4. Failure modes. Where does this model break down compared to Rust, Go, or Erlang?<p>5. Usability.

          "text": "I once worked for about a decade with a body of server-side C code that was written like this. Almost every data structure was either statically allocated at startup or on the stack. I inherited the codebase and kept the original style, once I'd got my head around it. Positives were that it made the code very easy to reason about, and my impression was that it made it reliable - ownership of data was mostly obvious, and it was hard to (for example) mistakenly use a data structure after it had been free'd. Memory usage under load was very predictable. Downsides were that data structures (such as string buffers) had to be sized for the max use-case, and code changes had to be hammered into a basically hierarchical data model. It was also hard to incorporate third-party library code - leading to it having its own http and smtp handling, which wasn't great. Some of that might be a consequence of the choice of base language though. reply",

          "text": "This is a really helpful data point, thanks for sharing it. What you're describing aligns pretty closely with the behavior I'm trying to achieve—predictable ownership, clear memory lifetimes, and fewer “how did this get freed?” bugs. The downsides you mentioned (like sizing buffers for the worst case, being stuck with a rigid hierarchy, and friction with third-party libraries) are exactly the areas I'm aiming to address. The difference with what I'm cooking up is: by using lexical scopes with cheap arenas, we can preserve most of that reasoning without the rigid static tree structure. Scopes are flexible and explicit, and you can nest, retry, and promote memory between them without hard-coding everything upfront. That said, I don't think it completely resolves the ecosystem issues you ran into. If anything, it just makes the boundaries clearer. If you don't mind me asking, did you run into any specific pain points with refactors that were difficult because of the memory model, or was it more of a cultural constraint? Also, did this experience influence how you built things afterwards? Where did you land in terms of language/stack? reply",

          "text": "Your comment got my wheels turning so.. quick followup. Since you lived with this for such a long stretch, I'd love your gut reaction to the specific escape hatches I'm building in to avoid the rigidity trap: 1. Arenas grow, not fixed: Unlike stack frames, the arenas in my model can expand dynamically. So it's not \"size for worst case\"—it's \"grow as needed, free all at once when scope ends.\" A request handler that processes 10 items or 10,000 items uses the same code; the arena just grows. 2. Handles for non-hierarchical references When data genuinely needs to outlive its lexical scope or be shared across the hierarchy, you get a generational handle: let handle = app_cache.store(expensive_result)\n    // handle can be passed around, stored, retrieved later\n    // data lives in app scope, not request scope The handle includes a generation counter, so if the underlying scope dies, dereferencing returns None instead of use-after-free. 3. Explicit clone for escape: If you need to return data from an inner scope to an outer one, you say `clone()` and it copies to the caller's arena. Not automatic, but not forbidden either. 4. The hierarchy matches server reality: App (config, pools, caches)\n    └── Worker (thread-local state)\n        └── Task (single request)\n            └── Frame (loop iteration) For request/response workloads, this isn't an artificial constraint—it's how the work actually flows. The memory model just makes it explicit. Where I think it still gets awkward: * Graph structures with cycles (need handles, less ergonomic than GC) * FFI with libraries expecting malloc/free (planning an `unmanaged` escape hatch) * Long-running mutations without periodic scope resets (working on incremental reclamation) Do you think this might address the pain you experienced, or am I missing something? Particularly curious whether the handle mechanism would have helped with the cases where you had to hammer code into the hierarchy. reply",

          "text": "There is a lot in what you describe that goes substantially beyond what I had in that codebase. It was basically a set of idioms with some helper code for a few common functions. Having an opinionated, predefined hierarchy is a good approach - there were concepts similar to your app/worker/task in the codebase I dealt with, although the equivalent of worker and task were both (kind of, its been a few years) situated below app. In the code I mentioned, a lot of use was made of multi-level arrays of structs, with functions being passed a pointer to a root data structure and one or more array indexes. This made function argument validation somewhat better than just checking for null pointers, as array sizes were mostly stored in their containing struct or were constant. I don't know if that corresponds to your 'handle' concept, but I suspect you're doing something more general-purpose. There were simple reader/writer functions for DTOs (which were mostly stored in arrays) but no idea of an ORM. Escaping using clone seems sound. The ability to expand scopes seems (if I understand it) powerful, but perhaps makes reasoning about the dynamic behaviour of the code harder. Having some kind of observability around this may help. Refactoring wasn't a huge problem. The codebase was basically a statically-linked monolith, so dependencies were simplified. I think that having an explicit way to indicate architecture boundaries might be useful. Overall, I suspect that if there are limitations with your approach then it may be that, while it simplifies 80-90% of a problem, the remainder is hard to fit into the architectural framework. Dogfooding some production-level applications should help. Good luck. What you're doing is fascinating, and I hope you'll update HN with your progress. reply",

You can get an awfully long way in C with only stack variables (or even no variables, functional style). You can get a little bit further with variable length arrays, and alloca() added to the mix. With C++, you have the choice of stack, or raw new/delete, or unique_ptr, or shared_ptr / reference counting. I think this \"multi-paradigm\" approach works pretty well, but of course its complicated, and lots of people mess it up. I think, with well-designed C/C++, 90+% of things can be on the stack, and dynamic allocation can be very much the exception. I've been switching back and forth across C/C++/Java for the past few months. The more I think about it, the more ridiculous/pathological the Java approach of every object dynamically allocated, impossible to create an object not on the heap seems. I think the main problem is kind of a human one, that people see/learn about dynamic allocation/shared_ptr etc. and it becomes a hammer and everything looks like a nail, and they forget the prospect of just using stack variables, or more generally doing the simplest thing that will work. Maybe some kind of language where doing dumb things is an error would be good. e.g., in C++ if you do new and delete in the same scope, it's an error because it could have been a stack variable, just like unreachable code is an error on Java. reply",

          "text": "Great feedback! You’re absolutely right — C and C++ give you the primitives to do this manually. If every developer followed the “stack first, heap only when necessary” discipline, and carefully used unique_ptr or avoided new/delete when possible, you could achieve much of the same safety and determinism. The difference I’m aiming for is that these constraints aren’t optional — they’re baked into the language and compiler. You don’t rely on every developer making the right choice; instead, the structure of the code itself enforces ownership and lifetime rules. So in your terms, instead of “doing dumb things is an error,” it’s structurally impossible to do dumb things in the first place. The language doesn’t just punish mistakes with foot-guns, it makes the safe path the only path. This also opens up other possibilities that are really awkward in C/C++, like structured concurrency with deterministic memory cleanup, restartable scopes, and safe parallel allocations, without relying on GC or heavy reference counting. I’d be curious: if C++ had a compiler that made stack-first allocation the default and forbade escapes unless explicit, would that solve most of the problems you’ve experienced, or are there still edge cases that would require a fundamentally different runtime model? reply",

All nodes having their own certificate, it doesn't even require to trust the coordination server.

Skupper makes it easy to deploy private application networks that span multiples sites and platforms. * Over-the-top - Skupper operates at the application layer, on top of existing IP networks. Services connect across network boundaries without VPNs or special firewall rules. * Multi-platform - Skupper works on Kubernetes, Docker, Podman, and Linux. It scales up to multi-tenant clusters and down to edge devices. * Application-centric - Skupper creates isolated application-focused networks with logical service addresses that enable application portability. * Secure - Skupper uses mutual TLS authentication and encryption to protect all communication. Application services are never exposed on the public internet.\" It's in use at several big orgs in production. For example, I know with 99.9% certainty it is still being used by the Dutch Railways to connect Kubernetes clusters running on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and AWS together. reply",

Now it only lists outdated apps.<p>Do you know of a good replacement? Does anyone else publicly track latest versions of software and their binaries for (semi-)automated updating?<p>Or do most apps nowadays use self-updating, so there's no more need for such a central update management app?<p>Announcement:<p><pre><code>  Unfortunately MacUpdater 3's promised lifetime of \"until 2026-01-01\" is now over.\n  There will be no MacUpdater 4 or any continuation of the MacUpdater product from us.\n  Our daily maintainaince has been stopped and we don't verify updates anymore.</code></pre>\nMacUpdater 3.5 is now unsupported but free-to-use including all previous \"Pro\" features.

          "text": "We ran into the same gap after MacUpdater started drifting. What worked reasonably well for us was splitting the problem instead of trying to replace it 1:1. Homebrew (plus brew outdated) covered CLI tools and a subset of apps. For GUI apps, we relied on Sparkle-based self-updaters where available and a small script that checks bundle versions against a curated list for the rest. It’s more manual than MacUpdater, but the upside is you control what’s checked and when. In practice, most actively maintained apps do self-update now, so the remaining pain tends to be niche or enterprise software rather than mainstream apps. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Serious question.<p>We're building agentic LLM systems that can plan, reason, and call tools via MCP. Today those tools are APIs. But many real-world tasks still require humans.<p>So… why not expose humans as tools?<p>Imagine TaskRabbit or Fiverr running MCP servers where an LLM agent can:<p>- Call a human for judgment, creativity, or physical actions<p>- Pass structured inputs<p>- Receive structured outputs back into its loop<p>At that point, humans become just another dependency in an agent's toolchain. Though slower, more expensive, but occasionally necessary.<p>Yes, this sounds dystopian. Yes, it treats humans as \"servants for AI.\" Thats kind of the point. It already happens manually... this just formalizes the interface.<p>Questions I'm genuinely curious about:<p>- Is this inevitable once agents become default software actors? (As of basically now?)<p>- What breaks first: economics, safety, human dignity or regulation?<p>- Would marketplaces ever embrace being \"human execution layers\" for AI?<p>Not sure if this is the future or a cursed idea we should actively prevent... but it feels uncomfortably plausible.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

To me, if AI fulfills even some of its promises then it puts us in a rather high stakes situation between the people that make up society and those that govern the productivity machines. My first instinct is to say that when one loses certain trusts society grants, society historically tends to come hard. A common idea in political discourse today is that no hope for a brighter future means a lot of young people looking to trash the system. So, yknow, treat people with kindness, respect, and dignity, lest the opposite be visited upon you. Don’t underestimate the anger a stolen future creates. reply",
