It's not perfect, but it's taken it from being an issue that made all our transcripts look terrible, to an issue I no longer think about. I imagine just using the second spellchecking pass with Gemini would be almost as effective. reply",

Feed it that list and the transcript along with a simple prompt along the lines of \"Attached is a transcript of a conversation created from an audio file. The model doing the transcription has trouble with company names/industry terms/acronyms/whatever else and will have made errors with those.

The list of corrections should include the original version of the word that you fixed, what you updated it to, and where it is in the document.\" If it's getting things wrong, you can also ask it to give an explanation of why it made each change that it did and use that to iterate on your prompt and the context you're giving it with your list of words. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I posted this last year asking for help in creating an introduction to software development for 3rd graders:<p><pre><code>  \"Next week I'm going into my daughter's classroom to teach about software engineering. I want to teach them about the magic of it.\"\n</code></pre>\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42056775<p>The best suggestion was<p><pre><code>  \"I think about the PB&amp;J demo a lot.\"\n</code></pre>\nIt was a big hit! I took a lot of the suggestions and had so much fun. I'm going to do it again for my 4th and 5th graders classes and could use some help in improving it.<p>A few highlights from last year:<p><pre><code>  * I brought a serrated knife and ketchup packets. When they said put the jelly on the bread with the knife, I gripped the serrated end and pretended my fingers bled (ketchup works great as blood). \n  * I brought in vaseline AKA petroleum jelly. When they said put jelly on the bread, I contemplated aloud \"Well, you said JELLY, and this says JELLY!\"\n</code></pre>\nI offered to give the sandwich to one lucky kid afterward, but surprisingly, no one took me up on the opportunity to eat a sandwich with peanut butter, vaseline and ketchup. Kids these days are so spoiled, 6-7!<p>This year I want to do it again. But, I want to add some ideas:<p><pre><code>  * importance of teamwork: I think this differentiates good software teams from bad teams.\n  * importance of good communication: I was thinking about teaching them about how important communication and planning is. Last year I had slips of paper where I asked a different scribe to write down the instructions, and then I took those, reordered them with class input and then took action. But, perhaps I can expand on that and really drill into them the value of planning and good written communication.\n  * managers: I was thinking about talking about how the managers are often the best paid, because they take responsibility for all the moving pieces, and the success or failure of the project.  I expect this might be a controversial take here on HN!\n</code></pre>\nAny suggestions?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Pre-teach how a balance works to compare the weight of items.  Ask them to put the items in order from lightest to heaviest.  You're basically asking them to come up with a sorting algorithm. Usually, after much experimentation, someone will come up with an algorithm that works. You can work together to try to write down the steps of the algorithm. You can also explore more mathematical ideas like transitivity when comparing different sorted sets of items. reply",

There's a good article about it here with some links: https://blog.codinghorror.com/modern-logo/ Also don't ignore Scratch: if you can teach familiarity in Scratch you are going to set your daughter up really well for all sorts of stuff.

Eventually, I think you end up using loop command cards, etc. I'd imagine you could have teams control each bunny.

You could just increase the difficulty by requiring more precise instructions? Ah, you split the list of instructions into four parts and put one list in each corner of the classroom, then randomly sort people into the corners - one corner has ingredients, one corner has operations, one corner has conditionals, one corner has goals, and the class has to communicate to build valid instructions. Maybe give the ingredients tongue-twister names and make them devise ways to communicate without getting things confused. And obviously the end of the demo is \"so why didn't any of you just take a list of ingredients and walk over to the list of operations so you didn't have to shout?\". reply",

The younger one was extremely happy and and full of admiration. Even if my older daughter gets a Nobel price, she will not reach the same level in the appreciation scale.

          "text": "Shaggy dog story: when I was 9 my teacher assigned us homework that entailed writing an instructional essay on how to make the infamous PB&J sandwich. At the time I was a budding \"programmer\" and had recently seen a skit on a TV show that employed hijinks similar to > * I brought a serrated knife and ketchup packets. When they said put the jelly on the bread with the knife, I gripped the serrated end and pretended my fingers bled (ketchup works great as blood). >  * I brought in vaseline AKA petroleum jelly. When they said put jelly on the bread, I contemplated aloud \"Well, you said JELLY, and this says JELLY!\" ...and so went into great prescriptive detail about exactly how I'd make said sandwich. After turning it in my teacher chose my essay specifically to repro onto a transparency and place on the overhead as an example of bad writing. Apparently being explicit about choice of ingredients, removing things from packaging, holding the bread, etc. was antithetical to the assignment and dismissed with laughter and eye rolls because \"everybody knows\" to do these things. This was a bit of a blow to my fragile ego but in retrospect it was an important lesson in several concepts that you touch on later in your post such as good communication (the importance of considering one's audience), asking clarifying questions (because requirements are hard), and interactions with authority figures. I say all of this to say that you should absolutely emphasize this less technical side of things. Soft skills are at least as important as technical aptitude when it comes to career mobility and emphasizing them early would give students a real leg up. While considering edge cases and assumptions is clearly important for computers it's also crucial to keep in mind how people understand processes and systems, i.e. when to be explicit and when to avoid patronizing those on the other end of your comms. reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

I feel like he depends on me for a lot, and since I don't have a clear answer for him in this situation since I'm actually involved in it, I think he doesn't know what to do. He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

          "text": "Based on what you’ve written, you owe it to your skip to have this conversation with him. This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.). Curious as the advice rings sound, but I only saw your consultancy work. reply",

Three outcomes in order of likelihood: - they take the hint and leave - they improve enough to get the PIP off them - you have justification for disciplinary actions including termination.

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

And giving validation to their belief that they should have \"important jobs\" just gives them real power to bully you more.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\").

As far as I can tell, your only real course of action is to learn to live with him. I've worked with many people like this. Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.” - Marcus Aurelius, \"Meditations\" reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities. Maybe they like him because he is a nice person or because his lack of leadership gets them something they want. reply",

It’s plausible, sure. But the manager could just as easily be trying to avoid (needed) conflict. To your second point, there’s MANY other explanations. We don’t know how the team reacted for a start - maybe they did back up OP. Or maybe, based on the alleged jerk’s aggressive behaviour to the team in the past, they felt scared to speak up. Or maybe they’re junior. Or maybe you’re right and all 9 people unanimously felt OP was in the wrong. My point wasn’t any of this though, it was mainly: avoid coming to such harsh judgments based on so much extrapolation. Criticise the reported actions, sure, discuss some hypotheticals, but going straight for “you’re a bad leader” goes a bit beyond. reply",

And they weren't asked to stand up for their own opinion, but for their team leads opinion.

But having to go through your manager to force through a totally reasonable decision that is yours to make is being a bad leader. I do not think that there is any alternative interpretation then that this event at least is a failure in leadership. I am saying this because I want to tell OP how his situation sounds to a complete outsider. OP was there if the 9 guys all immediately stood up for him and told the other guy that he was clearly in the wrong, then this obviously disproves everything I said and OP knows that I am wrong. But if they did not, then he should reconsider his actions and at least allow for the possibility that this was a failure on part of his leadership. reply",

          "text": "I think there are four pieces of evidence: - One person on the team does not respect him. That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

          "text": "Twice so far, though not in as stark terms, and not recently. Once, I told him to knock it off trying to make a peer engineer who was underperforming look bad in front of the team, and instead to inform our manager of cases where he believed the engineer was underperforming, but not to try to embarrass or humiliate him -- the other engineer was extremely distressed by this engineer. He did stop. Another case he seemed to understand in our 1:1, but ramped up writing long slack comments that read to me as passive-aggressive. There's a very high risk of things blowing up since there isn't a strong groundwork of trust to begin with, and since things blew up with the previous lead who was too direct with him, so I'm wary to do this without the involvement of my manager. At first when I joined the team we seemed to have a good amount of trust since I was sympathetic to things that happened in the past to him -- he was treated very unfairly from a director who'd since been fired who let blame travel down directly onto this engineer. The director way over-promised and underestimated and caused the team to face tons of criticism. Most of the burden fell on this engineer; his peers were very little help, and the project was way too large. It was doomed from the start. Everyone on the team flamed each other in year-end reviews. The lead said everyone on the team, including himself, should be fired. It was extremely bad. Eventually as I disagreed with him and saw he really didn't want /anything/ he'd worked on to change, we started to have conflict. I ended up having a lot more responsibilities added, and decreased the rate at which I held 1:1s with all my peers -- I think he felt insulted, and called off our 1:1s completely. reply",

          "text": "I work with students and junior engs. Personally, I'd avoid using AI tools for learning atm. 1) As a learning path planning tool, I find LLM tools are very good at creating learning plans and next steps for popular concepts. However, the convenience of the tool also skips over a lot of accidental discovery/exposure, which IMO is useful in the long run in building out broader contextual awareness. The students following an AI plan only knows about the things in immediate vincitiy. Whereas more traditional methods, like a web search (use someting like Kagi, not Google) reveals more advanced stuff which they don't know yet, but plants a seed in their brains. With the right prompting system, you can probably mitigate some of these issues, but atm I find the general trend is people want short fast answers. 2) For actual coding I'd discourage it. For people to learn quickly they have to build stuff from scratch so they develop the right mental models. Writing code manually is a good check on their understanding. When the work becomes boring/tedious they can offload it to AI tools. Overall, my experience has been that the AI tools are useful in the short term, but too much reliance amputates a lot of the valuable, but hard to measure, learning experiences. If the goal is to form the right mental model of concepts in the human who is learning, then bypassing some of the \"work\" and frustration by letting AI do most of the planning and \"thinking\" actually harms the learning process. reply",

You can literally learn almost anything, and it's at the very least a starting point, and then you ask it for the best books to continue with. For people that like learning on their own, it opens up all doors. With that in mind, as you're learning build everything by hand. Copy the code by typing it, not copy/pasting. Make sure you understand each line and can change things as you go while still having it compile and work. Start with actual projects, first small projects, then larger and larger. Each project should be something you can show someone else, if not upload and share online. Once you have a few projects, the path forward reveals itself and you'll know which books to read and what to tackle next. Honestly, for learning programming, university is no longer needed.

That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

Congrats, the only way to generate temporary credentials is to instead use a non-FIDO MFA device on the main account. Nobody is getting a phishing email, going to the terminal, generating STS credentials, and then feeding those into the phish. The phish is punting them to a fake AWS webpage. Temporary credentials are a mitigation for session token theft, not for phishing. reply",

We were only quickly tipped off because they had to open a ticket to get the limit raised. If you haven't check newly made Roles as well. We quashed the compromised users pretty quickly (including my own, the origin we figured out), but got a little lucky because I just started cruising the Roles and killing anything less than a month old or with admin access. To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request. It is entirely possible whomever did your thing had you compromised for a bit, and then once AWS went down they decided that was the perfect time to attack, when you might not notice just-another-AWS-thing happening. reply",

This is because of something called a \"collapse hit\" where two requests that occur at the same time and are identical (according to your cache key) get merged together into a single origin request. CloudFront isn't \"storing\" anything, but the effect is still that a user gets a copy of a response that was already returned to a different user. > https://stackoverflow.com/a/69455222 > If your app authenticates based on cookies or some other header, and that header isn't part of the cache key, it's possible for one user to get a response intended for a different user. To fix it you have to make sure any headers that affect the server response are in the cache key, even if the server always returns no-store. --- Though the AWS docs seem to imply that no-store is effective: > If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 and configure the origin to send Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-store, Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: max-age=0, or Cache-Control: s-maxage=0. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Develope... reply",

          "text": "I'm officially off of AWS so don't have any consoles to check against, but back on  a laptop. Based on docs and some of the concerns about this happening to someone else, I would probably start with the following: 1. Check who/what created those EC2s[0] using the console to query: eventSource:ec2.amazonaws.com eventName:RunInstances 2. Based on the userIdentity field, query the following actions. 3. Check if someone manually logged into Console (identity dependent) [1]: eventSource:signin.amazonaws.com userIdentity.type:[Root/IAMUser/AssumedRole/FederatedUser/AWSLambda] eventName:ConsoleLogin 4. Check if someone authenticated against Security Token Service (STS) [2]: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:GetSessionToken 5. Check if someone used a valid STS Session to AssumeRole: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:AssumeRole  userIdentity.arn (or other identifier) 6. Check for any new IAM Roles/Accounts made for persistence: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateUser OR eventName:DeleteUser) 7.  Check if any already vulnerable IAM Roles/Accounts modified to be more permissive [3]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateRole OR eventName:DeleteRole OR eventName:AttachRolePolicy OR eventName:DetachRolePolicy) 8. Check for any access keys made [4][5]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateAccessKey OR eventName:DeleteAccessKey) 9. Check if any production / persistent EC2s have had their IAMInstanceProfile changed, to allow for a backdoor using EC2 permissions from a webshell/backdoor they could have placed on your public facing infra. [6] etc. etc. But if you have had a compromise based on initial investigations, probably worth while getting professional support to do a thorough audit of your environment.

Granted, we have a separate team working on \"genAI stuff.\" We started converting virtual machines about 3 weeks ago and we've gotten through ~500 of about 3500 or so. Our grant based HPC environment is just moving back to bare metal. The VM conversion is just for ad-hoc HPC and then all of our general infrastructure. Some of our larger application servers (SAP Hana) are possibly staying on VMWare if SAP won't support them on Hyper-V. This summer sucked big time but we'll make it. reply",

HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV.

They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

          "text": "Check out libvirtd based stacks, because that's what's supported by upstream Linux. Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

          "text": "I'm with a block storage vendor that works with a lot of companies migrating off VMware, and the diversity of KVM-based cloud management platforms we're seeing is fascinating. We have customers moving to OpenNebula, CloudStack, Proxmox, OpenStack, HP VME, Oracle Virtualization, and even some homegrown solutions. The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible. reply",

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

          "text": "We're driving as many apps as possible to containers, and replacing most of our virtual infrastructure with Talos Linux [1] which is a reasonably  hardened OS dedicated to Kubernetes hosting.  I strongly recommend using the terraform provider to help manage at scale.  The docs seem  a little sparse for beginners, but if you already know kubernetes concepts, it's pretty easy to pick up.  If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize. They have to explain to the board why their spending increased and they are still on legacy. - [1] - https://www.talos.dev/ reply",

I'm too dumb for Rust, Go's was close but lack of exceptions and classes made it not for me. Fpc hit the sweet spot. The syntax is a little clunky but I have classes when I need them, exception handling, memory management - both auto and manual and cross platform support.

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

          "text": "Because Passkeys are considered more secure. They had a rough, confusing start but seem to be taking off. I don't know your level of technical knowledge, but Passkeys  replace passwords by using public key cryptography instead of shared secrets (passwords). They consist of a key pair (public and private) and are based on the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard. Like other public key systems (PGP, SSH keys, or SSL certificates), the public key is shared while the private key remains secret. There are two main types of Passkeys: device-bound and synced . Both types are significantly more secure than passwords and resistant to phishing, but they have different trade-offs between security and convenience. Device-Bound Passkeys: With device-bound Passkeys, the private key is stored in a Secure Enclave or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on your device. The Secure Enclave and TPM are hardware-isolated, preventing even your operating system from directly accessing them. Instead, you use a special authentication API to make calls. There is no direct memory access to these keys unless an exploit is discovered. Think of a Secure Enclave and Trusted Platform Modules as a little, isolated computer inside your device -- because that's what they are! They have their own processor and operating system, and they are completely isolated from the rest of the device. They only release signatures and never release secrets (and aren't even capable of doing so, under normal cases). The device can only talk to the Secure Enclave/TPM via special authentication APIs. Synced Passkeys: Synced Passkeys store the private key in encrypted form within a password manager or platform keychain (like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or 1Password. These passkeys are designed to be backed up and synchronized across your devices for convenience. While the keys are encrypted during storage and transit, they're not permanently bound to a single hardware chip. This makes them more flexible and user-friendly, though they rely on the security of your account and the encryption used by the syncing service rather than hardware isolation. Here's how the flow works as I understand it: 1. You visit a website and try to login. 2. The server sends a randomized challenge string. 3. Your device's authenticator signs that challenge using the private key. 4. That signature gets sent back to the server. 5. The server verifies the signature using the public key it has on file. Why Passkeys are cool: - No shared secrets, so there's nothing on the server that's useful to steal. - They're phishing resistant, the browser or whatever ensures the origin matches before allowing auth. - No replay attacks because the server issues a new randomized challenge string every time. - No cred stuffing because each passkey is unique to the service it's generated for. This should all be correct to the best of my unexpert knowledge. --- Edit: Corrected some serious errors and forgot to explain device-bound vs. synced passkeys -- a major oversight! Disclaimer: Yes, I'm a human and I use --. This comment is self-written but I did use AI for grammar correction. reply",

As a file on disk? Seems like bad idea - too easy to steal. Instead of that we can store them in dedicated hardware like yubikeys or tpm module. And the great thing is they are resistent to phishing because certificates use mathematics and can not be fooled by wrong url in browser address bar.

For me it's less about needing stimulation and more about managing the side effects of what I'm already using (coffee). If I could get the alertness without the jitters/anxiety, that'd be the win.

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

I feel like he depends on me for a lot, and since I don't have a clear answer for him in this situation since I'm actually involved in it, I think he doesn't know what to do. He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed. It's really difficult since it can all be covered up as just doing work and participating in the team -- that's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior like this. reply",

This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand.

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things.

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.” - Marcus Aurelius, \"Meditations\" reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic.

You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings.

Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization.

I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it.

I’m mostly done trying to make things work with this guy. I’ll move up to my skip if I keep getting hassled like this. reply",

Explain that it’s a challenge running the group, historically there have been issues even before you showed up. Point out that many skills are needed to run the group, and when he acts a certain way, it’s way harder for you and his is also demonstrating he is weak in these executive level skills. Then listen to him in his points. Discuss if relevant. Does he have points or is he a nut. Then, tell him you need to re-baseline expectations. Explain how things need to operate. Summarize the discussion in email and send it to him. Separately send a write up to your boss in the conversation. Again, this is not an attempt to throw him under the bus, just to get him aligned with direction.\nBut if the re-baseline of expectations fails, you can work to take more steps regarding his review.\nI wonder if your team does not have a good well defined engineering leader. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...). Which kinda shows that your manager does not agree with your viewpoint. If you take his words at face value, he is pretty much telling you that you are the problem. Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities.

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

Spend the first week taking time after the meeting taking an hour to write down all the things you should have said to \"disarm\" this person. It's less about the delivery and more that you have a message to send ready. reply",

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

          "text": "I don't think you can tackle this purely from a hardware side. If you want to send input from the laptop to another system, there's no kind of USB profile available to collect input from a system. You're going to need software on the laptop to gather the input. That seems necessary. You're not going to invent a purely hardware based solution here. Given that, I'd abandon your starting requirement of needing two usb device ports. That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

          "text": "I'd still 100% recommend using ethernet, with two usb<->ethernet adapters on each end and a cable in-between to direct link the two. It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

Do you have any suggestion? 2) This specific chip is marked NRND (not recommended for new designs) on ftdi's website, So it feels slightly wrong to use it? reply",

Is there any kind of existing IPMI/ILO/etc functionality in the target machine that you could use? If not: You need something that can act as a usb \"device\" (the \"host\" and \"device\" sides of a usb connection are very different). A search for \"usb keyboard emulator\" turns up a lot of projects in that area. I'm not sure you're going to get much simpler than a pi-zero or teensy, unless you can find someone selling a pre built device that meets your needs. If you're lucky, your laptop has a usb port that can be configured to take the \"device\" role instead of the usual \"host\" role. In that case you could probably build a software-only solution using the Linux usb \"gadget\" framework to make that port act like a keyboard when attached to the target's usb port. reply",

          "text": "I'm still refining and working on my coding agent, VT Code. Two weeks ago, I posted a comment [0] to regular Ask HN: What are you doing this week? and got out-of my expectation feedback. Thank you HN community! The last 2 weeks I have been making constants and regular update to VT Code, and it still evolving to a hopefully more capable coding agent. Most recent notable release is official VS Code extension and OpenVSX distribution [1][2] so that you can use VT Code agent inside your favorite code IDE like VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, Kiro and Eclipse. About VT Code, it is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code intelligence via Tree-sitter (parsers for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java) and ast-grep (structural pattern matching and refactoring). It supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax; all with automatic failover, prompt caching, and token-efficient context management. Configuration occurs entirely through vtcode.toml, sourcing constants from vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs and model IDs from docs/models.json to ensure reproducibility and avoid hardcoding. [3] Recently I've added Agent Client Protocol (ACP) integration. VT Code is now a fully compatible ACP agent, works with any ACP-clients: Zed (first-class support), Neovim, marimo notebook.

          "text": "This weekend a VIP forgot their VPN password, tried to log in 50+ times, and got their home IP permanently blocked by the anti bruteforce setting on their firewall. Their helpdesk got confused and escalated, then their network team, who knew their internet wasnt down, escalated it as a massive emergency internet down. PRTG was clear on both sides that it wasnt down. To make it even more confusing, a totally separate unrelated major peering link actually went down at the same time for the ISP, so ISP helpdesk assumed it was related. It wasnt. When that peering came back, the problem was still occurring, but it escalates up the chain for the major internet outage that both sides of the networking teams agreed wasnt happening. The root cause, besides forgotten password and failing >50 times was just that our security policy doesn't auto-expire the IP block. Something the firewall doesnt let you configure. About a month prior to this, they had hackers hitting the remote vpn trying to brute force in, resulting in AD locking out many accounts, since the firewall didnt block. I recommended to implement brute forcing protection but to set the # high so as to avoid real users from getting blocked. But this 'major internet outage' that only affected 1 person on their home network is my fault. So yesterday I started building a flask app that can manage the block list. reply",

Help him read other people's source code instead of summarizing it using AI. Those little exercises are still good projects IMO. Find where his passion is about (it could be making games, or making apps to help his girlfriend do X, or drilling into computer architecture), and help him to build up the ability to teach himself using material offline. And train his patience, too. With so many free helping hands nowadays, it is very important to be patient and NOT seek out help unless one has exhausted all available venues at hand. My thumb of rule is \"3-night\" -- if he cannot find the answer or even make an progress for 3 nights, he needs to seek external help. But build up his tolerance towards frustration -- in pretty much all trades, programming included, tradesmen need to retain the ability to tolerate certain level towards frustration -- otherwise they would achieve nothing. Build up his tolerance towards frustration, build up his tolerance towards boredom. IMO it helps to sit with him to debug programs step by step. reply",

          "text": "I work with students and junior engs. Personally, I'd avoid using AI tools for learning atm. 1) As a learning path planning tool, I find LLM tools are very good at creating learning plans and next steps for popular concepts. However, the convenience of the tool also skips over a lot of accidental discovery/exposure, which IMO is useful in the long run in building out broader contextual awareness. The students following an AI plan only knows about the things in immediate vincitiy. Whereas more traditional methods, like a web search (use someting like Kagi, not Google) reveals more advanced stuff which they don't know yet, but plants a seed in their brains. With the right prompting system, you can probably mitigate some of these issues, but atm I find the general trend is people want short fast answers. 2) For actual coding I'd discourage it. For people to learn quickly they have to build stuff from scratch so they develop the right mental models. Writing code manually is a good check on their understanding. When the work becomes boring/tedious they can offload it to AI tools. Overall, my experience has been that the AI tools are useful in the short term, but too much reliance amputates a lot of the valuable, but hard to measure, learning experiences. If the goal is to form the right mental model of concepts in the human who is learning, then bypassing some of the \"work\" and frustration by letting AI do most of the planning and \"thinking\" actually harms the learning process. reply",

You can literally learn almost anything, and it's at the very least a starting point, and then you ask it for the best books to continue with. For people that like learning on their own, it opens up all doors. With that in mind, as you're learning build everything by hand. Copy the code by typing it, not copy/pasting. Make sure you understand each line and can change things as you go while still having it compile and work. Start with actual projects, first small projects, then larger and larger. Each project should be something you can show someone else, if not upload and share online. Once you have a few projects, the path forward reveals itself and you'll know which books to read and what to tackle next. Honestly, for learning programming, university is no longer needed.

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

          "text": "Because Passkeys are considered more secure. They had a rough, confusing start but seem to be taking off. I don't know your level of technical knowledge, but Passkeys  replace passwords by using public key cryptography instead of shared secrets (passwords). They consist of a key pair (public and private) and are based on the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard. Like other public key systems (PGP, SSH keys, or SSL certificates), the public key is shared while the private key remains secret. There are two main types of Passkeys: device-bound and synced . Both types are significantly more secure than passwords and resistant to phishing, but they have different trade-offs between security and convenience. Device-Bound Passkeys: With device-bound Passkeys, the private key is stored in a Secure Enclave or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on your device. The Secure Enclave and TPM are hardware-isolated, preventing even your operating system from directly accessing them. Instead, you use a special authentication API to make calls. There is no direct memory access to these keys unless an exploit is discovered. Think of a Secure Enclave and Trusted Platform Modules as a little, isolated computer inside your device -- because that's what they are! They have their own processor and operating system, and they are completely isolated from the rest of the device. They only release signatures and never release secrets (and aren't even capable of doing so, under normal cases). The device can only talk to the Secure Enclave/TPM via special authentication APIs. Synced Passkeys: Synced Passkeys store the private key in encrypted form within a password manager or platform keychain (like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or 1Password. These passkeys are designed to be backed up and synchronized across your devices for convenience. While the keys are encrypted during storage and transit, they're not permanently bound to a single hardware chip. This makes them more flexible and user-friendly, though they rely on the security of your account and the encryption used by the syncing service rather than hardware isolation. Here's how the flow works as I understand it: 1. You visit a website and try to login. 2. The server sends a randomized challenge string. 3. Your device's authenticator signs that challenge using the private key. 4. That signature gets sent back to the server. 5. The server verifies the signature using the public key it has on file. Why Passkeys are cool: - No shared secrets, so there's nothing on the server that's useful to steal. - They're phishing resistant, the browser or whatever ensures the origin matches before allowing auth. - No replay attacks because the server issues a new randomized challenge string every time. - No cred stuffing because each passkey is unique to the service it's generated for. This should all be correct to the best of my unexpert knowledge. --- Edit: Corrected some serious errors and forgot to explain device-bound vs. synced passkeys -- a major oversight! Disclaimer: Yes, I'm a human and I use --. This comment is self-written but I did use AI for grammar correction. reply",

Web server can ask a certificate from your web browser to validate your identity. So both ends know that the other is legitimate. Now the question is where to store that certificate? As a file on disk? Seems like bad idea - too easy to steal. Instead of that we can store them in dedicated hardware like yubikeys or tpm module. And the great thing is they are resistent to phishing because certificates use mathematics and can not be fooled by wrong url in browser address bar. So generally passkeys are just authentication using certificates.

          "text": "You’re not alone—many teams pivoted fast to agent-written code, and it can feel like craftsmanship no longer matters. A few concrete moves: - Have a candid 1:1: say you’re misaligned with the process, but propose owning guardrails leadership cares about—reliability, security, test coverage, CI policies, prompt/eval hygiene. Suggest measuring outcomes beyond velocity: defect escape rate, change failure rate, MTTR, SLOs, incident cost.\n- Differentiate where agents are weak: ambiguous requirements, system design, debugging gnarly prod issues, performance tuning, threat modeling, compliance. Volunteer for those areas.\n- Use AI defensively: generate tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, docs, migrations; prune agent output; write prompts/evals to reduce rework and incidents.\n- Protect yourself: keep a brag doc with quantified impact, network for internal transfers, and quietly explore roles that still value rigor (fintech, healthcare, infra, aerospace, devtools).\n- Set a 60–90 day window. If nothing changes, execute an exit plan rather than burn out. It’s okay to be disillusioned. Your edge now is owning quality, risk, and outcomes—things the org can’t ignore even when throughput is cheap. reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And his manager should be coaching this directly. As the EM, you want your whole team to be able to confidently do what he does.

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your advice. > your manager isn’t doing his job Yeah, I do believe this and agree. My manager's new, and hasn't gotten much guidance or mentorship. I feel like he depends on me for a lot, and since I don't have a clear answer for him in this situation since I'm actually involved in it, I think he doesn't know what to do. He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed. It's really difficult since it can all be covered up as just doing work and participating in the team -- that's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior like this. reply",

This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand. It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. It's easy to say \"don't condescend to your teammates\".

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

Give him important jobs etc. It's easier after you go for drink/coffee and become a bit more chill with each other. And if he fails on something sensitive that you gave him then you don't have to struggle for proof to management that he sucks But maybe BE prepared to confront if he starts it? Maybe it's just me but it's dreadful if you bring it up and this guy shoots you down with some snark and you freeze out of surprise and lose the meeting. I would if you are value to company and he is really being an outright asshole on this meeting be prepared to say \"look if you're not gonna genuinely cooperate as your lead I'll officially file a complaint/recommend to boot you from this team/whatever\" and leave.

They seem to make a point that their own main contribution is bringing stability (good vibes?) to the team. It could be the story of a weak or unaware engineer/employee that has been promoted to a level they thought implied some sort of impunity. Because being reviewed or questioned weakens the public perception of them, they experience it as unfair and toxic. Using the word \"trivial\" to characterise critique directed towards them could be emotionally rather than technically motivated. reply",

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\").

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...). Which kinda shows that your manager does not agree with your viewpoint. If you take his words at face value, he is pretty much telling you that you are the problem. Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities. Maybe they like him because he is a nice person or because his lack of leadership gets them something they want. reply",

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

Even if I am wrong about everything, the one thing I am absolutely certain about is that this one engineer sees you as a failure in leadership. And if he sees you as a failure in leadership (and has at least some positive opinions about his teammates, if he doesn't you are in far deeper trouble with him) then he must believe that the rest of your team does not believe in your leadership either.

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

          "text": "There is another thing in here to add to the feedback about why won’t be moving up. If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

          "text": "I don't think you can tackle this purely from a hardware side. If you want to send input from the laptop to another system, there's no kind of USB profile available to collect input from a system. You're going to need software on the laptop to gather the input. That seems necessary. You're not going to invent a purely hardware based solution here. Given that, I'd abandon your starting requirement of needing two usb device ports. That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

          "text": "I'd still 100% recommend using ethernet, with two usb<->ethernet adapters on each end and a cable in-between to direct link the two. It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

I'm not sure you're going to get much simpler than a pi-zero or teensy, unless you can find someone selling a pre built device that meets your needs. If you're lucky, your laptop has a usb port that can be configured to take the \"device\" role instead of the usual \"host\" role.

          "text": "I know it might sound cliche but walking is an easy habit to start and keep up with. I tend to walk when I get stuck on a problem and try to distract my mind with something else. Usually this turns into my subconscious working through the problem until I get an idea to try out. The health benefits are very nice too if you’re just starting out. There are diminishing returns as your body gets used to it. 15 minutes in the morning/afternoon is my usually habit while at work. But on particularly tough days or just ones with nice weather I’d go for much longer walks. It’s nice to explore the spaces around you when on these walks. You’ll end up discovering more of your surroundings than you’d ever expect. One nice benefit I’ve found is that I can do a 35ish minute walk to the movie theater I’d normally drive to. Doing this lets me just go see a movie on a whim, eat at one of the many restaurants near it. Maybe get a little drunk and be able to walk off a meal/buzz on the way back. I’ve had many epiphanies in this state of mind. You’ll just be a more relaxed individual if you adopted this. reply",

          "text": "Think of all activities as repeated cycles, and consider the last step of every cycle to be resetting / restocking / refilling / setting up / preparing for the next cycle. (As opposed to how most people think of it: beginning activities by doing the initial set-up.) This has at least two benefits. First, it ensures follow-through (completion of what most people consider to be the last action). And second, it lowers the activation energy to start the next cycle. Examples: - \"You kill it, you fill it.\" When I make a cup of instant coffee and then the electric kettle is almost empty, I refill the kettle and start heating the water again before I grab my cup and return to my home office. As a result, the kettle is always full of hot water when I go back for another cup, and I don't have to go through the aggravation of refilling it and waiting around for it to heat up before I grab my next cup. (And refilling at the end is easier because I've already started doing the activity.) - Putting a new roll of toilet paper on the spindle. Likewise, if the replacement roll is the last one under the sink, restocking rolls under the sink after finishing in the bathroom. And if the package of rolls is almost empty after I restock the rolls under the sink, I immediately add TP to my grocery list. - Clearing my desk at the end of the work day and setting up my initial work materials for the morning. --- Another simple but great habit: using take-off and landing points at key places around the house to optimize in-home logistics and to avoid losing or spending time searching for things.

Most people would buy a shelf, maybe head to the Container Store, and try or organize it. I tend to get rid of it. This removes the clutter and opens up a new area of the home with new possibilities. At work when something goes wrong there is a whole call full of people suggesting on additional process, approvals, etc to add so it doesn’t happen again. I’m often the lone voice asking if we need to do the thing at all. If we stop doing it, it won’t break again and there is less work, not more. Everybody wins.

          "text": "I work with students and junior engs. Personally, I'd avoid using AI tools for learning atm. 1) As a learning path planning tool, I find LLM tools are very good at creating learning plans and next steps for popular concepts. However, the convenience of the tool also skips over a lot of accidental discovery/exposure, which IMO is useful in the long run in building out broader contextual awareness. The students following an AI plan only knows about the things in immediate vincitiy. Whereas more traditional methods, like a web search (use someting like Kagi, not Google) reveals more advanced stuff which they don't know yet, but plants a seed in their brains. With the right prompting system, you can probably mitigate some of these issues, but atm I find the general trend is people want short fast answers. 2) For actual coding I'd discourage it. For people to learn quickly they have to build stuff from scratch so they develop the right mental models. Writing code manually is a good check on their understanding. When the work becomes boring/tedious they can offload it to AI tools. Overall, my experience has been that the AI tools are useful in the short term, but too much reliance amputates a lot of the valuable, but hard to measure, learning experiences. If the goal is to form the right mental model of concepts in the human who is learning, then bypassing some of the \"work\" and frustration by letting AI do most of the planning and \"thinking\" actually harms the learning process. reply",

Find where his passion is about (it could be making games, or making apps to help his girlfriend do X, or drilling into computer architecture), and help him to build up the ability to teach himself using material offline. And train his patience, too. With so many free helping hands nowadays, it is very important to be patient and NOT seek out help unless one has exhausted all available venues at hand. My thumb of rule is \"3-night\" -- if he cannot find the answer or even make an progress for 3 nights, he needs to seek external help. But build up his tolerance towards frustration -- in pretty much all trades, programming included, tradesmen need to retain the ability to tolerate certain level towards frustration -- otherwise they would achieve nothing. Build up his tolerance towards frustration, build up his tolerance towards boredom. IMO it helps to sit with him to debug programs step by step. reply",

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

It's kind of 2-in-1 language, but the ecosystem is primarily focused on the high level part, so you can only depend on small portion of it.

          "text": "Because Passkeys are considered more secure. They had a rough, confusing start but seem to be taking off. I don't know your level of technical knowledge, but Passkeys  replace passwords by using public key cryptography instead of shared secrets (passwords). They consist of a key pair (public and private) and are based on the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard. Like other public key systems (PGP, SSH keys, or SSL certificates), the public key is shared while the private key remains secret. There are two main types of Passkeys: device-bound and synced . Both types are significantly more secure than passwords and resistant to phishing, but they have different trade-offs between security and convenience. Device-Bound Passkeys: With device-bound Passkeys, the private key is stored in a Secure Enclave or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on your device. The Secure Enclave and TPM are hardware-isolated, preventing even your operating system from directly accessing them. Instead, you use a special authentication API to make calls. There is no direct memory access to these keys unless an exploit is discovered. Think of a Secure Enclave and Trusted Platform Modules as a little, isolated computer inside your device -- because that's what they are! They have their own processor and operating system, and they are completely isolated from the rest of the device. They only release signatures and never release secrets (and aren't even capable of doing so, under normal cases). The device can only talk to the Secure Enclave/TPM via special authentication APIs. Synced Passkeys: Synced Passkeys store the private key in encrypted form within a password manager or platform keychain (like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or 1Password. These passkeys are designed to be backed up and synchronized across your devices for convenience. While the keys are encrypted during storage and transit, they're not permanently bound to a single hardware chip. This makes them more flexible and user-friendly, though they rely on the security of your account and the encryption used by the syncing service rather than hardware isolation. Here's how the flow works as I understand it: 1. You visit a website and try to login. 2. The server sends a randomized challenge string. 3. Your device's authenticator signs that challenge using the private key. 4. That signature gets sent back to the server. 5. The server verifies the signature using the public key it has on file. Why Passkeys are cool: - No shared secrets, so there's nothing on the server that's useful to steal. - They're phishing resistant, the browser or whatever ensures the origin matches before allowing auth. - No replay attacks because the server issues a new randomized challenge string every time. - No cred stuffing because each passkey is unique to the service it's generated for. This should all be correct to the best of my unexpert knowledge. --- Edit: Corrected some serious errors and forgot to explain device-bound vs. synced passkeys -- a major oversight! Disclaimer: Yes, I'm a human and I use --. This comment is self-written but I did use AI for grammar correction. reply",

Web server can ask a certificate from your web browser to validate your identity. So both ends know that the other is legitimate. Now the question is where to store that certificate? As a file on disk? Seems like bad idea - too easy to steal. Instead of that we can store them in dedicated hardware like yubikeys or tpm module. And the great thing is they are resistent to phishing because certificates use mathematics and can not be fooled by wrong url in browser address bar. So generally passkeys are just authentication using certificates.

          "text": "I'm still refining and working on my coding agent, VT Code. Two weeks ago, I posted a comment [0] to regular Ask HN: What are you doing this week? and got out-of my expectation feedback. Thank you HN community! The last 2 weeks I have been making constants and regular update to VT Code, and it still evolving to a hopefully more capable coding agent. Most recent notable release is official VS Code extension and OpenVSX distribution [1][2] so that you can use VT Code agent inside your favorite code IDE like VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, Kiro and Eclipse. About VT Code, it is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code intelligence via Tree-sitter (parsers for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java) and ast-grep (structural pattern matching and refactoring). It supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax; all with automatic failover, prompt caching, and token-efficient context management. Configuration occurs entirely through vtcode.toml, sourcing constants from vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs and model IDs from docs/models.json to ensure reproducibility and avoid hardcoding. [3] Recently I've added Agent Client Protocol (ACP) integration. VT Code is now a fully compatible ACP agent, works with any ACP-clients: Zed (first-class support), Neovim, marimo notebook.

          "text": "This weekend a VIP forgot their VPN password, tried to log in 50+ times, and got their home IP permanently blocked by the anti bruteforce setting on their firewall. Their helpdesk got confused and escalated, then their network team, who knew their internet wasnt down, escalated it as a massive emergency internet down. PRTG was clear on both sides that it wasnt down. To make it even more confusing, a totally separate unrelated major peering link actually went down at the same time for the ISP, so ISP helpdesk assumed it was related. It wasnt. When that peering came back, the problem was still occurring, but it escalates up the chain for the major internet outage that both sides of the networking teams agreed wasnt happening. The root cause, besides forgotten password and failing >50 times was just that our security policy doesn't auto-expire the IP block. Something the firewall doesnt let you configure. About a month prior to this, they had hackers hitting the remote vpn trying to brute force in, resulting in AD locking out many accounts, since the firewall didnt block. I recommended to implement brute forcing protection but to set the # high so as to avoid real users from getting blocked. But this 'major internet outage' that only affected 1 person on their home network is my fault. So yesterday I started building a flask app that can manage the block list. reply",

          "text": "This is something that an LLM can answer thoroughly. The problem is that we don't know the scope of the project. For example what does it mean to _secure the server properly_. What's the \"threat model\"? Are there compliance requirements? Since this looks like a sort of hobby-project (single-server production deployment?), I believe that you should be okay with ssh keys-only config and ports 80 (redirect to SSL) and port 443 with LE certificates. Managing security updates on a single server will require downtime. If you have active users you can handle that we scheduled downtime 5hours every X weeks (e.g. First Saturday of the month from 01-02 AM the server will be unavailable). You're going to need a dedicated system to setup observability. The cheapest option is probably node_exporter with prometheus and grafana. Loki for logs with s3 backend (can be pretty cheap if you use backblaze). For backups use whatever the provider gives you to backup the VM. Most providers have a ready-made solution for that. Automatic deploys can be configured ofc, but usually the deployment pipeline mirrors the application requirements... Are you going to a DVCS (github actions)? Are you doing to handle deployments using a tool like kamal? In either case would try to use \"SO_REUSEADDR\" for zero-downtime upgrades in a single-server. Secrets management and server setup can be managed by ansible + sops. > anything else that is needed? A DB? A CDN? An object store? A queue? :-) reply",

          "text": "I've been here. Taking a vacation never helped, because I'd be stressed during the vacation thinking about \"work\" in an active manner. What really helped me was fully disconnecting and shifting my mindset to think about work passively: I don't forbid myself from thinking about my work, but I do not action on it. Instead, I keep a physical scratchpad and write ideas and thoughts down continuously. This helps me refactor my perspective and shift it from \"active building\" to \"passive expansion\". I've come to realize burnout is a function of expectation mismatch, and I think of it from thermodynamics perspective. Burnout operates like a pressure differential system where the gap between internal expectations and external reality creates unsustainable energy expenditure. In a closed system, energy imbalance leads to heat loss or system failure. Similarly, when your mental model of \"what should be happening\" constantly fights against \"what is happening,\" you're burning cognitive energy just to maintain equilibrium. The passive approach allows me to transform that pressure into potential energy. Instead of forcing immediate resolution (active building), you're allowing ideas to exist in a low-energy state (passive expansion). This mirrors how heat dissipates naturally rather than through forced cooling - it becomes a capacitor, storing energy for later use rather than demanding immediate conversion. So the answer, for me, is \"disconnect from doing while staying connected to thinking\". This helps me recover much more efficiently, while keeping myself sharp and free of expectations of doing anything. reply",

When I need a break or a win, I pivot over to that project to do something fun and easy, which gives me a quick win and my sense of control back. It does have its limits. I feel like I’ve been burnt out for several years now. But was diagnosed with autism last year, so I think it’s autistic burnout, which would be separate from the technical burnout.

If you can't do that, the next best thing, or maybe even better, is to slow down enough to fix that one thing like you haven't had time to do earlier. For that you do really have to slow down, so what would have been more work before is very approachable, but the clear goal is the satisfaction once the worst annoyance is behind you, hopefully for good. You may still be doing technical work, but on the whole your tech/non-tech balance can lean strongly toward the non-tech goal of reduced annoyance & stressors, and that's where progress should be maintained. One problem can be when tech goals are so overwhelming it actually requires halting all other efforts.  This can be essential to overcome some obstacles. But you can't do this forever. Or endlessly, which seems like forever, and you're not a wimp for when your strength crumbles at different times, for different reasons or in comparison to others.  Nobody can actually take it, and everybody is a different camel sometimes lugging large amounts of straw on their back more than others. Maybe what helps is attitude adjustment and building up a tolerance to things that most others would not, that might even be what it takes a lot of the times to accomplish things that others would not.

          "text": "From my experience and talking to other founders/engineers ... 1) It's good to analyze what's the source of the burn-out. In many instances, it's not exactly exhaustion per se, but lack of meaning in what they are doing beyond the money. There are acute stressors, like coming out of an intense sprint, and chronic stressors, like not knowing why you're even doing this. If you had fuck-you money, what would you be doing long-term instead? beyond take a vacation, buy a house, etc. 2) Learning to say no to things. Let go of \"hero\" mode. Good enough for now is good enough for now. Cut down on complexity to reduce cognitive load. Really assess which things you do are real and which are performative. 3) Better understand how work fits in your long term goals. Having worked in VC, a lot of advice for founders are very investor-centric. The core of the thinking is that some sort of exit will solve all your problems, and is worth grinding for. I see many founders become entrepreneurs to \"work for themselves\" and not be a corp wage-slave, just to become a VC grind-slave. Their health falters, their personal life implodes (divorce/breakups), and they've no genuine friendships (just business acquaintances). When they do get to a good financial exit, they're still miserable. Do try to make the company/product building process enjoyable too. Sometimes it means slowing down, smell the roses, think things through to avoid problems. Overall, the right advice is very situational. The most important part may be talking out loud to someone you trust about it. Sometimes just verbalizing it helps. reply",

Of course, I am assuming the name-to-ip association is under the control of the system's engineers to begin with, for every other use case DNS can and should still be used.<p>Why aren't cloud providers and FAANGs doing this already, where saving costs by eliminating things like DNS request traffic and CPU cycles is encouraged?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "In my opinion if there is no overlapping networks or the Infrastructure as Code understands pods, k8's and such then /etc/hosts can speed up resolution leaving things outside of the data-center to utilize DNS then it makes sense but requires some critical thinking about how all the inter-dependencies in the data-center play together and how fail-overs are handled. Why aren't cloud providers and FAANGs doing this already This probably requires that anyone touching the Infrastructure as Code are all critical thinkers and fully understand the implications of mapping applications to hosts including but not limited to applications having their own load balancing mechanisms, fail-over IP addresses, application state and ARP timeouts, broadcast and multicast discovery.  It can be done but I would expect large companies to avoid this potential complexity trap.  It might work fine in smaller companies that have only senior/principal engineers.  Using /etc/hosts for boot-strapping critical infrastructure nodes required for dynamic DNS updates could still make sense in some cases.  Point being, this gets really complex and whatever is managing the Infrastructure as Code would have to fully aware of every level of abstraction, NAT's, SNAT's, hair-pin routes, load balanced virtual servers and origin nodes.  Some companies are so big and complex that one human can not know the whole thing so everyone's silo knowledge has to be merged into this Inf as Code beast.  Recursive DNS on the other hand only has to know the correct up-stream resolvers to use or if they are supposed to talk directly to the root DNS servers.  This simplifies the layers upon layers of abstraction that manage their own application mapping and DNS. Another complexity trap people get lured into is split-views which should be avoided due to growing into a complexity trap over time and breaking sites when one dependency starts to interfere with another.  Everyone has to learn the hard way for themselves on this topic. My preference would be to instead make DNS more resilient.  Running Unbound [1] on every node pointing to a group of edge DNS resolvers for external IP addresses with customized settings to retry and keep state up the fastest upstream resolving DNS nodes, also caching infrastructure addresses and their state, setting realistic min/max DNS TTL times is a small step in the right direction.  Dev/QA environments should also enable query logging to a tmpfs mount to help debug application misconfigurations and spot less than optimal uses of DNS within the infrastructure and application settings before anything gets to staging or production.  Grab statistical data from Unbound on every node and ingest it into some form of big-data/AI web interface so questions about resolution, timing, errors may potentially be analyzed. This is just my two cents based on my experience.  If it seems like I was just spewing words I was watching Shane Gillis and did not want to turn it off.

          "text": "Thanks for the well thought response friend :) You made some really good points. But here is my follow up: With /etc/hosts, there is no need to complicate things, for example: 10.0.0.1  sql.app.local storage.local lb.corp.net This line could be present on every host on every network, everywhere. The only thing that should matter in my opinion is that the name portion needs to be very specific. Even if you have NAT, SNAT, etc..., /etc/hosts is only relevant to the host attempting to resolve a name, it already knows what name to use. So long as you have one big-and-flat /etc/hosts everywhere, you just have to make sure that whenever you change an IP for a service, the global /etc/hosts reflects that change. and of course the whole devops tests, reviews,etc... ensure you don't screw that up. Back in the day, this was a really bad idea because the problem of managing /etc/hosts at scale wasn't solved. But it is just a configuration file for which IaC is best-suited. DNS on the other hand is a complex system that has hierarchies, zones, different record types, aliases, TTLs, caches, and more. in a closed private network, is DNS really worth it when you have already invested in IaC? reply",

In my experience teams and orgs want to have control over their thing and while they could logically all share commit access to a big flat thing it will start to introduce artificial problems. I could be wrong.  Perhaps in your company it will work out just fine.  As nobody here on HN knows the logical and physical structure of your company maybe pull a meeting together consisting of leaders from each team/org that currently influence DNS records and ask them to pick apart your idea after documenting it in a way everyone can visually understand how the code repositories and multi-department git permissions would be laid out and how each team would be able to independently add, change and delete records whenever they need to and review audit logs both in the repositories and possibly on each node.  My views could be skewed by all the politics that naturally occur as organizations grow.

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Next, you'll probably get a bunch of advice about leaving immediately, how you don't have to put up with this nonsense, and so on. I consider this advice well-meaning, but it might not take into account the complicated web of constraints that you face, so I recommend interpreting \"You should get out there now!\" as something more like a supportive \"You don't deserve to live like this!\" True, but not necessarily enough on its own to formulate a plan to address your quandary. In response to your final paragraph especially, it sounds like you need to have a real, frank conversation with someone who can help you navigate this situation. One in which you can get into the complex details of the situation and balance all your competing needs and desires. I say this because, sadly, you will not be able to solve this problem by running away from it, because it will find you again and you'll be even more tired and even less interested in dealing with it. You probably need more than \"Get out and take your people with you\". If you'd like to try to have this conversation, then I think I can help. You can start with my handle here, search the web, find out more about me (to judge for yourself whether I might be able to help you or I'm full of shit), and then contact me. If you think we might click, then ask me for help. Ignore anything that you see along the way that looks like a price. Meantime, any advice I can offer will sound like a platitude, so I won't bother. The reality of the situation is much more complex than that. Instead, think about what you'd like to have happen and maybe we can figure out how to make it happen. Peace. reply",

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

And his manager should be coaching this directly. As the EM, you want your whole team to be able to confidently do what he does. Functioning teams have multiple engineers concurrently owning your scope. If your company isn't toxic, over-working would also be seen as a negative because of the precedent it sets.

I feel like he depends on me for a lot, and since I don't have a clear answer for him in this situation since I'm actually involved in it, I think he doesn't know what to do. He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed. It's really difficult since it can all be covered up as just doing work and participating in the team -- that's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior like this. reply",

This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand. It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. It's easy to say \"don't condescend to your teammates\".

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.).

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

Give him important jobs etc. It's easier after you go for drink/coffee and become a bit more chill with each other.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it.

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

He is in disagreement with the hierarchy, uses disagreement to show defiance because he wants to be the leader. He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...). Which kinda shows that your manager does not agree with your viewpoint. If you take his words at face value, he is pretty much telling you that you are the problem. Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

And he sees the team lead as part of the problem. Do you think there is an alternative explanation besides the manager not believing in the leadership qualities of OP?

I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities. Maybe they like him because he is a nice person or because his lack of leadership gets them something they want. reply",

I am saying this because I want to tell OP how his situation sounds to a complete outsider. OP was there if the 9 guys all immediately stood up for him and told the other guy that he was clearly in the wrong, then this obviously disproves everything I said and OP knows that I am wrong.

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

What does the rest of the team do when you get challenged? Do they stand up for you and defend your decision and your right to make the decision? You brought up the post mortem. That was your decision to make, not only did you get challenged, but you also had to bring in your manager. What did the rest of the Team do? I have a hard time imagining a scenario, where you make a decision, where everyone but one guy goes against you and you still need a manager involved. >This is incorrect. They actively seek guidance from me regularly. As I mention in another post, three engineers joined the team specifically to work with me. I don't have doubts about this. I don't doubt any of that. And they may very well respect you, but that does not automatically translate into them respecting you as a leader . >What's the point? I gave you an outsiders perspective. Even if I am wrong about everything, the one thing I am absolutely certain about is that this one engineer sees you as a failure in leadership. And if he sees you as a failure in leadership (and has at least some positive opinions about his teammates, if he doesn't you are in far deeper trouble with him) then he must believe that the rest of your team does not believe in your leadership either. If I am wrong and the rest of the team stands firmly behind you, then you only need to show him that. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

          "text": "| Have you (or higher ups) pointed out his immaturity and behavior are likely the exact reasons he wasn’t selected to lead the team, and if he continues on this path he is ensuring he will never advance at the company? That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

Left corporate to build a scheduling tool (think Calendly alternative) that's launching on Product Hunt soon. A few observations from this journey: 1. The hardest part isn't building—it's finding the discipline to ship something \"good enough\" rather than perfect. Corporate trained me to over-polish. 2. Distribution is BRUTAL. You can build something genuinely useful, but without an audience or marketing chops, you're shouting into the void. I'm learning this the hard way. 3. The skillset mismatch is real. Big tech teaches you to work within massive systems with established users. Indie building is the opposite—you're creating systems AND finding users simultaneously. For those considering this: Start building in public NOW. The audience you build while employed becomes your launchpad when you go solo. Curious—for those who've done Product Hunt launches: what actually worked for you? I'm seeing so much conflicting advice about timing, pre-launch strategies, etc. reply",

Maybe something like https://smallbets.com is better than Product Hunt in finding that group of people. PH doesn't allow signups with only a username/email and password. I'm starting to believe a different community is needed for building in public that isn't HN or PH though it might be smallbets, I didn't try it. It worked for me to be highly uncompromising on what I want to have while at the same time highly accommodating to what people want. Also to indulge in things I like that others don't. Another thing that worked in the past is to have a mobile app because it gets you users simply because the app store puts it in front of people. What didn't work is emailing people asking for feedback. People mostly don't care. I want a showhn.com where builders commit to try each other's stuff. reply",

          "text": "I don't think you can tackle this purely from a hardware side. If you want to send input from the laptop to another system, there's no kind of USB profile available to collect input from a system. You're going to need software on the laptop to gather the input. That seems necessary. You're not going to invent a purely hardware based solution here. Given that, I'd abandon your starting requirement of needing two usb device ports. That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

          "text": "I'd still 100% recommend using ethernet, with two usb<->ethernet adapters on each end and a cable in-between to direct link the two. It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

Is there any kind of existing IPMI/ILO/etc functionality in the target machine that you could use? If not: You need something that can act as a usb \"device\" (the \"host\" and \"device\" sides of a usb connection are very different). A search for \"usb keyboard emulator\" turns up a lot of projects in that area. I'm not sure you're going to get much simpler than a pi-zero or teensy, unless you can find someone selling a pre built device that meets your needs. If you're lucky, your laptop has a usb port that can be configured to take the \"device\" role instead of the usual \"host\" role. In that case you could probably build a software-only solution using the Linux usb \"gadget\" framework to make that port act like a keyboard when attached to the target's usb port. reply",

However after 25 years I was still shooting myself in the foot on the regular. I evaluate Go, Rust and fpc. I'm too dumb for Rust, Go's was close but lack of exceptions and classes made it not for me. Fpc hit the sweet spot. The syntax is a little clunky but I have classes when I need them, exception handling, memory management - both auto and manual and cross platform support. Plus I can fit in my head - unlike C++</div>",

          "text": "FP is an interesting language. In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

It's kind of 2-in-1 language, but the ecosystem is primarily focused on the high level part, so you can only depend on small portion of it.

          "text": "I sometimes still code with a local LLM but can't imagine doing it on a laptop. I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

One methodology I've seen used with installed apps is major upgrades require a financial renewal but those can be spaced out every couple years. I love it when I find an iOS app that is paid, without ads, without in-app purchases. You just need to plan how that business model works and know that you won't have recurring revenue. Maybe that means you build companion apps, offer an optional subscription tier (often its cloud storage/device sharing based) or something like that. I've thought of doing a subscription like service but its use case is more of a once-in-a-while style so an option there would be pay-per use instead of a subscription. reply",

Just look up articles about how SaaS are slowly disappearing and how entrepreneurs should avoid creating SaaS if possible. People usually prefer one-time payments over monthly payments. There are exceptions, usually when the program/service is very valuable and expensive, it makes more sense to just pay for what you use, but in general single payment will always win. Also it depends whether we're talking local or remote service as remote service has inherent cost and having a single payment is not compatible with it. Additionally, there is a distinction between single and ongoing payment in the context of usability. Specifically, it makes little sense to sell a calculator program via a subscription fee but you also reach a limit of the possible customer base. Just like mobile applications. With subscription, you can keep milking the same customer for money indefinitely, but in such case you have to keep providing some services that is worth the payment. reply",

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...).<p>I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or \"score points\" against me all day and without expecting conflict every time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and culture.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff?

I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed.

Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well.

          "text": "Some toxic people can be good at provocation, victimization and distorting situations. An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

Give him important jobs etc. It's easier after you go for drink/coffee and become a bit more chill with each other.

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

          "text": "From what I've read in this thread, you don't have a ton of power with regards to meaningfully dealing with this guy. As far as I can tell, your only real course of action is to learn to live with him. I've worked with many people like this. Personally, I've always landed with curt, minimal responses, such as: - Them: says mean/passive-aggressive thing - Me: \"Noted, thanks.\" And then I move onto the next thing. It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.” - Marcus Aurelius, \"Meditations\" reply",

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

In response to your final paragraph especially, it sounds like you need to have a real, frank conversation with someone who can help you navigate this situation. One in which you can get into the complex details of the situation and balance all your competing needs and desires. I say this because, sadly, you will not be able to solve this problem by running away from it, because it will find you again and you'll be even more tired and even less interested in dealing with it. You probably need more than \"Get out and take your people with you\". If you'd like to try to have this conversation, then I think I can help. You can start with my handle here, search the web, find out more about me (to judge for yourself whether I might be able to help you or I'm full of shit), and then contact me. If you think we might click, then ask me for help. Ignore anything that you see along the way that looks like a price. Meantime, any advice I can offer will sound like a platitude, so I won't bother. The reality of the situation is much more complex than that. Instead, think about what you'd like to have happen and maybe we can figure out how to make it happen. Peace. reply",

This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization.

Who does his reviews? Do you have input? Could you influence his removal or not?\nHe may be resentful that he is not running the team.\nAfter reviewing what levers you have, I’d consider meeting him in your office. Let him know you want to discuss some things. Let him know you will want to hear from him. Explain that it’s a challenge running the group, historically there have been issues even before you showed up. Point out that many skills are needed to run the group, and when he acts a certain way, it’s way harder for you and his is also demonstrating he is weak in these executive level skills. Then listen to him in his points. Discuss if relevant. Does he have points or is he a nut. Then, tell him you need to re-baseline expectations. Explain how things need to operate. Summarize the discussion in email and send it to him. Separately send a write up to your boss in the conversation. Again, this is not an attempt to throw him under the bus, just to get him aligned with direction.\nBut if the re-baseline of expectations fails, you can work to take more steps regarding his review.\nI wonder if your team does not have a good well defined engineering leader. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager, not me...). Which kinda shows that your manager does not agree with your viewpoint. If you take his words at face value, he is pretty much telling you that you are the problem. Again, I don't know what is really happening. But if I read between the lines the picture seems to be the following: You have a engineer in your team who thinks you are a looser and incompetent. This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant. If you take all of this together the picture becomes quite clear. Nobody respect your leadership. Your staff doesn't and your manager doesn't. reply",

I wrote it below. If you are the leader of 10 people, 9 of whom trust you and 1 constantly disagrees with you, you can still push through any decisions, because the 9 people will stand up for you and force the one guy to accept whatever you decide. Imagine having to go to your manager because one guy in your team of 10 does not want to do a post mortem. There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem. So why do you love working for a leader, but do not care at all when the leader gets criticised for something extremely reasonable. They do not like him because of his leadership abilities. Maybe they like him because he is a nice person or because his lack of leadership gets them something they want. reply",

That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

          "text": "Once my boss told me: “You can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do.” And this guy just don’t want to work well with you. Period. I learned one approach that sometimes works: Figure out what they want and give them what they want. But with the condition they change their behavior. From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it. Just make clear: this isn’t about finger-pointing, it’s about building a culture where problems lead to better systems. reply",

Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.]\nSo, that's why I advised to better understand what is going on. I've been a \"powerless\" team lead more than once, and if you are not doing reviews and if the \"manager\" is not actively involved in making the team better but using input to perform a review, then its really frustrating.  So, either he has the levers to fix the problem or he needs to go to his manager and figure out what levers there are to fix this. reply",

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness.

I wouldn't use /etc/hosts for something with those needs, but pushing a smallish file to 10,000 hosts in a minute is readily achievable if you need it. I don't have an estimate kf the number of ssh handshakes per second a typical client machine could do, but if you run 512 pushes in parallel, I bet you can get it pushed in way under a minute; assuming you have sufficient bandwidth I would avoid trying to do a differential update because the interactivity is too many round trips and you'll blow your time budget, but you could keep several known hashes and differential update from those and full push if no match). Up to you if you want to also run a command to reload the file, or if you'd rather kqueue/inotify/just a periodic poll for change. If you have frequent changes, you probably want to do a phone tree approach where you push to a few servers per location and those push to the local servers. And probably a way to do single name announcements. Or maybe something else. But, if your system communicates by server hostnames and your server hostnames don't change often and ips of active servers don't change often, using /etc/hosts for that can be pretty useful. Everytime you get new servers, you have to repush the hostfile, but it's really not a big deal; and it changes a dynamic dependency to a static one. You can even run monitors to confirm your servers aren't resolving each other and that they all have acceptable host files. (Late edit, composed while I lost connectivity) Also, if your scale is hundreds of thousands of hosts, it might get pretty nasty, but chances are you wouldn't resolve every name on every host, so something smarter is needed; which could be DNS or could be selective pushing or could be some other dynamic system that's not entirely DNS. reply",

          "text": "In my opinion if there is no overlapping networks or the Infrastructure as Code understands pods, k8's and such then /etc/hosts can speed up resolution leaving things outside of the data-center to utilize DNS then it makes sense but requires some critical thinking about how all the inter-dependencies in the data-center play together and how fail-overs are handled. Why aren't cloud providers and FAANGs doing this already This probably requires that anyone touching the Infrastructure as Code are all critical thinkers and fully understand the implications of mapping applications to hosts including but not limited to applications having their own load balancing mechanisms, fail-over IP addresses, application state and ARP timeouts, broadcast and multicast discovery.  It can be done but I would expect large companies to avoid this potential complexity trap.  It might work fine in smaller companies that have only senior/principal engineers.  Using /etc/hosts for boot-strapping critical infrastructure nodes required for dynamic DNS updates could still make sense in some cases.  Point being, this gets really complex and whatever is managing the Infrastructure as Code would have to fully aware of every level of abstraction, NAT's, SNAT's, hair-pin routes, load balanced virtual servers and origin nodes.  Some companies are so big and complex that one human can not know the whole thing so everyone's silo knowledge has to be merged into this Inf as Code beast.  Recursive DNS on the other hand only has to know the correct up-stream resolvers to use or if they are supposed to talk directly to the root DNS servers.  This simplifies the layers upon layers of abstraction that manage their own application mapping and DNS. Another complexity trap people get lured into is split-views which should be avoided due to growing into a complexity trap over time and breaking sites when one dependency starts to interfere with another.  Everyone has to learn the hard way for themselves on this topic. My preference would be to instead make DNS more resilient.  Running Unbound [1] on every node pointing to a group of edge DNS resolvers for external IP addresses with customized settings to retry and keep state up the fastest upstream resolving DNS nodes, also caching infrastructure addresses and their state, setting realistic min/max DNS TTL times is a small step in the right direction.  Dev/QA environments should also enable query logging to a tmpfs mount to help debug application misconfigurations and spot less than optimal uses of DNS within the infrastructure and application settings before anything gets to staging or production.  Grab statistical data from Unbound on every node and ingest it into some form of big-data/AI web interface so questions about resolution, timing, errors may potentially be analyzed. This is just my two cents based on my experience.  If it seems like I was just spewing words I was watching Shane Gillis and did not want to turn it off.

          "text": "Thanks for the well thought response friend :) You made some really good points. But here is my follow up: With /etc/hosts, there is no need to complicate things, for example: 10.0.0.1  sql.app.local storage.local lb.corp.net This line could be present on every host on every network, everywhere. The only thing that should matter in my opinion is that the name portion needs to be very specific. Even if you have NAT, SNAT, etc..., /etc/hosts is only relevant to the host attempting to resolve a name, it already knows what name to use. So long as you have one big-and-flat /etc/hosts everywhere, you just have to make sure that whenever you change an IP for a service, the global /etc/hosts reflects that change. and of course the whole devops tests, reviews,etc... ensure you don't screw that up. Back in the day, this was a really bad idea because the problem of managing /etc/hosts at scale wasn't solved. But it is just a configuration file for which IaC is best-suited. DNS on the other hand is a complex system that has hierarchies, zones, different record types, aliases, TTLs, caches, and more. in a closed private network, is DNS really worth it when you have already invested in IaC? reply",

In my experience teams and orgs want to have control over their thing and while they could logically all share commit access to a big flat thing it will start to introduce artificial problems. I could be wrong.  Perhaps in your company it will work out just fine.  As nobody here on HN knows the logical and physical structure of your company maybe pull a meeting together consisting of leaders from each team/org that currently influence DNS records and ask them to pick apart your idea after documenting it in a way everyone can visually understand how the code repositories and multi-department git permissions would be laid out and how each team would be able to independently add, change and delete records whenever they need to and review audit logs both in the repositories and possibly on each node.  My views could be skewed by all the politics that naturally occur as organizations grow.  For what it's worth I was in a company that had multi-data-center wide /etc/hosts and it was just dandy when the company was small.

          "text": "I don't think you can tackle this purely from a hardware side. If you want to send input from the laptop to another system, there's no kind of USB profile available to collect input from a system. You're going to need software on the laptop to gather the input. That seems necessary. You're not going to invent a purely hardware based solution here. Given that, I'd abandon your starting requirement of needing two usb device ports. That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

          "text": "I'd still 100% recommend using ethernet, with two usb<->ethernet adapters on each end and a cable in-between to direct link the two. It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

          "text": "You could do this with a couple of TI MSP-EXP430F5529LP boards (<$16 each from Digikey).  They include demo code with HID features.  I've used this platform extensively, but I never used the USB features for anything other than a JTAG interface for development.  I once recommended it to a friend with no embedded development experience, and he had his own custom \"mouse jiggler\" up and working in one day. https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments... Alternatively, the newer ESP32-S3 boards (<$6 each) have dual USB-C interfaces, so you could do it with only one (smaller) card instead of two.  Development might take longer though. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN4789XC If you want to allow a network connection between the two computers, you could load soft-KVM software on each, and go from there. https://goinglinux.com/open-source-cross-platform-kvm-softwa... reply",

A search for \"usb keyboard emulator\" turns up a lot of projects in that area. I'm not sure you're going to get much simpler than a pi-zero or teensy, unless you can find someone selling a pre built device that meets your needs. If you're lucky, your laptop has a usb port that can be configured to take the \"device\" role instead of the usual \"host\" role. In that case you could probably build a software-only solution using the Linux usb \"gadget\" framework to make that port act like a keyboard when attached to the target's usb port. reply",

(See the problem of inference / black swan problem, to start.) So no one knows for sure (in general or in your, or anyone else's, specific case). Best we can do is heuristics, rules of thumb, etc.: ancestral wisdom based on as much time and experience as possible. Included in those — and among the most useful and reliable — are tips, not for maximizing benefits/successes, but for avoiding almost certain misfortune and ruin. Hence: avoid harmful substances and behaviors (alcohol, drugs, gambling …); generally avoid/neutralize envy, greed, etc.; avoid killing; teach yourself contentment / how to live with life's basics / how to want what you have instead of trying to get what you want; keep an inner score card instead of a worldly, external one; care for the body; be charitable; beware tampering with complex natural systems (Chesterton's Fence); eschew superfluity; focus on process more than outcomes (what is in your control, not what is outside of it); etc. Take care of your downside risk, and then acquire free options / expose yourself to positive expected-value uncertainty. reply",

I havent read the bhagavad gita or the upanishads, but I should do so. The reality here is that there's a single uncaused God. Even the polytheistic Hindus believe there's only 1 uncaused God(Brahman). But this God is too complex for human understanding. The religions are all bad, very insufficient, explanations of the God with a cultural lens to help in that understanding. Your importance of your operating manual is to get you to the point that you live at peace with your neighbours and even your enemies. Life is too short to have enemies. Which is then complex about how to avoid ending up with enemies because cultural differences can be the break. Which is the importance of multiple religions. reply",

Left corporate to build a scheduling tool (think Calendly alternative) that's launching on Product Hunt soon. A few observations from this journey: 1. The hardest part isn't building—it's finding the discipline to ship something \"good enough\" rather than perfect. Corporate trained me to over-polish. 2. Distribution is BRUTAL. You can build something genuinely useful, but without an audience or marketing chops, you're shouting into the void. I'm learning this the hard way. 3. The skillset mismatch is real. Big tech teaches you to work within massive systems with established users. Indie building is the opposite—you're creating systems AND finding users simultaneously. For those considering this: Start building in public NOW. The audience you build while employed becomes your launchpad when you go solo. Curious—for those who've done Product Hunt launches: what actually worked for you? I'm seeing so much conflicting advice about timing, pre-launch strategies, etc. reply",

I'm starting to believe a different community is needed for building in public that isn't HN or PH though it might be smallbets, I didn't try it. It worked for me to be highly uncompromising on what I want to have while at the same time highly accommodating to what people want. Also to indulge in things I like that others don't. Another thing that worked in the past is to have a mobile app because it gets you users simply because the app store puts it in front of people. What didn't work is emailing people asking for feedback. People mostly don't care. I want a showhn.com where builders commit to try each other's stuff. reply",

I have a server that has GPUs and runs llama.cpp behind llama-swap (letting me switch between models quickly). The best local coding setup I've been able to do so far is using Aider with gpt-oss-120b. I guess you could get a Ryzen AI Max+ with 128GB RAM to try and do that locally but non-nVidia hardware is incredibly slow for coding usage since the prompts become very large and take exponentially longer but gpt-oss is a sparse model so maybe it won't be that bad. Also just to point it out, if you use OpenRouter with things like Aider or roocode or whatever you can also flag your account to only use providers with a zero-data retention policy if you are truly concerned about anyone training on your source code. GPT5 and Claude are infinitely better, faster and cheaper than anything I can do locally and I have a monster setup. reply",

I think people missed out on how great it was because a bunch of the runners botched their implementations at launch, and it wasn't until 2-3 weeks after launch that you could properly evaluate it, and once I could run the evaluations myself on my own tasks, it really became evident how much better it is. If you haven't tried it yet, or you tried it very early after the release, do yourself a favor and try it again with updated runners. reply",

And while the LLM is doing the prompt processing I write my instructions of what I want to have done. Usually the LLM is long finished with PP before I am finished with writing instructions. Due to KV caching the LLM then gives almost instantly the answer. reply",

If the sponsors aren't supplying him with all that hardware then, in my opinion, he is taking a significant risk in buying all of it out of pocket and hoping that the money he makes from YT covers it (which I am sure it does, several times over).  But there is no guarantee that the money he makes from YT will cover the costs, is the point I'm making. But, then again, he does use the hardware in other videos so the it isn't like he is banking on a single video to cover the costs. reply",

I don't know about you but I wouldn't want my brand new laptop / desktop to be heating up the entire time I'm coding with 0 cool off. If you go the Mac route, I recommend getting TG Pro, the default fan settings on the Mac are awful they don't kick in soon enough, TG Pro lets you make it a little more \"sensitive\" to those temperature shifts, its like $20 for TG Pro if I remember correctly, but worth it. I have a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip, and 24GB of RAM, I believe only 16 of it is usable by the models, so I can run the GPT OSS 20B model (iirc) but the smaller one. It can do a bit, but the context window fills up quickly, so I do find myself switching context windows often enough. I do wonder if a maxed out MacBook Pro would be able to run larger context windows, then I would easily be able to code all day with it offline. I do think Macs are phenomenal at running local LLMs if you get the right one. reply",

I get a steady stream of tokens, slightly slower than my reading pace, which I find is more than fast enough.  In fact I´d only replace with exact same, or maybe M2 + Asahi with enough RAM to run the bigger Qwen3 model. I saw qwen3-coder mentioned here.  I didnt know about that one.  Anyone got any thoughts on how that compares to qwen3?  Will it also fit in 32GB? I'm not interested in agents, or tool integration, and especially wont use anything cloud.  I like to own my env. and code top-to-bottom.  Having also switched to Kate and Fossil it feels like my perfect dev environment. Currently using an older Ollama, but will switch to llama.cpp now that ollama has pivoted away from offline only.  I got llama.cpp installed, but not sure how to reuse my models from ollama, I thought ollama was just a wrapper, but they seems to be different model formats?

After downloading the model weights you can disconnect from the internet and things should still work. It's all happening in your browser, locally. Of course ollama is preferable for your own dev environment. But ONNX and transformers.js is amazingly useful for edge deployment and easily sharing things with non-technical users.

All the software is implemented by myself, but I started out with basically calling out to llama.cpp, as it was the simplest and fastest option that let me integrate it into my own software without requiring a GUI. I use Codex and Claude Code from time to time to do some mindless work too, Codex hooked up to my local GPT-OSS-120b while Claude Code uses Sonnet. > What laptop hardware do you have (CPU, GPU/NPU, memory, whether discrete GPU or integrated, OS) and how it performs for your workflow? Desktop, Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB of RAM, RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM), performs very well and I can run most of the models I use daily all together, unless I want really large context then just GPT-OSS-120B + max context, ends up taking ~70GB of VRAM. > What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short). Almost anything and everything, but mostly coding. But then general questions, researching topics, troubleshooting issues with my local infrastructure, troubleshooting things happening in my other hobbies and a bunch of other stuff. As long as you give the local LLM access to a search tool (I use YaCy + my own adapter), local models works better for me than the hosted models, mainly because of the speed and I have better control over the inference. It does fall short on really complicated stuff. Right now I'm trying to do CUDA programming, creating a fused MoE kernel for inference in Rust, and it's a bit tricky as there are a lot of moving parts and I don't understand the subject 100%, and when you get to that point, it's a bit hit or miss. You really need to have a proper understanding of what you use the LLM for, otherwise it breaks down quickly. Divide and conquer as always helps a lot. reply",

I host Open WebUI on it and connect via https and wireguard to it, so i can use it as PWA on my phone. I love not needing to think about where my data goes. But i would like to allow parallel requests, so i need to tinker a bit more. Maybe llama-swap is enough. I just need to see how to deal with context length. My models stop or go into infinite loop after some messages. But then i often start a new chat. Lemonade-server runs with llama.cpp, vllm seems to be scaling better thoug, but is not so easy to set up. Unsloth GGUFs are great resource for models. Also for Strix Halo check out kyuz0 repositorIES! Also has image gen. I didnt try those yet. But the benchmarks are awesome! Lots to learn from.\nFramework forum can be useful, too. https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes Also nice: https://llm-tracker.info/ It links to some benchmark site with models by size. I prefer such resources, since it is quite easy to see which one fit in my RAM (even though i have this silly thumbrule Billion Token ≈ GB RAM). Btw. even a AMD HX 370 with non soldered RAM can get some nice t/s for smaller models. \nCan be helpful enough when disconnected from internet and you dont know how to style a svg :) Thanks for opening up this topic!

Knowing that, unless you have good reasons (and experimenting/playing around IS a good reason) - not many people would choose to actually base their everyday workflow on an all-local setup. It's sort of like doing all your work on an 80386. Can it be made to work? Probably. Are you going to learn a whole lot making it work? Without a doubt!

          "text": "> compelling >> motivation It's the only way to be sure it's not being trained on. Most people never come up with any truly novel ideas to code.  That's fine.  There's no point in those people not submitting their projects to LLM providers. This lack of creativity is so prevalent, that many people believe that it is not possible to come up with new ideas (variants: it's all been tried before; or: it would inevitably be tried by someone else anyway; or: people will copy anyway). Some people do come up with new stuff, though.  And (sometimes) they don't want to be trained on.  That is the main edge IMO, for running local models. In a word: competition. Note, this is distinct from fearing copying by humans (or agents) with LLMs at their disposal.  This is about not seeding patterns more directly into the code being trained on . Most people would say, forget that, just move fast and gain dominance.  And they might not be wrong.  Time may tell.  But the reason can still stand as a compelling motivation, at least theoretically. Tangential: IANAL, but I imagine there's some kind of parallel concept around code/concept \"property ownership\".  If you literally send your code to a 3P LLM, I'm guessing they have rights to it and some otherwise handwavy (quasi important) IP ownership might become suspect.  We are possibly in a post-IP world (for some decades now depending on who's talking), but not everybody agrees on that currently, AFAICT. reply",

Yes, it is, although I only have one friend who has such a device. I tend not to spend much time at their place. If someone I knew had a wearable that was analyzing/recording everything, and they refused to remove it, I'd minimize the amount of time I'd spend with them. > I’m genuinely curious where you draw the line. \"Drawing the line\" isn't really the way I'd put it. As you say, we're surrounded by surveillance devices and there's little I can do about it.

It was falling apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one difficult coworker.<p>Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three engineers joined specifically to work with me.<p>Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out bad.<p>It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.<p>It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.<p>I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the company.<p>My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer \"gets along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]\". He says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying. His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much.

(After attempting to address the issue. But my experience is that toxics are gonna toxic. Don’t coddle them.) If you’re willing to lightly scorch some bridges, talk to your skip-level manager. If that doesn’t work, or you don’t want to, your best option is to go work for a decent manager, either at the same company or another one. Life’s too short, and you’re not going to be able to fix the toxic employee. In other words, get someone who can help, or get out. Take your friends with you. reply",

The issue is that, most of his \"fixes\" are just rearranging deck chairs, increasing timeouts, decreasing timeouts, adding memory, upgrading random libraries, etc., and he's constantly operating in \"emergency mode\", trampling on other people's work and priorities to get his \"urgent\" stuff out the door. He also just sort of throws things at the wall - \"what if we change / disable X to fix this, would that break any client use cases?\"... well, I dunno buddy, you are the one proposing the change, you have access to the logs, you are the genius, why is it _my_ job to evaluate your stream of half-baked ideas to separate the wheat from the chaff? Ultimately, we co-exist, and I'd even say there are things to learn from him, i.e. being responsive is important and hugely valued. Over time, I've learnt not to get sucked into his urgent, half-baked proposals to save the world, I just say look, if you think that's a good idea, go for it, do it, but... you don't get to force it down everyone's throat and pretend there is consensus, I have my own, different priorities that I am not going to drop for you. reply",

          "text": "Great insight and advice I need to take - your description captures my current situation almost to a tee, better than I’ve been able to understand it for myself, so thank you. In addition to what you described, in my case this engineer quickly recognizes other highly-effective and/or important people, and aggressively tries to build that reputation by privately messaging and even privately demoing work where the recipient has some stake in the outcome. I would onboard him to a project, sharing all of my tools, key contacts and personal insights, e.g. “our manager Smith is hinting that there is a big customer interested in X capability, which I’ve discussed with their power user Wilson and product owner Flores informally in recent demos. I think we could use Y approach and want to start prototyping if we get the go-ahead” This engineer would start messaging Flores, Wilson and Smith privately and schedule calls about X excluding me and other core maintainers to push the thing forward, often proposing Y in his own words. This strategy worked wonders for him in terms of upward movement. He is a diligent and extremely responsive to important people. But the strong engineers from whom he has effectively stolen credit, or even the opportunity to have a seat at the table in critical early discussions, obviously resent it. His direct manager is lackadaisical and basically just gets bombarded by this engineer asking for frequent, long 1-1 calls where he shares “his” accomplishments and ideas. I’ve watched this play out in person (we are a remote-only team except for big project-related events) — his manager clearly trying to leave the event after it concluded, keys in hand and facing his car door, everyone else has said goodbye and given space, and this engineer keeps him there talking for no less than 10 more minutes. I’ve never met someone so comically ambitious and overzealous to be seen as the MVP He was promoted in record time, much to the frustration of stronger and more critical maintainers. I am baffled by the whole thing, and just laugh at this point. My most charitable interpretation of manager’s actions are that they do recognize the dynamic, and just don’t care because ultimately their job is slightly easier for the meantime. But if any 2+ of the critical core maintainers split in frustration, the whole thing will suffer, badly ETA: it seems to me that remote-only teams are particularly susceptible to this kind of thing getting out of hand, because the capacity for secret communication is immensely greater reply",

          "text": "I can see that talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, and proposing other peoples ideas could be grating for others. However, another way of looking at it is, that's just called \"taking initiative\". There's nothing to stop _anyone_ from talking directly to Flores, Wilson and Smith, go meet with them, take them out to lunch, make friends with them, etc. If people think that Y approach is good, and talk amongst themselves about it, but don't actually write it up, pitch it to the powers that be, \"sell\" it, etc., then people are going to do that for them. If Flores, Wilson and Smith are overwhelmed with one on one chats and meetings, then they'll probably push back and organize some group meetings and communications that everyone is in on. Conversely, if _nobody_ is doing that, then that leaves things wide open for _someone_ to do that, and that person is actually adding some value in doing so. The person I work with also has a habit of cornering people when they are leaving. If you him \"goodnight, see you tomorrow\" at 5:30p, and pick up a bag, he will somehow interpret that as an opportunity to broach a whole new topic, and tie you up for half an hour. He does it with senior people too, it can be interesting to watch... hard to say whether it is not picking up on the social cues, or just not caring... reply",

He's said in the past with respect to this engineer's conflict with a struggling engineer on the team -- publicly pointing out that engineer's mistakes and lack of progress -- that he was afraid to have this come up to our director's (his skip's) visibility to avoid making a bad impression. I can see talking to my skip, and overall I think it'll have a decent chance of him being receptive, and that he has a good amount of trust for me. I think my manager will be understanding about what I've done and why, but it'll put friction and distance between me and him -- so far he's been an incredible advocate for me in everything. Everything except this, which is exactly what I really need him for, since it's affecting my well-being. The hard part is pointing to specific behaviors that I'd like changed. It's really difficult since it can all be covered up as just doing work and participating in the team -- that's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior like this. reply",

          "text": "Based on what you’ve written, you owe it to your skip to have this conversation with him. This issue isn’t just affecting you, it’s affecting the whole team, and I guarantee it’s dragging down the performance of the team as a whole. (Team performance always jumps up after a toxic employee is removed, in my experience, no matter how brilliant or essential they seemed to be.) Your manager’s fear of looking bad to his boss reflects his inexperience. (Or a dysfunctional organization, but let’s hope that’s not true.) It’s your skip’s job to provide mentoring to a new manager, and to support him in creating a high-performing team, which includes guiding him through using the company’s performance management process to take care of underperforming employees like your toxic coworker. Since you have a good relationship with your skip, I think a frank conversation about the effect this person is having on the team will go well. You can also share that you’re worried about it blowing back on you, and your manager’s fear of looking bad. If your skip is smart, he’ll use that opportunity to take a more active hand in mentoring your manager without bringing your name into it. reply",

          "text": "I talked to my manager just now. He knows of some cases where engineers have had bad experiences with him, but not others. Some apparently just talk to me but don't raise it to our manager. He still knew he was a problematic engineer, but wasn't getting the same confirmation that I was getting. I gave him the names of two more engineers with recent experiences with the guy he can talk to, one within the team and one outside the team. I also gave the feedback to my manager that I don't think he's handled this well. I brought up that he's, each time, mentioned another excuse for the difficult engineer. He agreed, and apologized to me. He was sincere, and apologized more than once.  Meanwhile, I apologized for bringing this up again. It's discouraging that he didn't have as many other people talking about the guy to him as they have to me. It makes me think I may just have way more problems with him than me, and that I've overestimated how problematic he is; though I also think the other engineers who've complained about him to me are conflict-averse and wouldn't want to raise this to a manager who may pass it on to the difficult engineer. I was also disappointed that my manager said that he doesn't think it's personal, and that that's just how the difficult engineer is to everyone; it's clear to me that that's not the case since I'm living it first-hand. It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. It's easy to say \"don't condescend to your teammates\". It's hard to say what behaviors that entails. reply",

          "text": "It’s surprisingly common for managers to have no clue what’s going on in their teams. Doubly and triply so for skip-levels and higher. The reason is exactly what you’re seeing here: people will complain to each other, but not inform their manager. One of the essential but most difficult jobs of a manager is to create psychological safety: the ability for people to raise what’s really on their mind, and to do so with the people who can act on that information. I think you made the right call here. Telling your manager you were disappointed with their handling took courage, too. Now they can look into it further, starting with talking to the people you named. Maybe they were just going along with you, “oh yeah, that guy’s a real jerk.” Maybe (and more likely) they didn’t raise it themselves because they’re don’t have the senior mindset you do. If your manager asks them directly, they’ll probably get a reasonably honest answer, although it’ll likely be softened a bit. > It was also hard to get to a concrete, specific, actionable behavior change to request the difficult engineer to commit to. Oh yeah, that’s the hell of these things. You end up playing whack-a-mole, too, because HR wants something more concrete than “don’t be an asshole,” and it turns out you can follow the letter of a PIP while finding plenty of other ways to be an asshole. reply",

The post itself strikes me as either lifted directly from reddit (experienceddevs or another sub), but your advice is generally great for any reader curious about how to handle this type of problem employee. From the perspective of a line manager, your statement about not coddling and directly confronting the issue intuitively sound correct. If it's possible to address behavioral issues in this type of high-talent high-friction engineer, it actually doesn't hurt to bruise their ego a little--if anything, doing it respectfully means they listen, and value the feedback more than usual. Edit: also, took a look at your profile--couldn't tell, what type of org are you VP of eng at? (Private, equity-funded, late-stage, early stage, fintech, biotech, saas, etc.).

I could do it then. I still think it’s more likely than not that things will go sour, especially since the rest of the team will actually be there, and I’ll be letting him know a lot of the team has had issues with him. The rest of the team is extremely passive and conflict-averse. It’ll be awkward then. I can try a remote 1:1 since I think there are more ways to keep a cap on this. The very fact that I have to tiptoe around this makes me realize this guy is super volatile and angry. Even reducing our 1:1 cadence, which I did for all team members simply due to too much meeting load on me, led him to cancel them altogether. reply",

An attempt to improve things over a cup of coffee can be distorted as rumors, slander, harassment, intimidation, threats, etc. A person that reached adulthood while being toxic throughout their life is probably competent at it at this point. While you were focused in acquiring your skills, they were probably getting better at being toxic. So you are probably not prepared for a direct confrontation with a veteran sabotaging jerk. Do not play a game you have never practiced as the away team because you are probably not going to win. The more you have advanced your career, the more you have to lose while engaging someone. And in this case you have not much to win, against a person that has less than you to lose. Just using up your time and distracting you from your job is a win for a saboteur. Anything you say can be held against you, so unless you've talked to a workplace attorney better stay out of it. If the situation is affecting you psychologically then engaging the person can affect you even more. Seek therapy if that helps, or channel your frustration through physical activity. The best you can do is to limit your interactions to the professional level, and limit the topics to what he is working on. Everything else is your business and not his and you can seek additional collaboration at your discretion. reply",

          "text": "I think from what I've written, it could be possible to interpret this as the case. At least part of it's true -- I'm not nearly as experienced in some of the technologies this team uses as the other engineer who's been working on the team for a lot longer. I think I'm self-aware about what I know and what I don't, and defer to him in those cases. I do think that plays into why he doesn't seem to have much respect for me. But the cases where we have the most conflict aren't those in which I'm reviewed or questioned, but in which I'm reviewing or questioning something about the other engineer. As an example -- there was recently an incident that resulted in a global outage for three hours due to a bad code change. The root cause was related to his change, which enabled another change to break the code. Users had to report this to us -- we didn't have alerts. The impact would directly affect growth and revenue, but in ways we can't quantitatively determine. I said we should do a post-mortem, add an integration test that would prevent recurrence, and add an alert -- the other engineer vehemently pushed back, claiming that it was another team's fault, since the code was shared with them, and pushed for another action item that wouldn't improve our operational stance. The other engineer has never worked in an operationally excellent team, whereas I have -- any other engineer who has would see a post-mortem as obvious. I think the opposite that you describe is the case; the other engineer still sees himself as effectively 'the lead', and wants to prove it, so is vulnerable and sensitive to loss of status or criticism. Overall I don't think what you've described is actually the real story. Several engineers both on the team and off the team have had complaints about this engineer, and the same thing happened with the previous lead, who was much more experienced than either of us. One engineer was distressed enough that it really should've warranted going to HR, which I suggested to my manager, who didn't follow through out of fear of it reflecting poorly on him, which is really unfortunate. I was brought into the team exactly because my style of leadership isn't top-down, brusque, or imposing -- I made it clear from the start my intention wasn't to unseat the other engineer as 'lead', and deliberately tried to make a lot of space for him to have ownership and growth and put him back on the promotion track. You don't have to take my word about this, but the intention of my post is to get advice. My main goal isn't to solidify my performance or status -- I'm already comfortably trusted and performing well. My goal is not to come into work with a high risk of conflict and stress each week, and needing to contort myself to avoid this. What would your advice be if I am representing the truth? reply",

It's only exhausting if you let it be. I know that might feel dismissive to you, but really: it's all about how you frame it. Be no more angry with this guy for being a dick than you would with a dog for barking (it's in its nature) or a baby for crying (it's in its nature) or for the sky raining (it's in its nature). “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly...[I] have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind...and so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.

Another thing is: it's really difficult to point to specific cases that really are \"HR-worthy\". That's the nature of passive-aggressive behavior. His treatment of another engineer, who has since been fired for performance, early this year really did qualify for HR based on how distressed the other employee was. I think I may have to bring this up to my manager's manager, since my manager doesn't want to. It'll hurt my relationship with my manager, but I think this is feedback he really does need to hear and receive, or he'll just keep tolerating competent jerks on his teams. Several other employees have had issues with him. The sense I get is they're really just seeking peace at this point and it's clear they're avoiding him. Since he's been there since the beginning he knows a lot that no one else does, but they rarely approach him for help -- he's made it clear to me in early 1:1s he isn't interested in investing more time in trying to up-level his peers. He does have a good relationship with a junior engineer on the team, though, and may be developing a good one with another engineer that he probably has more respect for than me. reply",

I am rather a bit skeptical of this account as written. One hint: he was told he was meant to be the lead. That's a bit of a shitty promise to be given and taken away. This guy is almost certainly operating from a place of \"status injury.\" He sees you as the person who took his job. So, some hard questions for self-reflection: Knowing he felt slighted, did you ever try to build an alliance with him and acknowledge his expertise? Or did you just expect him to fall in line? Are you showing him respect, or just demanding it because of your title? Are his arguments over \"trivial things\" really trivial? Or is it his (unproductive) way of trying to assert the technical authority he feels you're ignoring? Right now, your manager hears a personal problem (\"This guy is a jerk to me\"). That's why he's giving you the weak \"don't let it bother you\" response. Stop making it personal. Use your leadership skills to actually lead this person. Try to fix the relationship. Give him ownership. If that fails, you can go to your manager with a leadership problem (\"I've tried A, B, and C to leverage his skills, but his behavior is still causing X business risk\"). That is a problem a manager has to solve. reply",

He also perceives he does not have much to lose by doing this because in the worst case scenario he will just go be an individual contributor elsewhere, and in the best case scenario you would leave, your role would be vacant and he may be eligible for it again. The first thing you will do, is to talk to individual people by name. Do not ask open questions that everyone can respond to, because he will use that opportunity to be toxic. If he does intervene in a toxic way, you will continue addressing the person you were talking to, by name, and not pursue his talking point. This is fair game because you were not talking to him. Secondly, instead of having long meetings with the entire team about every topic, you will have a general high level meeting with the team, and dedicated meetings for navigating the actual solutions with specific team members. You will not discuss solutions at length in the front of the entire team, and if you do, see the point above. You will also try to have clear agendas and expectations for meetings. Thirdly, if he wants to initiate a conversation, try to scope it to what he was working on. Until you mobilize him to work on something else or ask for his opinion, other initiatives are not his primary concern. You can ask \"tell me how the initiative X is going\", or \"what are your current priorities at the moment\" to frame the conversation, and steer the conversation so that it stays on topic. If he refuses to answer just say \"he will revisit your priorities later\" and talk to someone else. Lastly, if he operates outside the direction given by you as a lead, or consensus of the team, document it. And if it has consequences, document them. Create a clear paper trail that shows that he is not an individual contributor that can be mobilized towards a goal and is a liability for the organization. Until he fixes his attitude, never ask for his advice in terms of \"what would you in this situation if you were me\", but you may ask others this. reply",

          "text": "I'm the \"senior\" engineer in this situation (actually, senior staff -- the other engineer is 'senior', though titles in this company are inflated by ~1 relative to standards at FAANG). I'm the designated engineering leader, and the rest of the team very much likes working with me and respects me a lot -- three of our engineers joined the team citing wanting to to work with me specifically, including one engineer from a previous team of mine, an internal transfer, and an external hire. I think the problem is he simply rejects me as the designated engineering leader, because he recognizes he is more knowledgeable than me about a set of technologies he has more experience with than I do. I'm glad you brought this up, though: The only other person is the principal engineer, who I do think I have to continue to build a relationship with. That principal engineer worked very closely with the difficult engineer, and the difficult engineer has a lot of trust for the principal. The principal has a lot of trust for me, and supported my promotion to senior staff. He's certainly resentful he's not running the team. He was told really early on by our previous director wanted him to be the lead of this team, despite big gaps in experience. He made a big deal about \"officially\" abdicating his role as lead to me when I joined, which was a bit much -- I had no intention of replacing him, but just to get the team functioning and working and not trying to get each other fired. At that point I had been moved against my own will and wanted to keep the door open to me going back to my previous team, which was closer to my interests, in 6-12 months. I think he was put into a position of too much responsibility too soon, did a very good job on parts of it (the technical parts), and an awful part on other parts of it (the team leadership parts). I think the direct conversation you mean is one potentially effective way to handle this, but things blew up with the last lead too, who was much more brusque. If I'm not careful, and he sees this as \"pulling rank\", I can see things blowing up once again. reply",

This is why he second guesses you at every point, because he does not believe that you can make adequate decisions. At the same time other coworkers \"love working with you\", I am absolutely sure they do, but I guess that they have very little respect for you as a leader, they love working with you because it allows them to do what they want. The opinion of your boss towards the \"problem engineer\" seems quite positive, which also suggests that your manager does not consider your judgements of your teammates as particularly relevant.

There have to be 9 other guys who do not care at all about your decisions, else they would have immediately stood up for you, for something as reasonable as a post mortem.

          "text": "In the first instance, even if you’re right and the manager thinks team lead is the problem here, it’s quite the leap to go straight to “questions his leadership qualities” over a single interpersonal conflict or difference in viewpoint. It’s plausible, sure. But the manager could just as easily be trying to avoid (needed) conflict. To your second point, there’s MANY other explanations. We don’t know how the team reacted for a start - maybe they did back up OP. Or maybe, based on the alleged jerk’s aggressive behaviour to the team in the past, they felt scared to speak up. Or maybe they’re junior. Or maybe you’re right and all 9 people unanimously felt OP was in the wrong. My point wasn’t any of this though, it was mainly: avoid coming to such harsh judgments based on so much extrapolation. Criticise the reported actions, sure, discuss some hypotheticals, but going straight for “you’re a bad leader” goes a bit beyond. reply",

Workplace bullying is certainly more important than disagreeing and this would make a reasonable case to fire him. If the jerk was bullying his team and OP did not notice, that would prove my argument even more. >Or maybe they’re junior. There are 9 other people. And they weren't asked to stand up for their own opinion, but for their team leads opinion. I do not think this matters much. 9 people not standing up for you as a team lead is a very bad sign, even if they are all juniors. >Or maybe you’re right and all 9 people unanimously felt OP was in the wrong. This isn't my interpretation at all. My interpretation is that OP had one opinion the other guy had his and the rest did not particularly care either way. >Criticise the reported actions, sure, discuss some hypotheticals, but going straight for “you’re a bad leader” goes a bit beyond. But having to go through your manager to force through a totally reasonable decision that is yours to make is being a bad leader. I do not think that there is any alternative interpretation then that this event at least is a failure in leadership. I am saying this because I want to tell OP how his situation sounds to a complete outsider. OP was there if the 9 guys all immediately stood up for him and told the other guy that he was clearly in the wrong, then this obviously disproves everything I said and OP knows that I am wrong. But if they did not, then he should reconsider his actions and at least allow for the possibility that this was a failure on part of his leadership. reply",

          "text": "I think there are four pieces of evidence: - One person on the team does not respect him. That is pretty unambiguous. - His manager puts his own (in all likelihood, based on quite limited information) opinion about the one  guy over the opinion of the team lead. The team lead definitely knows the guy better, yet his manager disregards that. Why would he do that if he believed that the team lead was doing good leadership? Questioning the behavior of your subordinates is something you do when you don't trust in their abilities. - The post mortem. If you are the team lead and you want a post mortem, then you will do a post mortem. \"Because I say so\", should be enough of a reason. Yet somehow his own manager needed to get involved, to force through the decision of the team lead? This also relates to the point before this. - The Team. And I think this is the biggest tell. Imagine you are a team lead and you tell 10 people \"we are doing X\", one guy disagrees. There are still 9 other people, if they trusted the team lead as a leader, they would take his side, especially if X is something as obvious as doing a post mortem. This whole situation can only develop if the 9 people \"who like to work with him\" refuse to stand up for him at all. If you as a leader have 90% of the people behind you everything you say will be done. The real question is why the rest of the team is doing nothing. Either it is because they are more afraid to go against the one guy (unlikely) or because they do not think it is worth it to stand up for the team lead. The real thing OP should consider is why his team does not appear to care the tiniest bit about his leadership position. If they did, the one guy would not be a problem at all. One question remains, why do they love working with him. I do not think they are flattering him, I think they mean it. Often working for a weak leader is easy, because you can set your own rules and you can push your leader around. They probably enjoy that the atmosphere in the team is more relaxed, they get to have more influence on decisions and they can deflect work they do not want to do. reply",

One in which you can get into the complex details of the situation and balance all your competing needs and desires.

You probably need more than \"Get out and take your people with you\". If you'd like to try to have this conversation, then I think I can help. You can start with my handle here, search the web, find out more about me (to judge for yourself whether I might be able to help you or I'm full of shit), and then contact me. If you think we might click, then ask me for help. Ignore anything that you see along the way that looks like a price. Meantime, any advice I can offer will sound like a platitude, so I won't bother.

From your post, it sounds like this guy wants to be promoted. If I were you, I would talk to him like this: “Look, you are good technically. You should be promoted. But higher levels here mean more than just code. It means mentoring, working closer with peers, hiring people, training them, helping management. We have a career path in place, let’s make a plan for you.” In big companies it’s even easier. Use the promotion track. Show him what’s expected. If he wants the title, he has to play the role. Three things can happen: He rises to it: He starts acting more professional, helps others, builds trust. You win, he wins, team wins. He tries and fails: He’s exposed higher up. He has direct reports. He’s in meetings with management. He can’t hide his behavior anymore. Eventually, they’ll act. He says “no thanks”: Then it’s clear. He just wants to stay where he is and make your life harder. At least now everyone sees it. This puts the pressure where it belongs. On him, to live up to what he says he wants. [Edit]: You can also tell him that if he wants the promotion, he has to start acting like someone at that level. That means following the principle: “There are no mistakes, only lessons we learn from.” Tell him: \"There was an outage. OK. Then step up. Take the lead, organize a post-mortem, and work with others to find real measures that prevent it in the future. Not to assign blame, but to help the organization improve.\" Maybe you don’t even join the post-mortem, let him own it.

I would start by documenting every incident and every fuckup by this guy in detail with links to tickets, slack and commits related to problems he has caused. Meeting notes about his poor professionalism could be used against him. You need that evidence, once you have a pretty good book on him, 5-10 incidents, especially with production downtime or company revenue ramifications, and you will have a good base with which to PIP him. Make life as uncomfortable for him as possible while remaining professional. What’s the worst thing that happens, he quits?

That could do one of two things… get him to shift his attitude or find a new job where he can advance. This is currently my top option I'm considering. I'd like to deliver (or have my manager deliver) the feedback based on the leveling guidelines that include team leadership skills, and make it very unclear that this is the biggest blocker for his promotion, and unless he changes, he will not be promoted on the team. I'm eager to move that forward to end up solving this problem and moving it out of the current state, which is intolerable to me, but it's not review time. Next time I meet with my manager I want to float this idea to him. I personally can't get rid of him, and I know of at least one good engineer on the team who would be upset if he left, since he has a lot of historical knowledge about the stack no one else has -- no one on the team enjoyed working with him except for one junior engineer, so no one else has learned certain parts of the stack. About whether he's toxic: things really switch back and forth. More recently, he's mostly stopped working with everyone but a junior engineer who he does have a good relationship with. He is responsible and a strong owner for the thing he owns. He does a lot of generous, unglamorous work for the team, like clearing up tech debt -- though he doesn't commit to things on the roadmap that'll help move the stack forward, I think out of a fear of failure, since I think a lot of his behavior is partially explained by insecurity -- but that's another conversation. I think from his perspective, he would say that I'm not good enough to be the lead of this team, and he would be better at it than I am. In a couple dimensions (his historical knowledge/background, and his experience with the stack) he'd have a point, but still wrong overall, I think. But either way, whether he respects me or not, I am owed to be treated as if he respects me. That's part of being a professional and a good teammate, and he should owe that equally to anyone on the team -- he doesn't do a good job at hiding his disdain for other people on the team, or many people outside the team either; when we were a bit closer, near to when I joined the team, he badmouthed almost everyone he currently works with, or has worked with. reply",

If he is the only one he knows the stack, and he isn’t personable enough to work with for a hand off (for most of the team), he had stuck himself in that role. Some people think if only they can do a certain job it means security, but what it really means is they can never be promoted. If he wants to move up he needs to show that is can successfully work with people and have everything off, so he isn’t a single point of failure. Being a lead is also more than hard skills, it’s soft skills and being able to work with people, which sounds like a weakness. If he is serious about wanting to move up, there are lots of things he needs to address here, not just his attitude towards you. reply",

One methodology I've seen used with installed apps is major upgrades require a financial renewal but those can be spaced out every couple years. I love it when I find an iOS app that is paid, without ads, without in-app purchases. You just need to plan how that business model works and know that you won't have recurring revenue. Maybe that means you build companion apps, offer an optional subscription tier (often its cloud storage/device sharing based) or something like that. I've thought of doing a subscription like service but its use case is more of a once-in-a-while style so an option there would be pay-per use instead of a subscription. reply",

Just look up articles about how SaaS are slowly disappearing and how entrepreneurs should avoid creating SaaS if possible. People usually prefer one-time payments over monthly payments. There are exceptions, usually when the program/service is very valuable and expensive, it makes more sense to just pay for what you use, but in general single payment will always win. Also it depends whether we're talking local or remote service as remote service has inherent cost and having a single payment is not compatible with it. Additionally, there is a distinction between single and ongoing payment in the context of usability. Specifically, it makes little sense to sell a calculator program via a subscription fee but you also reach a limit of the possible customer base. Just like mobile applications. With subscription, you can keep milking the same customer for money indefinitely, but in such case you have to keep providing some services that is worth the payment. reply",

          "text": "> /etc/hosts works until you need to change an IP across 10,000 servers in under a minute. I wouldn't use /etc/hosts for something with those needs, but pushing a smallish file to 10,000 hosts in a minute is readily achievable if you need it. I don't have an estimate kf the number of ssh handshakes per second a typical client machine could do, but if you run 512 pushes in parallel, I bet you can get it pushed in way under a minute; assuming you have sufficient bandwidth I would avoid trying to do a differential update because the interactivity is too many round trips and you'll blow your time budget, but you could keep several known hashes and differential update from those and full push if no match). Up to you if you want to also run a command to reload the file, or if you'd rather kqueue/inotify/just a periodic poll for change. If you have frequent changes, you probably want to do a phone tree approach where you push to a few servers per location and those push to the local servers. And probably a way to do single name announcements. Or maybe something else. But, if your system communicates by server hostnames and your server hostnames don't change often and ips of active servers don't change often, using /etc/hosts for that can be pretty useful. Everytime you get new servers, you have to repush the hostfile, but it's really not a big deal; and it changes a dynamic dependency to a static one. You can even run monitors to confirm your servers aren't resolving each other and that they all have acceptable host files. (Late edit, composed while I lost connectivity) Also, if your scale is hundreds of thousands of hosts, it might get pretty nasty, but chances are you wouldn't resolve every name on every host, so something smarter is needed; which could be DNS or could be selective pushing or could be some other dynamic system that's not entirely DNS. reply",

          "text": "In my opinion if there is no overlapping networks or the Infrastructure as Code understands pods, k8's and such then /etc/hosts can speed up resolution leaving things outside of the data-center to utilize DNS then it makes sense but requires some critical thinking about how all the inter-dependencies in the data-center play together and how fail-overs are handled. Why aren't cloud providers and FAANGs doing this already This probably requires that anyone touching the Infrastructure as Code are all critical thinkers and fully understand the implications of mapping applications to hosts including but not limited to applications having their own load balancing mechanisms, fail-over IP addresses, application state and ARP timeouts, broadcast and multicast discovery.  It can be done but I would expect large companies to avoid this potential complexity trap.  It might work fine in smaller companies that have only senior/principal engineers.  Using /etc/hosts for boot-strapping critical infrastructure nodes required for dynamic DNS updates could still make sense in some cases.  Point being, this gets really complex and whatever is managing the Infrastructure as Code would have to fully aware of every level of abstraction, NAT's, SNAT's, hair-pin routes, load balanced virtual servers and origin nodes.  Some companies are so big and complex that one human can not know the whole thing so everyone's silo knowledge has to be merged into this Inf as Code beast.  Recursive DNS on the other hand only has to know the correct up-stream resolvers to use or if they are supposed to talk directly to the root DNS servers.  This simplifies the layers upon layers of abstraction that manage their own application mapping and DNS. Another complexity trap people get lured into is split-views which should be avoided due to growing into a complexity trap over time and breaking sites when one dependency starts to interfere with another.  Everyone has to learn the hard way for themselves on this topic. My preference would be to instead make DNS more resilient.  Running Unbound [1] on every node pointing to a group of edge DNS resolvers for external IP addresses with customized settings to retry and keep state up the fastest upstream resolving DNS nodes, also caching infrastructure addresses and their state, setting realistic min/max DNS TTL times is a small step in the right direction.  Dev/QA environments should also enable query logging to a tmpfs mount to help debug application misconfigurations and spot less than optimal uses of DNS within the infrastructure and application settings before anything gets to staging or production.  Grab statistical data from Unbound on every node and ingest it into some form of big-data/AI web interface so questions about resolution, timing, errors may potentially be analyzed. This is just my two cents based on my experience.  If it seems like I was just spewing words I was watching Shane Gillis and did not want to turn it off.

          "text": "Thanks for the well thought response friend :) You made some really good points. But here is my follow up: With /etc/hosts, there is no need to complicate things, for example: 10.0.0.1  sql.app.local storage.local lb.corp.net This line could be present on every host on every network, everywhere. The only thing that should matter in my opinion is that the name portion needs to be very specific. Even if you have NAT, SNAT, etc..., /etc/hosts is only relevant to the host attempting to resolve a name, it already knows what name to use. So long as you have one big-and-flat /etc/hosts everywhere, you just have to make sure that whenever you change an IP for a service, the global /etc/hosts reflects that change. and of course the whole devops tests, reviews,etc... ensure you don't screw that up. Back in the day, this was a really bad idea because the problem of managing /etc/hosts at scale wasn't solved. But it is just a configuration file for which IaC is best-suited. DNS on the other hand is a complex system that has hierarchies, zones, different record types, aliases, TTLs, caches, and more. in a closed private network, is DNS really worth it when you have already invested in IaC? reply",

In my experience teams and orgs want to have control over their thing and while they could logically all share commit access to a big flat thing it will start to introduce artificial problems. I could be wrong.  Perhaps in your company it will work out just fine.  As nobody here on HN knows the logical and physical structure of your company maybe pull a meeting together consisting of leaders from each team/org that currently influence DNS records and ask them to pick apart your idea after documenting it in a way everyone can visually understand how the code repositories and multi-department git permissions would be laid out and how each team would be able to independently add, change and delete records whenever they need to and review audit logs both in the repositories and possibly on each node.  My views could be skewed by all the politics that naturally occur as organizations grow.  For what it's worth I was in a company that had multi-data-center wide /etc/hosts and it was just dandy when the company was small.

          "text": "I don't think you can tackle this purely from a hardware side. If you want to send input from the laptop to another system, there's no kind of USB profile available to collect input from a system. You're going to need software on the laptop to gather the input. That seems necessary. You're not going to invent a purely hardware based solution here. Given that, I'd abandon your starting requirement of needing two usb device ports. That doesn't seem to help you out here, doesn't actually buy you much. I'd look at the field of existing software out there that can ship input between systems. Use ethernet, wifi, or BT for connectivity if possible (perhaps via usb-ethernet adapters which are very cheap!), and if absolutely required you can build a little rpi-zero with a usb-gadget to act like a virtual keyboard. https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse https://github.com/lkundrak/btkbdd reply",

          "text": "I'd still 100% recommend using ethernet, with two usb<->ethernet adapters on each end and a cable in-between to direct link the two. It's the most standard easiest to acquire way to link two computers, and it doesn't require any other network to work. Using more bespoke hardware is only going to make this more difficult. Using usb<->serial would also be acceptable I suppose, and require a little less configuration effort, but adapting software to use this is going to be much harder when the existing software is so IP oriented. Whatever the case, having off the shelf connectivity seems like such a win, and I continue to dis-recommend building anything yourself: this is/ought be mostly a software problem. The one carve out I'd make: if you want to minimize the configuration at the target device, it ought be possible to make a rpi0 device that outputs a usb-gadget keyboard. Continue using one of these IP based software systems to send input to the rpi0, then usb-gadget it out to the target device. The btkbdd project also might be up your alley: if the target system has bluetooth or can have a (very cheap!) usb<->bluetooth adapter added, making the laptop just send a bluetooth HID to the other device is probably one of the lowest configuration most standard paths available for this work. reply",

I've used this platform extensively, but I never used the USB features for anything other than a JTAG interface for development.  I once recommended it to a friend with no embedded development experience, and he had his own custom \"mouse jiggler\" up and working in one day. https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments... Alternatively, the newer ESP32-S3 boards (<$6 each) have dual USB-C interfaces, so you could do it with only one (smaller) card instead of two.  Development might take longer though. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN4789XC If you want to allow a network connection between the two computers, you could load soft-KVM software on each, and go from there. https://goinglinux.com/open-source-cross-platform-kvm-softwa... reply",

I'm not sure you're going to get much simpler than a pi-zero or teensy, unless you can find someone selling a pre built device that meets your needs. If you're lucky, your laptop has a usb port that can be configured to take the \"device\" role instead of the usual \"host\" role. In that case you could probably build a software-only solution using the Linux usb \"gadget\" framework to make that port act like a keyboard when attached to the target's usb port. reply",

You have a server that you can’t ssh/vnc/rdp into, it has an open usb port, and using an $8 keyboard is a no-go? Edit: If you ignore all the hacking language, it kind of looks like an O.MG Plug might accomplish what you’re looking for. https://shop.hak5.org/products/omg-plug reply",

          "text": "Intuitively, connecting two computers over USB seems like it should be easy. The reason it is not simple is USB is asymmetric. There’s one host and multiple clients. And computers are approximately always built as hosts. But if you are going to add hardware, a pair of usb network adapters (wired (or wireless)) has the same architecture. And you won’t have custom software below the application layer. Good luck. reply",
