Imagine you, as a security researcher (or any other persona in the security field), wanted to see what prior works are available around bypassing v8 sandbox using webasm, or if what’s been done or found targeting deserialization in Go. Using this web app, you can search the indexed and tagged write ups. Also adding MCP support to it so your agents can search too. Hopefully going live soon. P.S: I said HN-like, but tbh it’s just the UI that looks a bit like HN (I’m not a good designer, so got heavy inspiration from HN listing style), otherwise there’s no other overlap in functionality yet. reply",

Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

          "text": "Here's an analysis of your codebase by Claude Opus 4.6 and Kimi 2.5 -- I don't code in Rust or GTK so I can't vouch for how spot on this is but I hope it's not too far off the mark and helps you improve your code. (Claude is wrapping both analyses together.) Strong agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  - Panicking error handling — both flag unwrap()/expect() on fallible operations (secrets, HTTP client, GStreamer). Kimi specifically calls out get_stream_uri returning String instead of Result, which I missed — good      \n  catch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  - Excessive cloning — both note the Jellyfin client and string cloning. Kimi's phrasing (\"host.to_string() on every request construction\") is more specific than mine.\n  - Application struct overloaded — both agree it holds too many responsibilities. Kimi suggests splitting into LibraryService, PlaybackService, etc. I focused more on the RefCell exposure.\n  - Silent error suppression — both flag let _ = sender.send(...) and unwrap_or_default() patterns.\n  - Code duplication in UI — both identify the repetitive list/detail/sorter patterns. Kimi specifically calls out call_on_visible_page widget comparisons, which I grouped under the broader \"5+ copies of factory setup\"\n  observation.\n  - Missing HTTP timeouts — Kimi flags this explicitly. I noted it indirectly via the buffer_unordered without timeout, but Kimi is clearer.\n\n  Things Kimi caught that I didn't emphasise\n\n  - get_stream_uri returning String instead of Result — a genuine API design issue I glossed over.\n  - String-based signal names being error-prone with no compile-time checking — fair point, though it's idiomatic GTK4/Rust.\n  - glycin potentially unused — I didn't check dependency usage.\n  - Position polling not accounting for seeks — a practical UX observation I missed.\n  - /proc/sys/kernel/hostname read being cached in OnceLock — Kimi approves the caching but notes it could be done once at startup. Minor but valid.\n\n  Things I caught that Kimi missed\n\n  - Actual bugs — queue reorder off-by-one, playlist DnD index error, toast format string \"HTTP {} error\" never substituted, double-wrapped Result in stream_info.rs, reversed comment in shuffle logic. These are concrete\n  defects, not just style issues.\n  - Concurrency issues in depth — the Cell<bool> shuffle state race, futures::Mutex inside glib::spawn_future_local deadlock risk, queue mutation race between remove_all() and extend_from_slice().\n  - Signal handler accumulation on widget reuse in ListView factories — a slow memory leak.\n  - Main-thread blocking from synchronous library filtering in detail views.\n  - Image cache with no eviction — unbounded disk growth.\n  - bytes_to_texture panicking inside a Result-returning function — defeats the entire error contract. reply",

You can graphically explore arguments, track their logical sufficiency/necessity, and make counterpoints. It's different than other types of argument theory that just have points \"in favor\" and \"against\" because of how it tries to propagate logical truth and provability. reply",

A while back I've switched to a more modern stack and have fully abandoned WordPress.

As a result, I started a service to help business owners break free from WordPress on to a more modern Next.js-powered stack that's faster, lighter weight, and easier for them to manage.

          "text": "I love making games, and I’ve been building a no-code game engine by extracting reusable components every time I ship a new game. It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform. Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.\nFor game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1]. Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2]. Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4. Nothing is locked in. The engine/editor is at https://craftmygame.com if anyone wants to poke around! And you can test a games here[3][4], and 1 multiplayer game I've tested IRL in a bar [4]!

          "text": "So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales). Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors. I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too. Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions! reply",

That said, if you're talking about models you can actually use on a single regular computer that costs less than a new home, the current crop of open models are very capable but also have noticeable limitations. Small models will always have limitations in terms of capability and especially knowledge. Improved training data and training regiment can squeeze out more from the same number of weights, but there is a limit. So with that in mind, I think such a question only makes sense when talking about specific tasks, like creative writing, data extraction from text, answering knowledge questions, refactoring code, writing greenfield code, etc. In some of these areas the smaller open models are very good and not that far behind. In other areas they are lagging much more, due to their inherent limitations. reply",

I've only had it a couple of months, but so far it's proving its worth in the quality of LLM output, even quantized. I generally run Qwen3-vl at 235b, at a Q4_K_M quantization level so that it fits, and it leaves me plenty of RAM for workstation tasks while delivering tokens at around 30tok/s The smaller Qwen3 models (like qwen3-coder) I use in tandem, of course they run much faster and I tend to run them at higher quants up to Q8 for quality purposes. The gigantic RAM's biggest boon, I've found, is letting me run the models with full context allocated, which lets me hand them larger and more complicated things than I could before.  This alone makes the money I spent worth it, IMO. I did manage to get glm-4.7 (a 358b model) running at a Q3 quantization level; it's delivery is adequate quality-wise, although it delivers at 15tok/s, though I did have to cut down to only 128k context to leave me enough room for the desktop. If you get something this big, it's a powerhouse, but not nearly as much of a powerhouse as a dedicated nVidia GPU rig.  The point is to be able to run them _adequately_, not at production speeds, to get your work done.  I found price/performance/energy usage to be compelling at this level and I am very satisfied. reply",

It's usable with opencode and crush, though my main motivation for getting it was specifically to be able to process personal data (e.g. emails) privately, and to experiment freely with abliterated models for security research. Also, I appreciate being able to run it off solar power. I'm still trying to figure out a good solution for fast external storage, I only went for 1TB internal which doesn't go very far with models that have hundreds of billions of parameters. reply",

          "text": "I have a maxed out M3 Ultra. It runs quantized large open Chinese models pretty well. It's slow-ish, but since I don't use them very frequently, most of the time is waiting to the model to load from disk to RAM. There are benchmarks on token generation speed out there for some of the large models. You can probably guess the speed for models you're interested in by comparing the sizes (mostly look at the active params). Currently the main issue for M1-M4 is the prompt \"preprocessing\" speed. In practical terms, if you have a very long prompt, it's going to take a much long time to process it.  IIRC it's due to lack of efficient matrix multiplication operations in the hardware, which I hear is rectified in the M5 architecture. So if you need to process long prompts, don't count on the Mac Studio, at least not with large models. So in short, if your prompts are relatively short (eg. a couple thousand tokens at most), you need/want a large model, you don't need too much scale/speed, and you need to run inference locally, then Macs are a reasonable option. For me personally, I got my M3 Ultra somewhat due to geopolitical issues. I'm barred from accessing some of the SOTA models from the US due to where I live, and sometimes the Chinese models are not conveniently accessible either. With the hardware, they can pry DeepSeek R1, Kimi-K2, etc. from my cold dead hands lol. reply",

          "text": "I went looking for the latest line of apple computers after reading this thread and I noticed they force you into the higher CPU's in order to get the higher amounts of unified memory. So not only are they content charging +$400 or +$600 for RAM which in itself ludicrously overpriced, they force you to upgrade +$1000-2000 on the top CPU's. Its impossible to spec a macbook pro or a mac mini with a base CPU and a decent amount of RAM. Total scam since they know people want the RAM to use with local LLMs. This was not always the case - When I specced out my macbook pro M1 16gb it was entirely possible to get 32 and 64gb without any tie-in to CPU upgrades. I was ready to drop a few grand on a new macbook pro M5 or M4 pro with a decent amount of RAM but it's currently set up to be an insane price gouge. To get 32GB of RAM it's an M5 chip price $1999. To get 64GB of RAM you are forced to to grab the M4 max CPU, and it's $3,899 on apple right now. What a scam. reply",

It should be 60-75F beautiful sunny days until the day I die. Insane politics? I’ll live 2800 miles away around hippies and liberals. I don’t need to watch the news. Things getting expensive? Make more money so it doesn’t affect me. People are suffering everywhere? Dawg I’m suffering too, so I’ll believe in something irrational so it doesn’t affect me. Maybe not what you wanted to hear. But I’m a realist and wasted a few years of my life trying to think of those things. Ultimately, it’s not worth it. I’ll support things that make sense and I don’t eat meat or drive a gas guzzler.

HN is often around the early majority of the Innovation Adoption curve. I was actually going to ask why Clawdbot wasn't even mentioned on HN when it had been everywhere else... but the news did hit the front page a few days later. There's a few killer updates from the AI coding groups which only get 0-2 upvotes and disappear. HN is not the place to go to be up to date on AI, it's where you go to see the news that has hit the mainstream. Opus 4.6 was \"leaked\" on media and hyped as if it were Claude 5 or something.

          "text": "Not a full team adoption story, but relevant data point: I run a small engineering org (~40 engineers across teams) and we've been tracking AI coding tool adoption informally. The split is roughly: 30% all-in (Claude Code or Cursor for everything), 50% selective users (use it for boilerplate, tests, docs but still hand-write core logic), 20% holdouts. What I've noticed on PR velocity: it went up initially, then plateaued. The PRs got bigger, which means reviews take longer. We actually had to introduce a \"max diff size\" policy because AI-assisted PRs were becoming 800+ line monsters that nobody could review meaningfully. The quality concern that keeps coming up: security. AI-generated code tends to take shortcuts on auth, input validation, error handling. We've started running dedicated security scans specifically tuned for patterns that AI likes to produce. That's been the biggest process change. Net effect: probably 20-30% faster on feature delivery, but we're spending more time on review and security validation than before. reply",

          "text": "\"Confidently wrong\" is the perfect description. The code compiles, the tests pass (because the AI also wrote the tests to match), and the auth flow looks reasonable at first glance. For catching these we layer a few things: - Standard SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL) catches the obvious stuff but misses AI-specific patterns\n- npm audit / pip-audit for dependency issues, especially non-existent packages the AI hallucinates\n- Custom rules tuned for patterns we keep seeing: overly permissive CORS, missing rate limiting, auth checks that look correct but have subtle logic bugs\n- Manual review with a specific checklist for AI-generated code (different from our normal review checklist) You're right that current tooling has a gap. Traditional scanners assume human-written code patterns. AI code looks structurally different - it tends to be more verbose but miss edge cases in ways humans wouldn't. We've been experimenting with scanning approaches specifically tuned for AI output. The biggest wins have been simple: requiring all AI-generated auth and input validation code to go through a dedicated security reviewer, not just a regular code review. reply",

Companies, including startups, come to us with broken systems and spaghetti code and architecture caused by weak prompts, unclear requirements, and no verification. It is important to understand that the efficiency gains we are seeing do not come from the tools alone. They come from a specific combination: 1) Engineers who have spent 20 years building everything from robotics to enterprise-scale technology. You cannot give a perfect instruction to an AI if you do not know what perfect looks like in a production environment. 2) A technical prompt should not be treated as a quick input or question. It is a detailed specification that requires experience and deliberate thinking. 3) Knowing the right combination of tools, workflows, and validation processes. That said, some (many?) members of our team are dinosaurs in the software engineering world. They bring a ton of experience but are used to tools from 15 years ago and don't like change. We really had to push AI adoption (mostly Cursor and Claude Code) on them. It’s still an ongoing process, and probably will be for a while. reply",

          "text": "I was on a greenfield project late last year with a team that was very enthusiastic about coding agents. I would personally call it a failure, and the project is quietly being wound down after only a few months. It went in a few stages: At first, it proceeded very quickly. Using agents, the team were able to generate a lot of code very fast, and so they were checking off requirements at an amazing pace. PRs were rubber stamped, and I found myself arguing with copy/pasted answers from an agent most of the time I tried to offer feedback. As the components started to get more integrated, things started breaking. At first these were obvious things with easy fixes, like some code calling other code with wrong arguments, and the coding agents could handle those. But a lot of the code was written in the overly-defensive style agents were fond of, so there were a lot more subtle errors. Things like the agent adding code to substitute an invalid default value in instead of erroring out, far away from where that value was causing other errors. At this point, the agents started making things strictly worse because they couldn't fit that much code in their context. Instead of actually fixing bugs, they'd catch any exceptions and substitute in more defaults. There was some manual work by some engineers to remove a lot of the defensive code, but they could not keep up with the agents. This is also about when the team discovered that most of the tests were effectively \"assert true\" because they mocked out so much. We did ship the project, but it shipped in an incredibly buggy state, and also the performance was terrible. And, as I said, it's now being wound down. That's probably the right thing to do because it would be easier to restart from scratch than try to make sense of the mess we ended up with. Agents were used to write the documentation, and very little of it is comprehensible. We did screw some things up. People were so enthusiastic about agents, and they produced so much code so fast, that code reviews were essentially non-existent. Instead of taking action on feedback in the reviews, a lot of the time there was some LLM-generated \"won't do\" response that sounded plausible enough that it could convince managers that the reviewers were slowing things down. We also didn't explicitly figure out things like how error-handling or logging should work ahead of time, and so what the agents did was all over the place depending on what was in their context. Maybe the whole mess was a necessary learning as we figure out these new ways of working. Personally I'm still using the coding agents, but very selectively to \"fill-in-the-blanks\" on code where I know what it should look like, but don't need to write it all by hand myself. reply",

          "text": "I'd speculate we had a few factors working against us that made us hit the \"limit\" sooner. Several different engineering teams from different parts of the company had to come together for this, and the overall architecture was modular, so there was a lot of complexity before we had to start integrating. We have some company-wide standards and conventions, but they don't cover everything. To work on the code, you might need to know module A does something one way and module B does it in a different way because different teams were involved. That was implicit in how human engineers worked on it, and so it wasn't explicitly explained to the coding agents. The project was in the life sciences space, and the quality of code in the training data has to be worse than something like a B2B SaaS app. A lot of code in the domain is written by scientists, not software engineers, and only needs to work long enough to publish the paper. So any code an LLM writes is going to look like that by default unless an engineer is paying attention. I don't know that either of those would be insurmountable if the company were willing to burn more tokens, but I'd guess it's an order of magnitude more than we spent already. There are politics as well. There have been other changes in the company, and it seems like the current leadership wants to free up resources to work on completely different things, so there's no will to throw more tokens at untangling the mess. I don't disbelieve the success stories, but I think most of them are either at the level of following already successful patterns instead of doing much novel, or from companies with much bigger budgets for inference. If Anthropic burns a bunch of money to make a C compiler, they can make it back from increased investor hype, but most companies are not in that position. reply",

          "text": "As someone that has already had to \"rescue\" several of those oft-praised \"AI-first\" projects you hear all about, I can safely say this: \"It's not going super well.\" The LLM-produced code I've seen thus far (from moderate feature PRs up to and including entire services), tends twords 'too large' or 'too complex' to properly vet by their small team of creators; PRs against existing codebases are often riddled with minor, seemingly unrelated changes or worse: large and/or subtle test suite alterations that \"all pass\" but contain hidden assumptions in conflict with reality and your business requirements. Numerous edge cases go entirely missed, overly trivial things are validated instead, etc. Feedback loops with the system certainly improves output but is frustrating and in many cases no faster than just writing the code yourself. At this stage you still need a human in the loop, unless you're still in the earliest stages of building a product.  This being HN I'm sure someone around here is employing LLMs successfully in those cases, but the story for established orgs tends to be more complex, especially in traditionally risk averse fields like healthcare, billing, credit card processing, defense, etc. All fields I've worked in. The sheer amount of code these LLM systems produce in aggregate means that we have a deficit of cognitive spoons across our orgs to properly review and test all these changes that are being pumped out. In other words: more bugs end up getting found in the field instead of earlier because we're allowing our generators to validate themselves due to resource constraints. Can we produce code faster than ever before? Sure, but that was never the real bottleneck to begin with, at least in the orgs that I've operated within the past 2 decades. To me, every new line of code needs an inherent justification for its existence.  Code is often as much a liability as it  is an asset. Think on several axis like risk of security vulnerabilities or cognitive load limits when no one left in your org understands your vibe-coded system anymore, as it grows more unwieldy by the day. The business value of new code being introduced should outway its (not so) hidden cost of maintenance and risk of business disruption. With today's emphasis on using LLM output for \"moving faster\", we seem to be ignoring that critical risk/reward analysis and operating under the incorrect assumption that more code is universally a good thing. So for the moment I'm just using LLMs for \"rubber ducking\" or spitballing/testing out ideas before committing to a course of action; an action that will ultimately get executed by a human in the short term at least. That said, on a good day my AI can serve as a proxy for a semi-competent software engineer (with amnesia), and no worse than an actual rubber duck on the others.

          "text": "Yes, the two are very different in that regard. WireGuard is 4k LoC and is very intentional about its choice of using a single, static crypto implementation to drastically reduce its complexity. Technically speaking, it has a lower attack surface for that reason. That said, I've been on your side of the argument before, and practically speaking you can expose OpenSSH on the public internet with a proper key setup and almost certainly nothing will happen because it's a highly-audited, proven piece of software. Even though it's technically very complex. But , that still doesn't mean it isn't best practice to avoid exposing it to the public internet. Especially when you can put things in front of it (such as WireGuard) that have a much lower technical complexity, and thus a reduced attack surface. reply",

          "text": "No, they are not. Doesn’t matter how many LoC; it only take 1 LoC to introduce a vulnerability. Wireguard is a protocol. So what implementation is “very intentional about its choice of …”? Are you talking about my own WG client implementation? Or the one made by this other Chinese vendor? I don’t care what software we are talking about, or who made it. All software has a risk of undiscovered/-disclosed vulnerabilities already existing, or when new ones introduced with an update. If you really want to make this argument we can talk about the implementing organisations SDLC, including SW supply chain, and compare those. But back to the OP/point above: its false to state that one piece of software has a “principle risk” of vulnerabilities that another piece does not. At least, not when both are internet exposed and accepting incoming data. Lasty remember that I never disagreed with you point that a VPN solution is often a better solution, but that was never what I was arguing about. Simply that all code always has a risk of vulnerabilities. No piece of software is excempt from that. reply",

That's like the third or fourth time you've scare-quoted the word principle . You're aware that principle and principal are two different words with different meanings? The word I used, principal , in that context means the foremost or primary risk. Anyways, I'm just telling you how major corporations think about it.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been using Claude Code this evening and I’m very dismayed by Opus 4.6’s ability to follow instructions. I have given it very clear instructions on several points, only to discover it ignored me without telling me.<p>When I asked it for a list of things that deviated from the spec, it told me everything was as expected. Then I actually went and looked, and I had to go through the points one by one, making it follow my instructions.<p>When I confronted it about this, it told me:<p>&gt; I kept second-guessing your design decisions instead of implementing what you asked for … the mistakes I made weren’t a model capability issue - I understood your instructions fine and chose to deviate from them.<p>This is not acceptable. Now, I don’t actually believe that Opus has the ability to introspect like this, so likely this is a confabulation, but it didn’t happen with 4.5. Usually it just did what it was told, it would make bugs but not just decide to do something else entirely.<p>I want a model that actually does what I tell it. I don’t see anything online about how to get 4.5 back.<p>Any help?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "In my opinion, Opus 4.6 handles instructions (especially negative rules) better than Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5. It also applies skills better than other models. But I think this is individual. Another example. I asked gpt-5.2-codex to add an array of 5 values to the script and write a small piece of code. Then I manually deleted one of the values in the array and asked the agent to commit.\nBut the model edited the file again and added the value I deleted to the array.\nI deleted that value again and asked the agent to “just commit.” But the agent edited the file again before committing.\nThis happened many times, and I used different commands, such as “never edit the file, just commit.” The model responded that it understood the command and began editing the file. I switched to gpt-5.2, but that didn't help. I switched to sonnet-4.5, and it immediately committed on the first try without editing the file. reply",

          "text": "GPT-5 used to do this on release, but seems to have reverted back, especially on the codex versions. This may well be a feature. I joked that this is the side effect of asking it to act like a senior software engineer. It tends to talk back and do its own thing. There was that one time when the thought processes went \"I'm a full stack engineer\" > \"I'm expanding my connections on LinkedIn\" > \"I'm establishing myself as a tech writer\" > \"I'm evaluating classes in professional writing\". It does have introspection capabilities, but one could argue it's just a bug or emergent. Anyway, option 1: why not just use Sonnet? Heck you can use Haiku if you're giving it clear instructions. The thinking ones do perform worse on clear tasks. You also get your rolled back version. Option 2: Use role prompting [0]\nGive it some junior engineer role where it's expected to follow instructions exactly as given.

          "text": "This is how BigCo works. They are optimized for resilience and providing predictable cashflows for investors, not efficiency as such. If they had, say, 2 \"10x\" engineers who were brilliant and could do everything with no red tape or inefficiency, then one or both of them could leave, or demand pay raises, and the company would be screwed - it would be a very brittle, unsustainable period of efficiency. So, it's better to have 20 1x engineers, with significant slack in the system, who are all interchangeable cogs in a machine that takes tickets in one end and pushes mediocre software out the other end. That way, if 5 or 10 of them leave, they can be replaced, and nobody will tell the difference. If there's a lean quarter, you can lay off half of them, and then rehire a bunch of average randos off the street a few months later, and again, nobody will be able to tell the difference. Also, the mayor will visit the grand opening of the new office, and the media will write a lovely story about how many jobs have been \"created\", and the company will be able to negotiate some tax breaks for creating so many mediocre jobs. You might find things are better at a mom & pop, or startup, or maybe outside of a big city. reply",

          "text": "So I work for a small defense contractor, for more than 2 years now. The means to success so far is almost entirely in the soft skills. It’s helpful to understand the technology but the soft skills are so much more important. It’s certainly the 80/20 rule. Here is what I mean by soft skills: * Actually caring about people. Checking up on your peers and seeing if they need help. * Constant awareness of the people under your management. Having some idea of what they are working on where their pain points are. They should always know they can come to you if they have a problem. * Tracking down undocumented requirements by actually talking to people and getting to know more people. * Constant awareness of hot issues affecting major projects and operating status. Since my business is technology contracting the business goal is to put people into employment and retain those people to the success of the client. The more I retain people the more successful I am to my employer. The inefficiency of the work is up to the client and coordinating business partners. I started here as a developer and within a year was promoted to a manager. In the contract I am still a developer. The complexity there is that I operate in partnership with an another company who would prefer I were a junior developer even though I manage 15 seats. It’s still all about the soft skills. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We're a YC W23 company building AI agents for engineering labs - our customers run similar analyses repeatedly, and the agent treated every session like a blank slate.<p>We looked at Mem0, Letta/MemGPT, and similar memory solutions. They all solve a different problem: storing facts from conversations — \"user prefers Python,\" \"user is vegetarian.\" That's key-value memory with semantic search. Useful, but not what we needed.<p>What we needed was something that learns user patterns implicitly from behavior over time. When a customer corrects a threshold from 85% to 80% three sessions in a row, the agent should just know that next time. When a team always re-runs with stricter filters, the system should pick up on that pattern.\nSo we built an internal API around a simple idea: user corrections are the highest-signal data. Instead of ingesting chat messages and hoping an LLM extracts something, we capture structured events — what the agent produced, what the user changed, what they accepted. A background job periodically runs an LLM pass to extract patterns and builds a confidence-weighted preference profile per user/team/org.<p>Before each session, the agent fetches the profile and gets smarter over time.\nThe gap as I see it:<p>Mem0 = memory storage + retrieval. Doesn't learn patterns.<p>Letta = self-editing agent memory. Closer, but no implicit learning from behavior.<p>Missing = a preference learning layer that watches how users interact with agents and builds an evolving model. Like a rec engine for agent personalization.<p>I built this for our domain but the approach is domain-agnostic. Curious if others are hitting the same wall with their agents. Happy to share the architecture, prompts, and confidence scoring approach in detail.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

In general, the “chat history mining” sector seems to be way under-developed to me so far. All the damn time I am annoyed I have to re-tell my LLM a piece of info I have already told it a few weeks ago - finding the chat takes too long and the full history may not be relevant, but the fact wasn’t interesting enough to manually add to memory. With the right memory system, the LLM could just know! Does anyone have other interesting examples of this principle being applied? reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Title basically tries to capture the gist of the  question. I have been asked (volunteer) to assist in the project of migration from a proprietary, more costly CRM solution, to an Odoo Community \"product\", to be architected, configured, deployed in a cloud service and operated by a specialized partner. My specialization is in infrastructure (architecture, ops and security), so I could certainly validate mapping the apps functionality into the right components, but I have zero knowledge on how good the CRM part is, and - crucially - how to keep its possible need for customization in time and operations cost low, if internal org volunteers have no technical skills. I am concerned about the integrator attempt to get the foot in the door with an acceptable one time cost, then slowly ramp up the price, if this solution requires a lot of babysitting.<p>Does anyone have any experience with this Odoo Community CRM product and model, to share some gotchas, in the light of the above described attempt to use? Users max 300. The hope is to also have the CRM integrate with needed office products (doc, spreadsheet, email, etc.)</p></div>",

          "text": "I've implemented Odoo Community for a few small orgs and it's solid for nonprofits if you have the technical resources to maintain it. The main gotchas are: it requires significant PostgreSQL knowledge for customizations, the upgrade path between major versions can be painful (especially with custom modules), and while the community edition is free, you'll likely need paid modules for advanced CRM features like email marketing automation. Since you mentioned migration - the data import process is where most projects get stuck. Odoo's import tools are decent but you'll probably need custom Python scripts for complex data transformations from your current CRM. One thing I learned while building automation tools is that many small nonprofits actually need something simpler than a full CRM - often they just need better task management and follow-up tracking from their existing email communications. I've been beta testing ungrind.ai which handles that specific piece (auto-creates tasks from emails/meetings), though it's designed more for individual consultants than organizations. What's your current CRM and roughly how many contacts/complexity are you migrating? That would help determine if Odoo Community's data model limitations might be an issue. reply",

By the time someone lands on your site, the most important decision may have already happened upstream and you have no idea. The UTM case you mentioned is a good example: it only captures direct \"AI to site\" clicks, but misses scenarios where AI influences the decision indirectly (brand mention to later search to visit). From the site’s perspective tho... yeah it looks indistinguishable from organic search. It makes me wonder whether we’ll need a completely new mental model for attribution here. Perhaps less about “what query drove this visit” and more about “where did trust originate.” Not sure what the right solution is yet, but it feels like we’re flying blind during a pretty major shift in how people discover things. reply",

I'm struggling to find the motivation to write up my notes (neurodiversity both helping me see the problem and stopping me do anything about it).  I'm struggling to name  the theory. I am struggling ( with some limited success) in noticing what I do differently. I'm also struggling with recovering from a major burnout from succeeding creating highly motivated teams in really tough organisations. I thought all along that I would be better with a collaborator watching me and noting the differences between what I do and what everyone else is doing, then interviewing me about it. Maybe I could publish bits of it, little tidbits of blogs (who would find them?) or social media videos (I really don't want to have to record and edit videos). Not sure how to get progress. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for taking a moment to reply. Firstly, I have met very few malicious people in my career. Most of the really destructive people are products of their environments. It is complicated,  but it is normally an incentives problem, most commonly status/ power rather than monetary. Often they have created blocking processes that the company sees as some sort of control or policing. It tends to be rather easy to change that if you are their boss . It is harder, but not impossible as a colleague. Often the application of cold hard rigorous logic,  an understanding of the real controls etc. Can unstick them. I work in a 100k person company at the moment (admittedly I'm not in charge of that many of them), so I understand the problem of scale, but I would counter that the changes neede are rather subtle. I think much can be achieved by focusing on the 20 people at the top. Culture cascades. For example if you dig in over a KPI not being achieved, when someone explains that it is counterproductive, or conflicts with another KPI,  how do you think they will manage their team in future? reply",

Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

Readers get wild gadgets, sneaky pranks, and fast chases—plus the chance to ask what they would do if adults tried to control every thought in their head.

Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

I guess you can imagine it as creating paths for the electrons to flow! I do like the ease of visually drawing schematics, however for some parts of circuit design, it gets repetitive and the GUI (used Altium, Allegro and Kicad professionally) gets in the way. For more complex circuit changes, it can be much easier to diff text rather than graphics, since text can capture intent better. reply",

I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

          "text": "I recently retired after 37 years of working in tech so of course I am working on open source. My retirement treat was to spend three months learning OpenGL and 3D game programming by porting a classic Java RTS game, Tribal Trouble, to more modern OpenGL and Java. I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. ( https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble ) For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. ( https://wireshark.org ) I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun. reply",

It's been growing steadily with a community of ~1,400 subscribers on YouTube and paying users. What I'm most excited about right now is DB Pro Studio: a collaborative web-based version I'm building on top of it. The idea is simple: databases are a team activity, but every DB tool treats them as a single-player experience. Studio adds either a self-hosted or managed hosted data browser, real-time collaboration, dashboards, visual workflow automation, and enterprise features like audit logging and role-based access. Think \"database command center\" where your whole team can inspect, query, and build on your data together. The desktop app acts as the execution engine (your data never leaves your infrastructure), while Studio provides the shared dashboard layer. I've also consistently posted devlogs on YT throughout the journey, which has helped build a community of ~1,400 subscribers who've shaped the product along the way. Site: https://dbpro.app YouTube: https://youtube.com/@dbproapp Would love feedback from anyone who's felt the pain of sharing database context across a team. reply",

It seems like the model is massively weighted on code written using spaces (duh). Despite having a very well articulated styleguide (that Codex helped me write after examining my codebase!) that clearly specifies that tabs are used for indentation, the model will happily go off and make a bunch of changes that incorporate spaces seemingly at random. It will use tabs correctly in certain places, but then devolve back to using spaces later on in the same files.<p>I have a linter that I've taught the model to run to catch these things, but A) that feels like such a waste of tokens and B) the model often forgets to run the linter anyway.<p>It's like having a junior developer who has never used the tab key before. They remember to ctrl-f their spaces-&gt;tabs sometimes before opening a PR, but not all the time. So I wind up giving them the same feedback over and over.<p>This example -- tabs instead of spaces -- is just one specific case where the model seems to invariably converge on a local maximum that is dictated by the center of the software bell curve. But in general I'm finding it to be true of just about any \"quirky\" style opinion I want to enforce:<p>- Avoid Typescript's `any` or `unknown`: the model will still happily throw these in to make the compiler happy<p>- Avoid complex ternaries: nope, the model loves these<p>- Avoid inscrutable one-letter variables versus longer, self-descriptive ones: nope, `a` it is<p>It just seems like I'm using a tool that is really good at producing the average software output by the average software developer. It's not able to keep my aesthetic / architectural desires at the front of its thinking as it's making my desired changes. It's as if I hired the guy from Memento as an intern.<p>How do people get around this, other than slathering on even more admonitions to use tabs no matter what (thereby wasting valuable tokens)?<p>Beyond syntax, I'm still able to use the models to crudely implement new features or functionality, but the way they write code feels... inelegant. There's often a single unifying insight within grasp that the model could reach for to greatly simplify the code it wrote for a given task, but it's not able to see it without me telling it that it's there.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There are exceptions to ever rule, but generally patents are (1) not incredibly important in software (2) solving a question that's secondary. The biggest risk to building a startup isn't \"can I build this thing\" (feasibility risk). It's \"will people even care if I build this thing\" (value risk) then \"can I do it in a way people use\" (usability risk).  Patents help solve business risk, but that's generally considered to be the 4th (and last) of the risks. There are exceptions where patents do need to be filed first or the business viability dies. However, I generally assume that if you've addressed value, usability, and feasibility risks to create something truly meaningful, your competitors will find a work around to deliver the same value, usability, and feasibility without infringing on your patent. Thus, patents, are nothing but a minor inconvenience. In some cases, the public filing of a patent, can give your competitors a leg up on competing with you. https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/ reply",

          "text": "If you're in the US, look into relevant court cases[0][1][2]. The courts tend to hold that algorithms are not patentable - what is patentable would be an invented machine which uses a software algorithm as one of its components. But even then, the machine needs to have some other inventive, patentable physical component. (This sort of thing tend to confuse people since, the US patent office doesn't check for patent validity before granting patents. So there are a lot of companies that own invalid patents which have simply never been challenged in court.) If you live elsewhere you should look into the laws of your local jurisdiction, but many places have the same or similar legal doctrine.

          "text": "I am!  I moved from a shoebox Linux workstation with 32MB of RAM and a 12GB RTX 3060 to a 256GB M3 Ultra, mainly for unified memory. I've only had it a couple of months, but so far it's proving its worth in the quality of LLM output, even quantized. I generally run Qwen3-vl at 235b, at a Q4_K_M quantization level so that it fits, and it leaves me plenty of RAM for workstation tasks while delivering tokens at around 30tok/s The smaller Qwen3 models (like qwen3-coder) I use in tandem, of course they run much faster and I tend to run them at higher quants up to Q8 for quality purposes. The gigantic RAM's biggest boon, I've found, is letting me run the models with full context allocated, which lets me hand them larger and more complicated things than I could before.  This alone makes the money I spent worth it, IMO. I did manage to get glm-4.7 (a 358b model) running at a Q3 quantization level; it's delivery is adequate quality-wise, although it delivers at 15tok/s, though I did have to cut down to only 128k context to leave me enough room for the desktop. If you get something this big, it's a powerhouse, but not nearly as much of a powerhouse as a dedicated nVidia GPU rig.  The point is to be able to run them _adequately_, not at production speeds, to get your work done.  I found price/performance/energy usage to be compelling at this level and I am very satisfied. reply",

Later I'm gonna use my own custom local LLM system on the Mac Studio, probably orchestrated by LangChain and running models with llama.cpp. My goal has all the time been to use them in ensembles in order to reduce model biases. The same principle has just now been introduced as a feature called \"model council\" in Perplexity Max: https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-model-council Chats will be stored in and recalled from a PostgreSQL database with extensions for vectors (pgvector) and graph (Apache AGE).

          "text": "I have a maxed out M3 Ultra. It runs quantized large open Chinese models pretty well. It's slow-ish, but since I don't use them very frequently, most of the time is waiting to the model to load from disk to RAM. There are benchmarks on token generation speed out there for some of the large models. You can probably guess the speed for models you're interested in by comparing the sizes (mostly look at the active params). Currently the main issue for M1-M4 is the prompt \"preprocessing\" speed. In practical terms, if you have a very long prompt, it's going to take a much long time to process it.  IIRC it's due to lack of efficient matrix multiplication operations in the hardware, which I hear is rectified in the M5 architecture. So if you need to process long prompts, don't count on the Mac Studio, at least not with large models. So in short, if your prompts are relatively short (eg. a couple thousand tokens at most), you need/want a large model, you don't need too much scale/speed, and you need to run inference locally, then Macs are a reasonable option. For me personally, I got my M3 Ultra somewhat due to geopolitical issues. I'm barred from accessing some of the SOTA models from the US due to where I live, and sometimes the Chinese models are not conveniently accessible either. With the hardware, they can pry DeepSeek R1, Kimi-K2, etc. from my cold dead hands lol. reply",

So not only are they content charging +$400 or +$600 for RAM which in itself ludicrously overpriced, they force you to upgrade +$1000-2000 on the top CPU's. Its impossible to spec a macbook pro or a mac mini with a base CPU and a decent amount of RAM. Total scam since they know people want the RAM to use with local LLMs. This was not always the case - When I specced out my macbook pro M1 16gb it was entirely possible to get 32 and 64gb without any tie-in to CPU upgrades. I was ready to drop a few grand on a new macbook pro M5 or M4 pro with a decent amount of RAM but it's currently set up to be an insane price gouge. To get 32GB of RAM it's an M5 chip price $1999. To get 64GB of RAM you are forced to to grab the M4 max CPU, and it's $3,899 on apple right now. What a scam. reply",

It should be 60-75F beautiful sunny days until the day I die. Insane politics? I’ll live 2800 miles away around hippies and liberals. I don’t need to watch the news. Things getting expensive? Make more money so it doesn’t affect me. People are suffering everywhere? Dawg I’m suffering too, so I’ll believe in something irrational so it doesn’t affect me. Maybe not what you wanted to hear. But I’m a realist and wasted a few years of my life trying to think of those things. Ultimately, it’s not worth it. I’ll support things that make sense and I don’t eat meat or drive a gas guzzler. What more do you want? When you ask  your titular question you’re already in a minority of the population. Many people continue to make dumbass decisions that affect everyone else in negative ways.

          "text": "A local model is an open model you run locally, so I'm not entirely sure the distinction in the question makes sense. That said, if you're talking about models you can actually use on a single regular computer that costs less than a new home, the current crop of open models are very capable but also have noticeable limitations. Small models will always have limitations in terms of capability and especially knowledge. Improved training data and training regiment can squeeze out more from the same number of weights, but there is a limit. So with that in mind, I think such a question only makes sense when talking about specific tasks, like creative writing, data extraction from text, answering knowledge questions, refactoring code, writing greenfield code, etc. In some of these areas the smaller open models are very good and not that far behind. In other areas they are lagging much more, due to their inherent limitations. reply",

Or you like a post by the anti-AI folks and your feed is now on how useless or harmful it is. With HN, we all see the same news. But now it's far to the extreme of either party. HN is often around the early majority of the Innovation Adoption curve. I was actually going to ask why Clawdbot wasn't even mentioned on HN when it had been everywhere else... but the news did hit the front page a few days later. There's a few killer updates from the AI coding groups which only get 0-2 upvotes and disappear. HN is not the place to go to be up to date on AI, it's where you go to see the news that has hit the mainstream. Opus 4.6 was \"leaked\" on media and hyped as if it were Claude 5 or something. By the time the news was actually out, people had formed their opinions. reply",

          "text": "Not a full team adoption story, but relevant data point: I run a small engineering org (~40 engineers across teams) and we've been tracking AI coding tool adoption informally. The split is roughly: 30% all-in (Claude Code or Cursor for everything), 50% selective users (use it for boilerplate, tests, docs but still hand-write core logic), 20% holdouts. What I've noticed on PR velocity: it went up initially, then plateaued. The PRs got bigger, which means reviews take longer. We actually had to introduce a \"max diff size\" policy because AI-assisted PRs were becoming 800+ line monsters that nobody could review meaningfully. The quality concern that keeps coming up: security. AI-generated code tends to take shortcuts on auth, input validation, error handling. We've started running dedicated security scans specifically tuned for patterns that AI likes to produce. That's been the biggest process change. Net effect: probably 20-30% faster on feature delivery, but we're spending more time on review and security validation than before. reply",

          "text": "\"Confidently wrong\" is the perfect description. The code compiles, the tests pass (because the AI also wrote the tests to match), and the auth flow looks reasonable at first glance. For catching these we layer a few things: - Standard SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL) catches the obvious stuff but misses AI-specific patterns\n- npm audit / pip-audit for dependency issues, especially non-existent packages the AI hallucinates\n- Custom rules tuned for patterns we keep seeing: overly permissive CORS, missing rate limiting, auth checks that look correct but have subtle logic bugs\n- Manual review with a specific checklist for AI-generated code (different from our normal review checklist) You're right that current tooling has a gap. Traditional scanners assume human-written code patterns. AI code looks structurally different - it tends to be more verbose but miss edge cases in ways humans wouldn't. We've been experimenting with scanning approaches specifically tuned for AI output. The biggest wins have been simple: requiring all AI-generated auth and input validation code to go through a dedicated security reviewer, not just a regular code review. reply",

They are not the norm, yet. But they demonstrate what is possible. We have also seen what happens when things go wrong. Companies, including startups, come to us with broken systems and spaghetti code and architecture caused by weak prompts, unclear requirements, and no verification. It is important to understand that the efficiency gains we are seeing do not come from the tools alone. They come from a specific combination: 1) Engineers who have spent 20 years building everything from robotics to enterprise-scale technology. You cannot give a perfect instruction to an AI if you do not know what perfect looks like in a production environment. 2) A technical prompt should not be treated as a quick input or question. It is a detailed specification that requires experience and deliberate thinking. 3) Knowing the right combination of tools, workflows, and validation processes. That said, some (many?) members of our team are dinosaurs in the software engineering world. They bring a ton of experience but are used to tools from 15 years ago and don't like change. We really had to push AI adoption (mostly Cursor and Claude Code) on them. It’s still an ongoing process, and probably will be for a while. reply",

          "text": "I was on a greenfield project late last year with a team that was very enthusiastic about coding agents. I would personally call it a failure, and the project is quietly being wound down after only a few months. It went in a few stages: At first, it proceeded very quickly. Using agents, the team were able to generate a lot of code very fast, and so they were checking off requirements at an amazing pace. PRs were rubber stamped, and I found myself arguing with copy/pasted answers from an agent most of the time I tried to offer feedback. As the components started to get more integrated, things started breaking. At first these were obvious things with easy fixes, like some code calling other code with wrong arguments, and the coding agents could handle those. But a lot of the code was written in the overly-defensive style agents were fond of, so there were a lot more subtle errors. Things like the agent adding code to substitute an invalid default value in instead of erroring out, far away from where that value was causing other errors. At this point, the agents started making things strictly worse because they couldn't fit that much code in their context. Instead of actually fixing bugs, they'd catch any exceptions and substitute in more defaults. There was some manual work by some engineers to remove a lot of the defensive code, but they could not keep up with the agents. This is also about when the team discovered that most of the tests were effectively \"assert true\" because they mocked out so much. We did ship the project, but it shipped in an incredibly buggy state, and also the performance was terrible. And, as I said, it's now being wound down. That's probably the right thing to do because it would be easier to restart from scratch than try to make sense of the mess we ended up with. Agents were used to write the documentation, and very little of it is comprehensible. We did screw some things up. People were so enthusiastic about agents, and they produced so much code so fast, that code reviews were essentially non-existent. Instead of taking action on feedback in the reviews, a lot of the time there was some LLM-generated \"won't do\" response that sounded plausible enough that it could convince managers that the reviewers were slowing things down. We also didn't explicitly figure out things like how error-handling or logging should work ahead of time, and so what the agents did was all over the place depending on what was in their context. Maybe the whole mess was a necessary learning as we figure out these new ways of working. Personally I'm still using the coding agents, but very selectively to \"fill-in-the-blanks\" on code where I know what it should look like, but don't need to write it all by hand myself. reply",

          "text": "I'd speculate we had a few factors working against us that made us hit the \"limit\" sooner. Several different engineering teams from different parts of the company had to come together for this, and the overall architecture was modular, so there was a lot of complexity before we had to start integrating. We have some company-wide standards and conventions, but they don't cover everything. To work on the code, you might need to know module A does something one way and module B does it in a different way because different teams were involved. That was implicit in how human engineers worked on it, and so it wasn't explicitly explained to the coding agents. The project was in the life sciences space, and the quality of code in the training data has to be worse than something like a B2B SaaS app. A lot of code in the domain is written by scientists, not software engineers, and only needs to work long enough to publish the paper. So any code an LLM writes is going to look like that by default unless an engineer is paying attention. I don't know that either of those would be insurmountable if the company were willing to burn more tokens, but I'd guess it's an order of magnitude more than we spent already. There are politics as well. There have been other changes in the company, and it seems like the current leadership wants to free up resources to work on completely different things, so there's no will to throw more tokens at untangling the mess. I don't disbelieve the success stories, but I think most of them are either at the level of following already successful patterns instead of doing much novel, or from companies with much bigger budgets for inference. If Anthropic burns a bunch of money to make a C compiler, they can make it back from increased investor hype, but most companies are not in that position. reply",

          "text": "As someone that has already had to \"rescue\" several of those oft-praised \"AI-first\" projects you hear all about, I can safely say this: \"It's not going super well.\" The LLM-produced code I've seen thus far (from moderate feature PRs up to and including entire services), tends twords 'too large' or 'too complex' to properly vet by their small team of creators; PRs against existing codebases are often riddled with minor, seemingly unrelated changes or worse: large and/or subtle test suite alterations that \"all pass\" but contain hidden assumptions in conflict with reality and your business requirements. Numerous edge cases go entirely missed, overly trivial things are validated instead, etc. Feedback loops with the system certainly improves output but is frustrating and in many cases no faster than just writing the code yourself. At this stage you still need a human in the loop, unless you're still in the earliest stages of building a product.  This being HN I'm sure someone around here is employing LLMs successfully in those cases, but the story for established orgs tends to be more complex, especially in traditionally risk averse fields like healthcare, billing, credit card processing, defense, etc. All fields I've worked in. The sheer amount of code these LLM systems produce in aggregate means that we have a deficit of cognitive spoons across our orgs to properly review and test all these changes that are being pumped out. In other words: more bugs end up getting found in the field instead of earlier because we're allowing our generators to validate themselves due to resource constraints. Can we produce code faster than ever before? Sure, but that was never the real bottleneck to begin with, at least in the orgs that I've operated within the past 2 decades. To me, every new line of code needs an inherent justification for its existence.  Code is often as much a liability as it  is an asset. Think on several axis like risk of security vulnerabilities or cognitive load limits when no one left in your org understands your vibe-coded system anymore, as it grows more unwieldy by the day. The business value of new code being introduced should outway its (not so) hidden cost of maintenance and risk of business disruption. With today's emphasis on using LLM output for \"moving faster\", we seem to be ignoring that critical risk/reward analysis and operating under the incorrect assumption that more code is universally a good thing. So for the moment I'm just using LLMs for \"rubber ducking\" or spitballing/testing out ideas before committing to a course of action; an action that will ultimately get executed by a human in the short term at least. That said, on a good day my AI can serve as a proxy for a semi-competent software engineer (with amnesia), and no worse than an actual rubber duck on the others.

Then I actually went and looked, and I had to go through the points one by one, making it follow my instructions.<p>When I confronted it about this, it told me:<p>&gt; I kept second-guessing your design decisions instead of implementing what you asked for … the mistakes I made weren’t a model capability issue - I understood your instructions fine and chose to deviate from them.<p>This is not acceptable. Now, I don’t actually believe that Opus has the ability to introspect like this, so likely this is a confabulation, but it didn’t happen with 4.5. Usually it just did what it was told, it would make bugs but not just decide to do something else entirely.<p>I want a model that actually does what I tell it.

Then I manually deleted one of the values in the array and asked the agent to commit.\nBut the model edited the file again and added the value I deleted to the array.\nI deleted that value again and asked the agent to “just commit.” But the agent edited the file again before committing.\nThis happened many times, and I used different commands, such as “never edit the file, just commit.” The model responded that it understood the command and began editing the file. I switched to gpt-5.2, but that didn't help. I switched to sonnet-4.5, and it immediately committed on the first try without editing the file. reply",

          "text": "This is how BigCo works. They are optimized for resilience and providing predictable cashflows for investors, not efficiency as such. If they had, say, 2 \"10x\" engineers who were brilliant and could do everything with no red tape or inefficiency, then one or both of them could leave, or demand pay raises, and the company would be screwed - it would be a very brittle, unsustainable period of efficiency. So, it's better to have 20 1x engineers, with significant slack in the system, who are all interchangeable cogs in a machine that takes tickets in one end and pushes mediocre software out the other end. That way, if 5 or 10 of them leave, they can be replaced, and nobody will tell the difference. If there's a lean quarter, you can lay off half of them, and then rehire a bunch of average randos off the street a few months later, and again, nobody will be able to tell the difference. Also, the mayor will visit the grand opening of the new office, and the media will write a lovely story about how many jobs have been \"created\", and the company will be able to negotiate some tax breaks for creating so many mediocre jobs. You might find things are better at a mom & pop, or startup, or maybe outside of a big city. reply",

          "text": "So I work for a small defense contractor, for more than 2 years now. The means to success so far is almost entirely in the soft skills. It’s helpful to understand the technology but the soft skills are so much more important. It’s certainly the 80/20 rule. Here is what I mean by soft skills: * Actually caring about people. Checking up on your peers and seeing if they need help. * Constant awareness of the people under your management. Having some idea of what they are working on where their pain points are. They should always know they can come to you if they have a problem. * Tracking down undocumented requirements by actually talking to people and getting to know more people. * Constant awareness of hot issues affecting major projects and operating status. Since my business is technology contracting the business goal is to put people into employment and retain those people to the success of the client. The more I retain people the more successful I am to my employer. The inefficiency of the work is up to the client and coordinating business partners. I started here as a developer and within a year was promoted to a manager. In the contract I am still a developer. The complexity there is that I operate in partnership with an another company who would prefer I were a junior developer even though I manage 15 seats. It’s still all about the soft skills. reply",

What’s strange is that we’re moving into a world where recommendations matter more than a click, but attribution still assumes a traditional search funnel. By the time someone lands on your site, the most important decision may have already happened upstream and you have no idea. The UTM case you mentioned is a good example: it only captures direct \"AI to site\" clicks, but misses scenarios where AI influences the decision indirectly (brand mention to later search to visit). From the site’s perspective tho... yeah it looks indistinguishable from organic search. It makes me wonder whether we’ll need a completely new mental model for attribution here. Perhaps less about “what query drove this visit” and more about “where did trust originate.” Not sure what the right solution is yet, but it feels like we’re flying blind during a pretty major shift in how people discover things. reply",

          "text": "Right there with you because SEO has evolved to a place that incentivizes a lot of bad behavior, and the end result made search worse for everyone. I’m personally less interested in “gaming” LLMs than understanding what they already do. From my side, this feels closer to observability than optimization when trying to see whether AI systems are even reading or understanding a site, not how to trick them into ranking something low quality. The Raymond Chen analogy brings up something interesting. If everyone forces themselves on top, the signal collapses. My hope is that AI systems end up rewarding genuinely useful, well explained things rather than creating another arms race...but I’m not naive about how incentives tend to play out. A huge concern of mine has been the introduction of ads. Once ads enter LLM responses, it’s hard not to ask whether we’re just rebuilding the same incentive structure that broke search in the first place. reply",
