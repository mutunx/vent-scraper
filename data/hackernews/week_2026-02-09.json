Imagine you, as a security researcher (or any other persona in the security field), wanted to see what prior works are available around bypassing v8 sandbox using webasm, or if what’s been done or found targeting deserialization in Go. Using this web app, you can search the indexed and tagged write ups. Also adding MCP support to it so your agents can search too. Hopefully going live soon. P.S: I said HN-like, but tbh it’s just the UI that looks a bit like HN (I’m not a good designer, so got heavy inspiration from HN listing style), otherwise there’s no other overlap in functionality yet. reply",

Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

          "text": "Here's an analysis of your codebase by Claude Opus 4.6 and Kimi 2.5 -- I don't code in Rust or GTK so I can't vouch for how spot on this is but I hope it's not too far off the mark and helps you improve your code. (Claude is wrapping both analyses together.) Strong agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  - Panicking error handling — both flag unwrap()/expect() on fallible operations (secrets, HTTP client, GStreamer). Kimi specifically calls out get_stream_uri returning String instead of Result, which I missed — good      \n  catch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  - Excessive cloning — both note the Jellyfin client and string cloning. Kimi's phrasing (\"host.to_string() on every request construction\") is more specific than mine.\n  - Application struct overloaded — both agree it holds too many responsibilities. Kimi suggests splitting into LibraryService, PlaybackService, etc. I focused more on the RefCell exposure.\n  - Silent error suppression — both flag let _ = sender.send(...) and unwrap_or_default() patterns.\n  - Code duplication in UI — both identify the repetitive list/detail/sorter patterns. Kimi specifically calls out call_on_visible_page widget comparisons, which I grouped under the broader \"5+ copies of factory setup\"\n  observation.\n  - Missing HTTP timeouts — Kimi flags this explicitly. I noted it indirectly via the buffer_unordered without timeout, but Kimi is clearer.\n\n  Things Kimi caught that I didn't emphasise\n\n  - get_stream_uri returning String instead of Result — a genuine API design issue I glossed over.\n  - String-based signal names being error-prone with no compile-time checking — fair point, though it's idiomatic GTK4/Rust.\n  - glycin potentially unused — I didn't check dependency usage.\n  - Position polling not accounting for seeks — a practical UX observation I missed.\n  - /proc/sys/kernel/hostname read being cached in OnceLock — Kimi approves the caching but notes it could be done once at startup. Minor but valid.\n\n  Things I caught that Kimi missed\n\n  - Actual bugs — queue reorder off-by-one, playlist DnD index error, toast format string \"HTTP {} error\" never substituted, double-wrapped Result in stream_info.rs, reversed comment in shuffle logic. These are concrete\n  defects, not just style issues.\n  - Concurrency issues in depth — the Cell<bool> shuffle state race, futures::Mutex inside glib::spawn_future_local deadlock risk, queue mutation race between remove_all() and extend_from_slice().\n  - Signal handler accumulation on widget reuse in ListView factories — a slow memory leak.\n  - Main-thread blocking from synchronous library filtering in detail views.\n  - Image cache with no eviction — unbounded disk growth.\n  - bytes_to_texture panicking inside a Result-returning function — defeats the entire error contract. reply",

You can graphically explore arguments, track their logical sufficiency/necessity, and make counterpoints. It's different than other types of argument theory that just have points \"in favor\" and \"against\" because of how it tries to propagate logical truth and provability. reply",

A while back I've switched to a more modern stack and have fully abandoned WordPress.

As a result, I started a service to help business owners break free from WordPress on to a more modern Next.js-powered stack that's faster, lighter weight, and easier for them to manage.

          "text": "I love making games, and I’ve been building a no-code game engine by extracting reusable components every time I ship a new game. It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform. Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.\nFor game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1]. Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2]. Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4. Nothing is locked in. The engine/editor is at https://craftmygame.com if anyone wants to poke around! And you can test a games here[3][4], and 1 multiplayer game I've tested IRL in a bar [4]!

          "text": "So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales). Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors. I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too. Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions! reply",

That said, if you're talking about models you can actually use on a single regular computer that costs less than a new home, the current crop of open models are very capable but also have noticeable limitations. Small models will always have limitations in terms of capability and especially knowledge. Improved training data and training regiment can squeeze out more from the same number of weights, but there is a limit. So with that in mind, I think such a question only makes sense when talking about specific tasks, like creative writing, data extraction from text, answering knowledge questions, refactoring code, writing greenfield code, etc. In some of these areas the smaller open models are very good and not that far behind. In other areas they are lagging much more, due to their inherent limitations. reply",

I've only had it a couple of months, but so far it's proving its worth in the quality of LLM output, even quantized. I generally run Qwen3-vl at 235b, at a Q4_K_M quantization level so that it fits, and it leaves me plenty of RAM for workstation tasks while delivering tokens at around 30tok/s The smaller Qwen3 models (like qwen3-coder) I use in tandem, of course they run much faster and I tend to run them at higher quants up to Q8 for quality purposes. The gigantic RAM's biggest boon, I've found, is letting me run the models with full context allocated, which lets me hand them larger and more complicated things than I could before.  This alone makes the money I spent worth it, IMO. I did manage to get glm-4.7 (a 358b model) running at a Q3 quantization level; it's delivery is adequate quality-wise, although it delivers at 15tok/s, though I did have to cut down to only 128k context to leave me enough room for the desktop. If you get something this big, it's a powerhouse, but not nearly as much of a powerhouse as a dedicated nVidia GPU rig.  The point is to be able to run them _adequately_, not at production speeds, to get your work done.  I found price/performance/energy usage to be compelling at this level and I am very satisfied. reply",

It's usable with opencode and crush, though my main motivation for getting it was specifically to be able to process personal data (e.g. emails) privately, and to experiment freely with abliterated models for security research. Also, I appreciate being able to run it off solar power. I'm still trying to figure out a good solution for fast external storage, I only went for 1TB internal which doesn't go very far with models that have hundreds of billions of parameters. reply",

          "text": "I have a maxed out M3 Ultra. It runs quantized large open Chinese models pretty well. It's slow-ish, but since I don't use them very frequently, most of the time is waiting to the model to load from disk to RAM. There are benchmarks on token generation speed out there for some of the large models. You can probably guess the speed for models you're interested in by comparing the sizes (mostly look at the active params). Currently the main issue for M1-M4 is the prompt \"preprocessing\" speed. In practical terms, if you have a very long prompt, it's going to take a much long time to process it.  IIRC it's due to lack of efficient matrix multiplication operations in the hardware, which I hear is rectified in the M5 architecture. So if you need to process long prompts, don't count on the Mac Studio, at least not with large models. So in short, if your prompts are relatively short (eg. a couple thousand tokens at most), you need/want a large model, you don't need too much scale/speed, and you need to run inference locally, then Macs are a reasonable option. For me personally, I got my M3 Ultra somewhat due to geopolitical issues. I'm barred from accessing some of the SOTA models from the US due to where I live, and sometimes the Chinese models are not conveniently accessible either. With the hardware, they can pry DeepSeek R1, Kimi-K2, etc. from my cold dead hands lol. reply",

          "text": "I went looking for the latest line of apple computers after reading this thread and I noticed they force you into the higher CPU's in order to get the higher amounts of unified memory. So not only are they content charging +$400 or +$600 for RAM which in itself ludicrously overpriced, they force you to upgrade +$1000-2000 on the top CPU's. Its impossible to spec a macbook pro or a mac mini with a base CPU and a decent amount of RAM. Total scam since they know people want the RAM to use with local LLMs. This was not always the case - When I specced out my macbook pro M1 16gb it was entirely possible to get 32 and 64gb without any tie-in to CPU upgrades. I was ready to drop a few grand on a new macbook pro M5 or M4 pro with a decent amount of RAM but it's currently set up to be an insane price gouge. To get 32GB of RAM it's an M5 chip price $1999. To get 64GB of RAM you are forced to to grab the M4 max CPU, and it's $3,899 on apple right now. What a scam. reply",

It should be 60-75F beautiful sunny days until the day I die. Insane politics? I’ll live 2800 miles away around hippies and liberals. I don’t need to watch the news. Things getting expensive? Make more money so it doesn’t affect me. People are suffering everywhere? Dawg I’m suffering too, so I’ll believe in something irrational so it doesn’t affect me. Maybe not what you wanted to hear. But I’m a realist and wasted a few years of my life trying to think of those things. Ultimately, it’s not worth it. I’ll support things that make sense and I don’t eat meat or drive a gas guzzler.

HN is often around the early majority of the Innovation Adoption curve. I was actually going to ask why Clawdbot wasn't even mentioned on HN when it had been everywhere else... but the news did hit the front page a few days later. There's a few killer updates from the AI coding groups which only get 0-2 upvotes and disappear. HN is not the place to go to be up to date on AI, it's where you go to see the news that has hit the mainstream. Opus 4.6 was \"leaked\" on media and hyped as if it were Claude 5 or something.

          "text": "Not a full team adoption story, but relevant data point: I run a small engineering org (~40 engineers across teams) and we've been tracking AI coding tool adoption informally. The split is roughly: 30% all-in (Claude Code or Cursor for everything), 50% selective users (use it for boilerplate, tests, docs but still hand-write core logic), 20% holdouts. What I've noticed on PR velocity: it went up initially, then plateaued. The PRs got bigger, which means reviews take longer. We actually had to introduce a \"max diff size\" policy because AI-assisted PRs were becoming 800+ line monsters that nobody could review meaningfully. The quality concern that keeps coming up: security. AI-generated code tends to take shortcuts on auth, input validation, error handling. We've started running dedicated security scans specifically tuned for patterns that AI likes to produce. That's been the biggest process change. Net effect: probably 20-30% faster on feature delivery, but we're spending more time on review and security validation than before. reply",

          "text": "\"Confidently wrong\" is the perfect description. The code compiles, the tests pass (because the AI also wrote the tests to match), and the auth flow looks reasonable at first glance. For catching these we layer a few things: - Standard SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL) catches the obvious stuff but misses AI-specific patterns\n- npm audit / pip-audit for dependency issues, especially non-existent packages the AI hallucinates\n- Custom rules tuned for patterns we keep seeing: overly permissive CORS, missing rate limiting, auth checks that look correct but have subtle logic bugs\n- Manual review with a specific checklist for AI-generated code (different from our normal review checklist) You're right that current tooling has a gap. Traditional scanners assume human-written code patterns. AI code looks structurally different - it tends to be more verbose but miss edge cases in ways humans wouldn't. We've been experimenting with scanning approaches specifically tuned for AI output. The biggest wins have been simple: requiring all AI-generated auth and input validation code to go through a dedicated security reviewer, not just a regular code review. reply",

Companies, including startups, come to us with broken systems and spaghetti code and architecture caused by weak prompts, unclear requirements, and no verification. It is important to understand that the efficiency gains we are seeing do not come from the tools alone. They come from a specific combination: 1) Engineers who have spent 20 years building everything from robotics to enterprise-scale technology. You cannot give a perfect instruction to an AI if you do not know what perfect looks like in a production environment. 2) A technical prompt should not be treated as a quick input or question. It is a detailed specification that requires experience and deliberate thinking. 3) Knowing the right combination of tools, workflows, and validation processes. That said, some (many?) members of our team are dinosaurs in the software engineering world. They bring a ton of experience but are used to tools from 15 years ago and don't like change. We really had to push AI adoption (mostly Cursor and Claude Code) on them. It’s still an ongoing process, and probably will be for a while. reply",

          "text": "I was on a greenfield project late last year with a team that was very enthusiastic about coding agents. I would personally call it a failure, and the project is quietly being wound down after only a few months. It went in a few stages: At first, it proceeded very quickly. Using agents, the team were able to generate a lot of code very fast, and so they were checking off requirements at an amazing pace. PRs were rubber stamped, and I found myself arguing with copy/pasted answers from an agent most of the time I tried to offer feedback. As the components started to get more integrated, things started breaking. At first these were obvious things with easy fixes, like some code calling other code with wrong arguments, and the coding agents could handle those. But a lot of the code was written in the overly-defensive style agents were fond of, so there were a lot more subtle errors. Things like the agent adding code to substitute an invalid default value in instead of erroring out, far away from where that value was causing other errors. At this point, the agents started making things strictly worse because they couldn't fit that much code in their context. Instead of actually fixing bugs, they'd catch any exceptions and substitute in more defaults. There was some manual work by some engineers to remove a lot of the defensive code, but they could not keep up with the agents. This is also about when the team discovered that most of the tests were effectively \"assert true\" because they mocked out so much. We did ship the project, but it shipped in an incredibly buggy state, and also the performance was terrible. And, as I said, it's now being wound down. That's probably the right thing to do because it would be easier to restart from scratch than try to make sense of the mess we ended up with. Agents were used to write the documentation, and very little of it is comprehensible. We did screw some things up. People were so enthusiastic about agents, and they produced so much code so fast, that code reviews were essentially non-existent. Instead of taking action on feedback in the reviews, a lot of the time there was some LLM-generated \"won't do\" response that sounded plausible enough that it could convince managers that the reviewers were slowing things down. We also didn't explicitly figure out things like how error-handling or logging should work ahead of time, and so what the agents did was all over the place depending on what was in their context. Maybe the whole mess was a necessary learning as we figure out these new ways of working. Personally I'm still using the coding agents, but very selectively to \"fill-in-the-blanks\" on code where I know what it should look like, but don't need to write it all by hand myself. reply",

          "text": "I'd speculate we had a few factors working against us that made us hit the \"limit\" sooner. Several different engineering teams from different parts of the company had to come together for this, and the overall architecture was modular, so there was a lot of complexity before we had to start integrating. We have some company-wide standards and conventions, but they don't cover everything. To work on the code, you might need to know module A does something one way and module B does it in a different way because different teams were involved. That was implicit in how human engineers worked on it, and so it wasn't explicitly explained to the coding agents. The project was in the life sciences space, and the quality of code in the training data has to be worse than something like a B2B SaaS app. A lot of code in the domain is written by scientists, not software engineers, and only needs to work long enough to publish the paper. So any code an LLM writes is going to look like that by default unless an engineer is paying attention. I don't know that either of those would be insurmountable if the company were willing to burn more tokens, but I'd guess it's an order of magnitude more than we spent already. There are politics as well. There have been other changes in the company, and it seems like the current leadership wants to free up resources to work on completely different things, so there's no will to throw more tokens at untangling the mess. I don't disbelieve the success stories, but I think most of them are either at the level of following already successful patterns instead of doing much novel, or from companies with much bigger budgets for inference. If Anthropic burns a bunch of money to make a C compiler, they can make it back from increased investor hype, but most companies are not in that position. reply",

          "text": "As someone that has already had to \"rescue\" several of those oft-praised \"AI-first\" projects you hear all about, I can safely say this: \"It's not going super well.\" The LLM-produced code I've seen thus far (from moderate feature PRs up to and including entire services), tends twords 'too large' or 'too complex' to properly vet by their small team of creators; PRs against existing codebases are often riddled with minor, seemingly unrelated changes or worse: large and/or subtle test suite alterations that \"all pass\" but contain hidden assumptions in conflict with reality and your business requirements. Numerous edge cases go entirely missed, overly trivial things are validated instead, etc. Feedback loops with the system certainly improves output but is frustrating and in many cases no faster than just writing the code yourself. At this stage you still need a human in the loop, unless you're still in the earliest stages of building a product.  This being HN I'm sure someone around here is employing LLMs successfully in those cases, but the story for established orgs tends to be more complex, especially in traditionally risk averse fields like healthcare, billing, credit card processing, defense, etc. All fields I've worked in. The sheer amount of code these LLM systems produce in aggregate means that we have a deficit of cognitive spoons across our orgs to properly review and test all these changes that are being pumped out. In other words: more bugs end up getting found in the field instead of earlier because we're allowing our generators to validate themselves due to resource constraints. Can we produce code faster than ever before? Sure, but that was never the real bottleneck to begin with, at least in the orgs that I've operated within the past 2 decades. To me, every new line of code needs an inherent justification for its existence.  Code is often as much a liability as it  is an asset. Think on several axis like risk of security vulnerabilities or cognitive load limits when no one left in your org understands your vibe-coded system anymore, as it grows more unwieldy by the day. The business value of new code being introduced should outway its (not so) hidden cost of maintenance and risk of business disruption. With today's emphasis on using LLM output for \"moving faster\", we seem to be ignoring that critical risk/reward analysis and operating under the incorrect assumption that more code is universally a good thing. So for the moment I'm just using LLMs for \"rubber ducking\" or spitballing/testing out ideas before committing to a course of action; an action that will ultimately get executed by a human in the short term at least. That said, on a good day my AI can serve as a proxy for a semi-competent software engineer (with amnesia), and no worse than an actual rubber duck on the others.

          "text": "Yes, the two are very different in that regard. WireGuard is 4k LoC and is very intentional about its choice of using a single, static crypto implementation to drastically reduce its complexity. Technically speaking, it has a lower attack surface for that reason. That said, I've been on your side of the argument before, and practically speaking you can expose OpenSSH on the public internet with a proper key setup and almost certainly nothing will happen because it's a highly-audited, proven piece of software. Even though it's technically very complex. But , that still doesn't mean it isn't best practice to avoid exposing it to the public internet. Especially when you can put things in front of it (such as WireGuard) that have a much lower technical complexity, and thus a reduced attack surface. reply",

          "text": "No, they are not. Doesn’t matter how many LoC; it only take 1 LoC to introduce a vulnerability. Wireguard is a protocol. So what implementation is “very intentional about its choice of …”? Are you talking about my own WG client implementation? Or the one made by this other Chinese vendor? I don’t care what software we are talking about, or who made it. All software has a risk of undiscovered/-disclosed vulnerabilities already existing, or when new ones introduced with an update. If you really want to make this argument we can talk about the implementing organisations SDLC, including SW supply chain, and compare those. But back to the OP/point above: its false to state that one piece of software has a “principle risk” of vulnerabilities that another piece does not. At least, not when both are internet exposed and accepting incoming data. Lasty remember that I never disagreed with you point that a VPN solution is often a better solution, but that was never what I was arguing about. Simply that all code always has a risk of vulnerabilities. No piece of software is excempt from that. reply",

That's like the third or fourth time you've scare-quoted the word principle . You're aware that principle and principal are two different words with different meanings? The word I used, principal , in that context means the foremost or primary risk. Anyways, I'm just telling you how major corporations think about it.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been using Claude Code this evening and I’m very dismayed by Opus 4.6’s ability to follow instructions. I have given it very clear instructions on several points, only to discover it ignored me without telling me.<p>When I asked it for a list of things that deviated from the spec, it told me everything was as expected. Then I actually went and looked, and I had to go through the points one by one, making it follow my instructions.<p>When I confronted it about this, it told me:<p>&gt; I kept second-guessing your design decisions instead of implementing what you asked for … the mistakes I made weren’t a model capability issue - I understood your instructions fine and chose to deviate from them.<p>This is not acceptable. Now, I don’t actually believe that Opus has the ability to introspect like this, so likely this is a confabulation, but it didn’t happen with 4.5. Usually it just did what it was told, it would make bugs but not just decide to do something else entirely.<p>I want a model that actually does what I tell it. I don’t see anything online about how to get 4.5 back.<p>Any help?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "In my opinion, Opus 4.6 handles instructions (especially negative rules) better than Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5. It also applies skills better than other models. But I think this is individual. Another example. I asked gpt-5.2-codex to add an array of 5 values to the script and write a small piece of code. Then I manually deleted one of the values in the array and asked the agent to commit.\nBut the model edited the file again and added the value I deleted to the array.\nI deleted that value again and asked the agent to “just commit.” But the agent edited the file again before committing.\nThis happened many times, and I used different commands, such as “never edit the file, just commit.” The model responded that it understood the command and began editing the file. I switched to gpt-5.2, but that didn't help. I switched to sonnet-4.5, and it immediately committed on the first try without editing the file. reply",

          "text": "GPT-5 used to do this on release, but seems to have reverted back, especially on the codex versions. This may well be a feature. I joked that this is the side effect of asking it to act like a senior software engineer. It tends to talk back and do its own thing. There was that one time when the thought processes went \"I'm a full stack engineer\" > \"I'm expanding my connections on LinkedIn\" > \"I'm establishing myself as a tech writer\" > \"I'm evaluating classes in professional writing\". It does have introspection capabilities, but one could argue it's just a bug or emergent. Anyway, option 1: why not just use Sonnet? Heck you can use Haiku if you're giving it clear instructions. The thinking ones do perform worse on clear tasks. You also get your rolled back version. Option 2: Use role prompting [0]\nGive it some junior engineer role where it's expected to follow instructions exactly as given.

          "text": "This is how BigCo works. They are optimized for resilience and providing predictable cashflows for investors, not efficiency as such. If they had, say, 2 \"10x\" engineers who were brilliant and could do everything with no red tape or inefficiency, then one or both of them could leave, or demand pay raises, and the company would be screwed - it would be a very brittle, unsustainable period of efficiency. So, it's better to have 20 1x engineers, with significant slack in the system, who are all interchangeable cogs in a machine that takes tickets in one end and pushes mediocre software out the other end. That way, if 5 or 10 of them leave, they can be replaced, and nobody will tell the difference. If there's a lean quarter, you can lay off half of them, and then rehire a bunch of average randos off the street a few months later, and again, nobody will be able to tell the difference. Also, the mayor will visit the grand opening of the new office, and the media will write a lovely story about how many jobs have been \"created\", and the company will be able to negotiate some tax breaks for creating so many mediocre jobs. You might find things are better at a mom & pop, or startup, or maybe outside of a big city. reply",

          "text": "So I work for a small defense contractor, for more than 2 years now. The means to success so far is almost entirely in the soft skills. It’s helpful to understand the technology but the soft skills are so much more important. It’s certainly the 80/20 rule. Here is what I mean by soft skills: * Actually caring about people. Checking up on your peers and seeing if they need help. * Constant awareness of the people under your management. Having some idea of what they are working on where their pain points are. They should always know they can come to you if they have a problem. * Tracking down undocumented requirements by actually talking to people and getting to know more people. * Constant awareness of hot issues affecting major projects and operating status. Since my business is technology contracting the business goal is to put people into employment and retain those people to the success of the client. The more I retain people the more successful I am to my employer. The inefficiency of the work is up to the client and coordinating business partners. I started here as a developer and within a year was promoted to a manager. In the contract I am still a developer. The complexity there is that I operate in partnership with an another company who would prefer I were a junior developer even though I manage 15 seats. It’s still all about the soft skills. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We're a YC W23 company building AI agents for engineering labs - our customers run similar analyses repeatedly, and the agent treated every session like a blank slate.<p>We looked at Mem0, Letta/MemGPT, and similar memory solutions. They all solve a different problem: storing facts from conversations — \"user prefers Python,\" \"user is vegetarian.\" That's key-value memory with semantic search. Useful, but not what we needed.<p>What we needed was something that learns user patterns implicitly from behavior over time. When a customer corrects a threshold from 85% to 80% three sessions in a row, the agent should just know that next time. When a team always re-runs with stricter filters, the system should pick up on that pattern.\nSo we built an internal API around a simple idea: user corrections are the highest-signal data. Instead of ingesting chat messages and hoping an LLM extracts something, we capture structured events — what the agent produced, what the user changed, what they accepted. A background job periodically runs an LLM pass to extract patterns and builds a confidence-weighted preference profile per user/team/org.<p>Before each session, the agent fetches the profile and gets smarter over time.\nThe gap as I see it:<p>Mem0 = memory storage + retrieval. Doesn't learn patterns.<p>Letta = self-editing agent memory. Closer, but no implicit learning from behavior.<p>Missing = a preference learning layer that watches how users interact with agents and builds an evolving model. Like a rec engine for agent personalization.<p>I built this for our domain but the approach is domain-agnostic. Curious if others are hitting the same wall with their agents. Happy to share the architecture, prompts, and confidence scoring approach in detail.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

In general, the “chat history mining” sector seems to be way under-developed to me so far. All the damn time I am annoyed I have to re-tell my LLM a piece of info I have already told it a few weeks ago - finding the chat takes too long and the full history may not be relevant, but the fact wasn’t interesting enough to manually add to memory. With the right memory system, the LLM could just know! Does anyone have other interesting examples of this principle being applied? reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Title basically tries to capture the gist of the  question. I have been asked (volunteer) to assist in the project of migration from a proprietary, more costly CRM solution, to an Odoo Community \"product\", to be architected, configured, deployed in a cloud service and operated by a specialized partner. My specialization is in infrastructure (architecture, ops and security), so I could certainly validate mapping the apps functionality into the right components, but I have zero knowledge on how good the CRM part is, and - crucially - how to keep its possible need for customization in time and operations cost low, if internal org volunteers have no technical skills. I am concerned about the integrator attempt to get the foot in the door with an acceptable one time cost, then slowly ramp up the price, if this solution requires a lot of babysitting.<p>Does anyone have any experience with this Odoo Community CRM product and model, to share some gotchas, in the light of the above described attempt to use? Users max 300. The hope is to also have the CRM integrate with needed office products (doc, spreadsheet, email, etc.)</p></div>",

          "text": "I've implemented Odoo Community for a few small orgs and it's solid for nonprofits if you have the technical resources to maintain it. The main gotchas are: it requires significant PostgreSQL knowledge for customizations, the upgrade path between major versions can be painful (especially with custom modules), and while the community edition is free, you'll likely need paid modules for advanced CRM features like email marketing automation. Since you mentioned migration - the data import process is where most projects get stuck. Odoo's import tools are decent but you'll probably need custom Python scripts for complex data transformations from your current CRM. One thing I learned while building automation tools is that many small nonprofits actually need something simpler than a full CRM - often they just need better task management and follow-up tracking from their existing email communications. I've been beta testing ungrind.ai which handles that specific piece (auto-creates tasks from emails/meetings), though it's designed more for individual consultants than organizations. What's your current CRM and roughly how many contacts/complexity are you migrating? That would help determine if Odoo Community's data model limitations might be an issue. reply",

By the time someone lands on your site, the most important decision may have already happened upstream and you have no idea. The UTM case you mentioned is a good example: it only captures direct \"AI to site\" clicks, but misses scenarios where AI influences the decision indirectly (brand mention to later search to visit). From the site’s perspective tho... yeah it looks indistinguishable from organic search. It makes me wonder whether we’ll need a completely new mental model for attribution here. Perhaps less about “what query drove this visit” and more about “where did trust originate.” Not sure what the right solution is yet, but it feels like we’re flying blind during a pretty major shift in how people discover things. reply",

I'm struggling to find the motivation to write up my notes (neurodiversity both helping me see the problem and stopping me do anything about it).  I'm struggling to name  the theory. I am struggling ( with some limited success) in noticing what I do differently. I'm also struggling with recovering from a major burnout from succeeding creating highly motivated teams in really tough organisations. I thought all along that I would be better with a collaborator watching me and noting the differences between what I do and what everyone else is doing, then interviewing me about it. Maybe I could publish bits of it, little tidbits of blogs (who would find them?) or social media videos (I really don't want to have to record and edit videos). Not sure how to get progress. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for taking a moment to reply. Firstly, I have met very few malicious people in my career. Most of the really destructive people are products of their environments. It is complicated,  but it is normally an incentives problem, most commonly status/ power rather than monetary. Often they have created blocking processes that the company sees as some sort of control or policing. It tends to be rather easy to change that if you are their boss . It is harder, but not impossible as a colleague. Often the application of cold hard rigorous logic,  an understanding of the real controls etc. Can unstick them. I work in a 100k person company at the moment (admittedly I'm not in charge of that many of them), so I understand the problem of scale, but I would counter that the changes neede are rather subtle. I think much can be achieved by focusing on the 20 people at the top. Culture cascades. For example if you dig in over a KPI not being achieved, when someone explains that it is counterproductive, or conflicts with another KPI,  how do you think they will manage their team in future? reply",

Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

Readers get wild gadgets, sneaky pranks, and fast chases—plus the chance to ask what they would do if adults tried to control every thought in their head.

Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

I guess you can imagine it as creating paths for the electrons to flow! I do like the ease of visually drawing schematics, however for some parts of circuit design, it gets repetitive and the GUI (used Altium, Allegro and Kicad professionally) gets in the way. For more complex circuit changes, it can be much easier to diff text rather than graphics, since text can capture intent better. reply",

I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

          "text": "I recently retired after 37 years of working in tech so of course I am working on open source. My retirement treat was to spend three months learning OpenGL and 3D game programming by porting a classic Java RTS game, Tribal Trouble, to more modern OpenGL and Java. I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. ( https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble ) For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. ( https://wireshark.org ) I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun. reply",

It's been growing steadily with a community of ~1,400 subscribers on YouTube and paying users. What I'm most excited about right now is DB Pro Studio: a collaborative web-based version I'm building on top of it. The idea is simple: databases are a team activity, but every DB tool treats them as a single-player experience. Studio adds either a self-hosted or managed hosted data browser, real-time collaboration, dashboards, visual workflow automation, and enterprise features like audit logging and role-based access. Think \"database command center\" where your whole team can inspect, query, and build on your data together. The desktop app acts as the execution engine (your data never leaves your infrastructure), while Studio provides the shared dashboard layer. I've also consistently posted devlogs on YT throughout the journey, which has helped build a community of ~1,400 subscribers who've shaped the product along the way. Site: https://dbpro.app YouTube: https://youtube.com/@dbproapp Would love feedback from anyone who's felt the pain of sharing database context across a team. reply",

It seems like the model is massively weighted on code written using spaces (duh). Despite having a very well articulated styleguide (that Codex helped me write after examining my codebase!) that clearly specifies that tabs are used for indentation, the model will happily go off and make a bunch of changes that incorporate spaces seemingly at random. It will use tabs correctly in certain places, but then devolve back to using spaces later on in the same files.<p>I have a linter that I've taught the model to run to catch these things, but A) that feels like such a waste of tokens and B) the model often forgets to run the linter anyway.<p>It's like having a junior developer who has never used the tab key before. They remember to ctrl-f their spaces-&gt;tabs sometimes before opening a PR, but not all the time. So I wind up giving them the same feedback over and over.<p>This example -- tabs instead of spaces -- is just one specific case where the model seems to invariably converge on a local maximum that is dictated by the center of the software bell curve. But in general I'm finding it to be true of just about any \"quirky\" style opinion I want to enforce:<p>- Avoid Typescript's `any` or `unknown`: the model will still happily throw these in to make the compiler happy<p>- Avoid complex ternaries: nope, the model loves these<p>- Avoid inscrutable one-letter variables versus longer, self-descriptive ones: nope, `a` it is<p>It just seems like I'm using a tool that is really good at producing the average software output by the average software developer. It's not able to keep my aesthetic / architectural desires at the front of its thinking as it's making my desired changes. It's as if I hired the guy from Memento as an intern.<p>How do people get around this, other than slathering on even more admonitions to use tabs no matter what (thereby wasting valuable tokens)?<p>Beyond syntax, I'm still able to use the models to crudely implement new features or functionality, but the way they write code feels... inelegant. There's often a single unifying insight within grasp that the model could reach for to greatly simplify the code it wrote for a given task, but it's not able to see it without me telling it that it's there.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There are exceptions to ever rule, but generally patents are (1) not incredibly important in software (2) solving a question that's secondary. The biggest risk to building a startup isn't \"can I build this thing\" (feasibility risk). It's \"will people even care if I build this thing\" (value risk) then \"can I do it in a way people use\" (usability risk).  Patents help solve business risk, but that's generally considered to be the 4th (and last) of the risks. There are exceptions where patents do need to be filed first or the business viability dies. However, I generally assume that if you've addressed value, usability, and feasibility risks to create something truly meaningful, your competitors will find a work around to deliver the same value, usability, and feasibility without infringing on your patent. Thus, patents, are nothing but a minor inconvenience. In some cases, the public filing of a patent, can give your competitors a leg up on competing with you. https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/ reply",

          "text": "If you're in the US, look into relevant court cases[0][1][2]. The courts tend to hold that algorithms are not patentable - what is patentable would be an invented machine which uses a software algorithm as one of its components. But even then, the machine needs to have some other inventive, patentable physical component. (This sort of thing tend to confuse people since, the US patent office doesn't check for patent validity before granting patents. So there are a lot of companies that own invalid patents which have simply never been challenged in court.) If you live elsewhere you should look into the laws of your local jurisdiction, but many places have the same or similar legal doctrine.

          "text": "I am!  I moved from a shoebox Linux workstation with 32MB of RAM and a 12GB RTX 3060 to a 256GB M3 Ultra, mainly for unified memory. I've only had it a couple of months, but so far it's proving its worth in the quality of LLM output, even quantized. I generally run Qwen3-vl at 235b, at a Q4_K_M quantization level so that it fits, and it leaves me plenty of RAM for workstation tasks while delivering tokens at around 30tok/s The smaller Qwen3 models (like qwen3-coder) I use in tandem, of course they run much faster and I tend to run them at higher quants up to Q8 for quality purposes. The gigantic RAM's biggest boon, I've found, is letting me run the models with full context allocated, which lets me hand them larger and more complicated things than I could before.  This alone makes the money I spent worth it, IMO. I did manage to get glm-4.7 (a 358b model) running at a Q3 quantization level; it's delivery is adequate quality-wise, although it delivers at 15tok/s, though I did have to cut down to only 128k context to leave me enough room for the desktop. If you get something this big, it's a powerhouse, but not nearly as much of a powerhouse as a dedicated nVidia GPU rig.  The point is to be able to run them _adequately_, not at production speeds, to get your work done.  I found price/performance/energy usage to be compelling at this level and I am very satisfied. reply",

Later I'm gonna use my own custom local LLM system on the Mac Studio, probably orchestrated by LangChain and running models with llama.cpp. My goal has all the time been to use them in ensembles in order to reduce model biases. The same principle has just now been introduced as a feature called \"model council\" in Perplexity Max: https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-model-council Chats will be stored in and recalled from a PostgreSQL database with extensions for vectors (pgvector) and graph (Apache AGE).

          "text": "I have a maxed out M3 Ultra. It runs quantized large open Chinese models pretty well. It's slow-ish, but since I don't use them very frequently, most of the time is waiting to the model to load from disk to RAM. There are benchmarks on token generation speed out there for some of the large models. You can probably guess the speed for models you're interested in by comparing the sizes (mostly look at the active params). Currently the main issue for M1-M4 is the prompt \"preprocessing\" speed. In practical terms, if you have a very long prompt, it's going to take a much long time to process it.  IIRC it's due to lack of efficient matrix multiplication operations in the hardware, which I hear is rectified in the M5 architecture. So if you need to process long prompts, don't count on the Mac Studio, at least not with large models. So in short, if your prompts are relatively short (eg. a couple thousand tokens at most), you need/want a large model, you don't need too much scale/speed, and you need to run inference locally, then Macs are a reasonable option. For me personally, I got my M3 Ultra somewhat due to geopolitical issues. I'm barred from accessing some of the SOTA models from the US due to where I live, and sometimes the Chinese models are not conveniently accessible either. With the hardware, they can pry DeepSeek R1, Kimi-K2, etc. from my cold dead hands lol. reply",

So not only are they content charging +$400 or +$600 for RAM which in itself ludicrously overpriced, they force you to upgrade +$1000-2000 on the top CPU's. Its impossible to spec a macbook pro or a mac mini with a base CPU and a decent amount of RAM. Total scam since they know people want the RAM to use with local LLMs. This was not always the case - When I specced out my macbook pro M1 16gb it was entirely possible to get 32 and 64gb without any tie-in to CPU upgrades. I was ready to drop a few grand on a new macbook pro M5 or M4 pro with a decent amount of RAM but it's currently set up to be an insane price gouge. To get 32GB of RAM it's an M5 chip price $1999. To get 64GB of RAM you are forced to to grab the M4 max CPU, and it's $3,899 on apple right now. What a scam. reply",

It should be 60-75F beautiful sunny days until the day I die. Insane politics? I’ll live 2800 miles away around hippies and liberals. I don’t need to watch the news. Things getting expensive? Make more money so it doesn’t affect me. People are suffering everywhere? Dawg I’m suffering too, so I’ll believe in something irrational so it doesn’t affect me. Maybe not what you wanted to hear. But I’m a realist and wasted a few years of my life trying to think of those things. Ultimately, it’s not worth it. I’ll support things that make sense and I don’t eat meat or drive a gas guzzler. What more do you want? When you ask  your titular question you’re already in a minority of the population. Many people continue to make dumbass decisions that affect everyone else in negative ways.

          "text": "A local model is an open model you run locally, so I'm not entirely sure the distinction in the question makes sense. That said, if you're talking about models you can actually use on a single regular computer that costs less than a new home, the current crop of open models are very capable but also have noticeable limitations. Small models will always have limitations in terms of capability and especially knowledge. Improved training data and training regiment can squeeze out more from the same number of weights, but there is a limit. So with that in mind, I think such a question only makes sense when talking about specific tasks, like creative writing, data extraction from text, answering knowledge questions, refactoring code, writing greenfield code, etc. In some of these areas the smaller open models are very good and not that far behind. In other areas they are lagging much more, due to their inherent limitations. reply",

Or you like a post by the anti-AI folks and your feed is now on how useless or harmful it is. With HN, we all see the same news. But now it's far to the extreme of either party. HN is often around the early majority of the Innovation Adoption curve. I was actually going to ask why Clawdbot wasn't even mentioned on HN when it had been everywhere else... but the news did hit the front page a few days later. There's a few killer updates from the AI coding groups which only get 0-2 upvotes and disappear. HN is not the place to go to be up to date on AI, it's where you go to see the news that has hit the mainstream. Opus 4.6 was \"leaked\" on media and hyped as if it were Claude 5 or something. By the time the news was actually out, people had formed their opinions. reply",

          "text": "Not a full team adoption story, but relevant data point: I run a small engineering org (~40 engineers across teams) and we've been tracking AI coding tool adoption informally. The split is roughly: 30% all-in (Claude Code or Cursor for everything), 50% selective users (use it for boilerplate, tests, docs but still hand-write core logic), 20% holdouts. What I've noticed on PR velocity: it went up initially, then plateaued. The PRs got bigger, which means reviews take longer. We actually had to introduce a \"max diff size\" policy because AI-assisted PRs were becoming 800+ line monsters that nobody could review meaningfully. The quality concern that keeps coming up: security. AI-generated code tends to take shortcuts on auth, input validation, error handling. We've started running dedicated security scans specifically tuned for patterns that AI likes to produce. That's been the biggest process change. Net effect: probably 20-30% faster on feature delivery, but we're spending more time on review and security validation than before. reply",

          "text": "\"Confidently wrong\" is the perfect description. The code compiles, the tests pass (because the AI also wrote the tests to match), and the auth flow looks reasonable at first glance. For catching these we layer a few things: - Standard SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL) catches the obvious stuff but misses AI-specific patterns\n- npm audit / pip-audit for dependency issues, especially non-existent packages the AI hallucinates\n- Custom rules tuned for patterns we keep seeing: overly permissive CORS, missing rate limiting, auth checks that look correct but have subtle logic bugs\n- Manual review with a specific checklist for AI-generated code (different from our normal review checklist) You're right that current tooling has a gap. Traditional scanners assume human-written code patterns. AI code looks structurally different - it tends to be more verbose but miss edge cases in ways humans wouldn't. We've been experimenting with scanning approaches specifically tuned for AI output. The biggest wins have been simple: requiring all AI-generated auth and input validation code to go through a dedicated security reviewer, not just a regular code review. reply",

They are not the norm, yet. But they demonstrate what is possible. We have also seen what happens when things go wrong. Companies, including startups, come to us with broken systems and spaghetti code and architecture caused by weak prompts, unclear requirements, and no verification. It is important to understand that the efficiency gains we are seeing do not come from the tools alone. They come from a specific combination: 1) Engineers who have spent 20 years building everything from robotics to enterprise-scale technology. You cannot give a perfect instruction to an AI if you do not know what perfect looks like in a production environment. 2) A technical prompt should not be treated as a quick input or question. It is a detailed specification that requires experience and deliberate thinking. 3) Knowing the right combination of tools, workflows, and validation processes. That said, some (many?) members of our team are dinosaurs in the software engineering world. They bring a ton of experience but are used to tools from 15 years ago and don't like change. We really had to push AI adoption (mostly Cursor and Claude Code) on them. It’s still an ongoing process, and probably will be for a while. reply",

          "text": "I was on a greenfield project late last year with a team that was very enthusiastic about coding agents. I would personally call it a failure, and the project is quietly being wound down after only a few months. It went in a few stages: At first, it proceeded very quickly. Using agents, the team were able to generate a lot of code very fast, and so they were checking off requirements at an amazing pace. PRs were rubber stamped, and I found myself arguing with copy/pasted answers from an agent most of the time I tried to offer feedback. As the components started to get more integrated, things started breaking. At first these were obvious things with easy fixes, like some code calling other code with wrong arguments, and the coding agents could handle those. But a lot of the code was written in the overly-defensive style agents were fond of, so there were a lot more subtle errors. Things like the agent adding code to substitute an invalid default value in instead of erroring out, far away from where that value was causing other errors. At this point, the agents started making things strictly worse because they couldn't fit that much code in their context. Instead of actually fixing bugs, they'd catch any exceptions and substitute in more defaults. There was some manual work by some engineers to remove a lot of the defensive code, but they could not keep up with the agents. This is also about when the team discovered that most of the tests were effectively \"assert true\" because they mocked out so much. We did ship the project, but it shipped in an incredibly buggy state, and also the performance was terrible. And, as I said, it's now being wound down. That's probably the right thing to do because it would be easier to restart from scratch than try to make sense of the mess we ended up with. Agents were used to write the documentation, and very little of it is comprehensible. We did screw some things up. People were so enthusiastic about agents, and they produced so much code so fast, that code reviews were essentially non-existent. Instead of taking action on feedback in the reviews, a lot of the time there was some LLM-generated \"won't do\" response that sounded plausible enough that it could convince managers that the reviewers were slowing things down. We also didn't explicitly figure out things like how error-handling or logging should work ahead of time, and so what the agents did was all over the place depending on what was in their context. Maybe the whole mess was a necessary learning as we figure out these new ways of working. Personally I'm still using the coding agents, but very selectively to \"fill-in-the-blanks\" on code where I know what it should look like, but don't need to write it all by hand myself. reply",

          "text": "I'd speculate we had a few factors working against us that made us hit the \"limit\" sooner. Several different engineering teams from different parts of the company had to come together for this, and the overall architecture was modular, so there was a lot of complexity before we had to start integrating. We have some company-wide standards and conventions, but they don't cover everything. To work on the code, you might need to know module A does something one way and module B does it in a different way because different teams were involved. That was implicit in how human engineers worked on it, and so it wasn't explicitly explained to the coding agents. The project was in the life sciences space, and the quality of code in the training data has to be worse than something like a B2B SaaS app. A lot of code in the domain is written by scientists, not software engineers, and only needs to work long enough to publish the paper. So any code an LLM writes is going to look like that by default unless an engineer is paying attention. I don't know that either of those would be insurmountable if the company were willing to burn more tokens, but I'd guess it's an order of magnitude more than we spent already. There are politics as well. There have been other changes in the company, and it seems like the current leadership wants to free up resources to work on completely different things, so there's no will to throw more tokens at untangling the mess. I don't disbelieve the success stories, but I think most of them are either at the level of following already successful patterns instead of doing much novel, or from companies with much bigger budgets for inference. If Anthropic burns a bunch of money to make a C compiler, they can make it back from increased investor hype, but most companies are not in that position. reply",

          "text": "As someone that has already had to \"rescue\" several of those oft-praised \"AI-first\" projects you hear all about, I can safely say this: \"It's not going super well.\" The LLM-produced code I've seen thus far (from moderate feature PRs up to and including entire services), tends twords 'too large' or 'too complex' to properly vet by their small team of creators; PRs against existing codebases are often riddled with minor, seemingly unrelated changes or worse: large and/or subtle test suite alterations that \"all pass\" but contain hidden assumptions in conflict with reality and your business requirements. Numerous edge cases go entirely missed, overly trivial things are validated instead, etc. Feedback loops with the system certainly improves output but is frustrating and in many cases no faster than just writing the code yourself. At this stage you still need a human in the loop, unless you're still in the earliest stages of building a product.  This being HN I'm sure someone around here is employing LLMs successfully in those cases, but the story for established orgs tends to be more complex, especially in traditionally risk averse fields like healthcare, billing, credit card processing, defense, etc. All fields I've worked in. The sheer amount of code these LLM systems produce in aggregate means that we have a deficit of cognitive spoons across our orgs to properly review and test all these changes that are being pumped out. In other words: more bugs end up getting found in the field instead of earlier because we're allowing our generators to validate themselves due to resource constraints. Can we produce code faster than ever before? Sure, but that was never the real bottleneck to begin with, at least in the orgs that I've operated within the past 2 decades. To me, every new line of code needs an inherent justification for its existence.  Code is often as much a liability as it  is an asset. Think on several axis like risk of security vulnerabilities or cognitive load limits when no one left in your org understands your vibe-coded system anymore, as it grows more unwieldy by the day. The business value of new code being introduced should outway its (not so) hidden cost of maintenance and risk of business disruption. With today's emphasis on using LLM output for \"moving faster\", we seem to be ignoring that critical risk/reward analysis and operating under the incorrect assumption that more code is universally a good thing. So for the moment I'm just using LLMs for \"rubber ducking\" or spitballing/testing out ideas before committing to a course of action; an action that will ultimately get executed by a human in the short term at least. That said, on a good day my AI can serve as a proxy for a semi-competent software engineer (with amnesia), and no worse than an actual rubber duck on the others.

Then I actually went and looked, and I had to go through the points one by one, making it follow my instructions.<p>When I confronted it about this, it told me:<p>&gt; I kept second-guessing your design decisions instead of implementing what you asked for … the mistakes I made weren’t a model capability issue - I understood your instructions fine and chose to deviate from them.<p>This is not acceptable. Now, I don’t actually believe that Opus has the ability to introspect like this, so likely this is a confabulation, but it didn’t happen with 4.5. Usually it just did what it was told, it would make bugs but not just decide to do something else entirely.<p>I want a model that actually does what I tell it.

Then I manually deleted one of the values in the array and asked the agent to commit.\nBut the model edited the file again and added the value I deleted to the array.\nI deleted that value again and asked the agent to “just commit.” But the agent edited the file again before committing.\nThis happened many times, and I used different commands, such as “never edit the file, just commit.” The model responded that it understood the command and began editing the file. I switched to gpt-5.2, but that didn't help. I switched to sonnet-4.5, and it immediately committed on the first try without editing the file. reply",

          "text": "This is how BigCo works. They are optimized for resilience and providing predictable cashflows for investors, not efficiency as such. If they had, say, 2 \"10x\" engineers who were brilliant and could do everything with no red tape or inefficiency, then one or both of them could leave, or demand pay raises, and the company would be screwed - it would be a very brittle, unsustainable period of efficiency. So, it's better to have 20 1x engineers, with significant slack in the system, who are all interchangeable cogs in a machine that takes tickets in one end and pushes mediocre software out the other end. That way, if 5 or 10 of them leave, they can be replaced, and nobody will tell the difference. If there's a lean quarter, you can lay off half of them, and then rehire a bunch of average randos off the street a few months later, and again, nobody will be able to tell the difference. Also, the mayor will visit the grand opening of the new office, and the media will write a lovely story about how many jobs have been \"created\", and the company will be able to negotiate some tax breaks for creating so many mediocre jobs. You might find things are better at a mom & pop, or startup, or maybe outside of a big city. reply",

          "text": "So I work for a small defense contractor, for more than 2 years now. The means to success so far is almost entirely in the soft skills. It’s helpful to understand the technology but the soft skills are so much more important. It’s certainly the 80/20 rule. Here is what I mean by soft skills: * Actually caring about people. Checking up on your peers and seeing if they need help. * Constant awareness of the people under your management. Having some idea of what they are working on where their pain points are. They should always know they can come to you if they have a problem. * Tracking down undocumented requirements by actually talking to people and getting to know more people. * Constant awareness of hot issues affecting major projects and operating status. Since my business is technology contracting the business goal is to put people into employment and retain those people to the success of the client. The more I retain people the more successful I am to my employer. The inefficiency of the work is up to the client and coordinating business partners. I started here as a developer and within a year was promoted to a manager. In the contract I am still a developer. The complexity there is that I operate in partnership with an another company who would prefer I were a junior developer even though I manage 15 seats. It’s still all about the soft skills. reply",

What’s strange is that we’re moving into a world where recommendations matter more than a click, but attribution still assumes a traditional search funnel. By the time someone lands on your site, the most important decision may have already happened upstream and you have no idea. The UTM case you mentioned is a good example: it only captures direct \"AI to site\" clicks, but misses scenarios where AI influences the decision indirectly (brand mention to later search to visit). From the site’s perspective tho... yeah it looks indistinguishable from organic search. It makes me wonder whether we’ll need a completely new mental model for attribution here. Perhaps less about “what query drove this visit” and more about “where did trust originate.” Not sure what the right solution is yet, but it feels like we’re flying blind during a pretty major shift in how people discover things. reply",

          "text": "Right there with you because SEO has evolved to a place that incentivizes a lot of bad behavior, and the end result made search worse for everyone. I’m personally less interested in “gaming” LLMs than understanding what they already do. From my side, this feels closer to observability than optimization when trying to see whether AI systems are even reading or understanding a site, not how to trick them into ranking something low quality. The Raymond Chen analogy brings up something interesting. If everyone forces themselves on top, the signal collapses. My hope is that AI systems end up rewarding genuinely useful, well explained things rather than creating another arms race...but I’m not naive about how incentives tend to play out. A huge concern of mine has been the introduction of ads. Once ads enter LLM responses, it’s hard not to ask whether we’re just rebuilding the same incentive structure that broke search in the first place. reply",

          "text": "This is why the saying has always been “reduce, reuse, recycle” in that order. Reducing is the best. Don’t buy or make surplus stuff, and that reduces waste overall. Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible. Installing Linux on an old laptop to keep it useful for somebody is easy to do, and much more effective than trying to recycle it. reply",

          "text": "Recycling works best when you have a big lump of bulk material which can be melted down and reforged/recast. Aluminum cans are some of the best objects for recycling because apart from the labels they are almost pure aluminum, and so you just toss them in a furnace and get the constituent material back. Electronics are the exact opposite of this: they’re highly heterogenous, with bits of material scattered all over the place. Also, most of that material isn’t particularly valuable: silicon is literally as abundant as sand. So all you can really do is melt it all into slag or dissolve it in acid and then try to extract the trace amounts of valuable bits like gold, but this is so energy-intensive for so little material that it’s not worth it at any reasonable material price. reply",

Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

I'll be sharing this with some friends who could really use this. | Stao | - The website says it's open source, but I couldn't find a link to the source repo.

Initially the idea was more of a game-like-app, and then it made sense to use flutter. Now though, its not really game-like and couldve just as well been native (apart for me not bothering doing it twice).

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

It's a EU-based Kagi [2] alternative (privacy-focused and ad-free search with domain boosting/exclusion rules). We've been using it with friends and family semi-successfully (hashbangs work for edge cases we're still working on). It's really difficult to get bigger indexes other than Mojeek and Marginalia to want to work with us and improve the results further, so that's something I've been researching more, lately. EUSP (the new Ecosia/Qwant-effort-related index) has finally replied to me last week, but I'm still waiting on an API key. If you're interested in trying it for a few days and are a human, reach out with your account number and I'll give you a couple of weeks for free. We're pushing improvements daily.

Now he has to out-hack teachers, drones, and a traitor friend using only his brain, his DIY skills, and the outlaw Mesh. Readers get wild gadgets, sneaky pranks, and fast chases—plus the chance to ask what they would do if adults tried to control every thought in their head. Final edits from the editor are arriving this week - then I'm off to find a lit agent, hopefully get a publishing deal by the end of 2026.

          "text": "I'm working on https://laboratory.love Laboratory.love lets you fund independent plastic chemical lab testing of the specific foods you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

          "text": "Very nice, ran well in a VM on my home NAS. I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

Vibe coding signifies a lack of control over one's own code and generally only if it's to generate ideas or throwaway. The negative connotation that goes with it is appropriate too. In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a new theory of management. I was explaining leadership to someone and they said I should write a book about it. In the same week I was explaining another aspect and got the same response.  I think management has been overcomplicated by people trying to codify it. I think MBAs and systems like EOS try to dumb everyone down to inhuman lowest-common-denominator robots. That is the main cause of the productivity crisis. That's why people leave their jobs, and magically find they are 100% more productive without a boss. No BS, and they are inspired. I think you could get further faster by being a human, being inspiring, being a leader. I think you could learn more from Nelson than whatever nasty dehumanising theory most bosses have been reading. I'm struggling to find the motivation to write up my notes (neurodiversity both helping me see the problem and stopping me do anything about it).  I'm struggling to name  the theory. I am struggling ( with some limited success) in noticing what I do differently. I'm also struggling with recovering from a major burnout from succeeding creating highly motivated teams in really tough organisations. I thought all along that I would be better with a collaborator watching me and noting the differences between what I do and what everyone else is doing, then interviewing me about it. Maybe I could publish bits of it, little tidbits of blogs (who would find them?) or social media videos (I really don't want to have to record and edit videos). Not sure how to get progress. reply",

It is complicated,  but it is normally an incentives problem, most commonly status/ power rather than monetary. Often they have created blocking processes that the company sees as some sort of control or policing. It tends to be rather easy to change that if you are their boss . It is harder, but not impossible as a colleague. Often the application of cold hard rigorous logic,  an understanding of the real controls etc. Can unstick them. I work in a 100k person company at the moment (admittedly I'm not in charge of that many of them), so I understand the problem of scale, but I would counter that the changes neede are rather subtle. I think much can be achieved by focusing on the 20 people at the top. Culture cascades. For example if you dig in over a KPI not being achieved, when someone explains that it is counterproductive, or conflicts with another KPI,  how do you think they will manage their team in future? reply",

Honestly, your perspective feels a little out of touch.

In my experience, most \"leadership\" is about maximizing the leader's personal gain.

The \"currency\" is often based on perception of what the leader likes. My suggestion here is instead focus on actual dollars and cents. Does the sub-org bring in more than they spend?

I left one job and the cleaner sent an apology for not being able to say goodbye, since she was off. She didn't work for me in any way.  Why? Because I talked to her, and listened to her. Last week someone had a tough time who works for someone,  who works for someone who works for me. I went and sat with them for a couple of hours. I don't know everyone's name at the coal face,  there are hundreds, but I know what they do and ask them about it. If their area has made an improvement, I go and see it, and say well done. I saw someone limping down the stairs one day,  I asked them what happened. When I saw them walking well the following week I remarked on it. They stopped and chatted for a few minutes,  then told me all about a problem with one of our systems. It confirmed what I thought. Every time those conversations happen they tell me a bit about what is going on in the real world. I'm careful not to criticise, and to use the info against anyone. I get my tea from the main canteen on the other side of the campus so I bump into people, not just managers. When I get asked to approve spend,  I write and ask if I can visit the area so I can understand. If I support it I write to the next person in the approval chain (if there is one after me) and tell them why. I take my team to visit people in other departments,  and introduce the other person,  and explain what they do,  so they know I know. I'm famous for having the longest ever tour of one of our sites,  because I asked so many questions about the technology,  and spoke to every one I met.

I can tell you in US corporate IT organizations where I have worked, there's very little cross-mingling. Leaders may be sent on visits to other orgs that are often planned/staged rather than spontaneous. I'm glad you take an interest. Good leaders often do. In my personal experience, that behavior is atypical. Myself I have never had to more than 1 layer between me and individual contributors and prefer it that way. When I do speak to middle managers, their goals are to avoid causing waves while finding their niche, mostly by ingratiating themselves to some person two levels up and gain enough aforementioned \"currency\" to advance to the next level. They produce headlines and nothing much of measurable and durable value. A few companies have elaborate internal accounting and review org P/L that way. IBM did in the 90's (not sure if now). AMZN may have some kind of internal recharge model from what I've heard. Most companies just have \"budgets\"  though the allocations rarely have any bearing on any actual or perceived fiscal  benefit. Disclaimer: This is an N=1 opinion.

          "text": "> In my personal experience, that behavior is atypical. Absolutely it is. I am atypical. My atypical behaviour gets results.  That is the point of wanting to write about it! I think you got in a bit deep with the currency thing. People try to show they are doing what the boss wants, that is where we agreed.   Unfortunately that is often behaviour that is negative for other people and the team, and I suggest the company as a whole. Imagine I set a KPI that I want x lines of code per person. A manager will stop being impressed by the team member who refactors pages of nonsense into 1 line, he wants bulk.  The best member of the team gets disheartened and leaves. I set a bad KPI, but I also set an expectation that the KPI mattered to me,  and therefore meeting it at all costs was what the manager needed to do. This is the currency you described. Remove the KPI and just take a 'measurement' of lines of code.  Next time I meet with the manager he proudly states his team created x lines of code. I ask why. I ask what areas needed more code. I ask what improved. I ask if the code is more stable,  needs what resources etc. I ask how the lines of code moved us towards our goals.  Do these lines of code make us money? How? Now the manager sees that I value them not as a stick-bearer, but someone I require to be intellectually engaged in the work their team is doing, and able to summarise that effort so I can run a bigger team. I made the currency based on positive factors. KPIs are a lazy attempt at management. Others asked about scalability. It is perfectly scalable.  If I was the CEO, the questions I ask the CTO are what shows them what I value, the currency if you will.  If I am lazy at that, I  will generate lazy behaviour. Measuring anything is fine, but measurement has a cost and you need to be intellectually honest that it is only part of the picture, and your real interest should be what made the measure move,  and what does that tell you. I could measure the number of features added,  for instance,  but I need to understand how hard each feature is and hours much value they add. Same when my PM suggests a new feature, I should interrogate them about why, talk about the cost of maintaining it. I should ask them to weigh that against the fact that our biggest customer is complaining about down time and speed, an incidentally they are not interested in that feature. You see what we did? We made it clear that I value intellectual rigor in peoples decision making,  and understanding of what it is we sell. I created a currency that is more positive than being cocky, good at PowerPoint and meeting KPIs. You are correct that I'm not in the US, but I have twice worked for US headquartered firms,  so I have some insight into how they work. I would say they have informed my view that they tend to fail at motivating people,  and especially motivating them to do the right things. I'm actually not good at traditional corporate climbing.  My PowerPoints deliberately have few words on them,  because I concentrate on speaking. I also have a bad habit of saying inconvenient truths outloud . I am deliberately exluded from lots of meetings where I might reveal how little they know. I get promoted because just sometimes they need someone to actually get the work done that the company sells. I'm contained and restricted though. reply",

          "text": "Yes, that is the excuse I read for a recent accounting scandal at a listed company. However, it is a weak one. Yes their incentives have slipped from long-term shareholder value to short-term share price,  and the market loves to be irrational...especially about AI and Musk. Except only some of the market does,  and the incentive can be met in other ways. Most capital is less worried about how you run the company than the returns. They worry about fundamentals, ROCE etc. If you have too much inventory,  then yes you will get pushback. But encouraging your employees to be creative won't get you in trouble. This is just an excuse. I mean,  being polite to your employees, having dedicated inspired staff, won't hurt your share price. I think assholes getting to be CEO is a symptom of a failing meritocracy, bad career development,  focus on loyalty over ability. I think it harms the share price by lowering productivity. But capital is conservative. Board members are chosen from a tiny select group of people who have done it before,  or at least sent to the right elite schools. When I worked in PE, the biggest thing I learnt was that PE partners (as a whole) know very little about running businesses. They only know about balance sheet fundamentals,  and whether you answer their questions convincingly. They were specialists in the pissing contests, but could be easily fobbed off if your ratios were good and you met your forecast. Imitating their behavior inside the company is a choice, not an inevitability. Sorry,  a bit 'stream of consciousness' rather than a well argued response,  but you seem smart enough to see what I mean. reply",

Yes, leadership could do the right thing, but the right thing is difficult to measure by shareholders and can only grasped by shareholders until it is too late (Disney for example), but why would they? I agree, people are not malicious but the system currently selects for people that ignore the difficult to measure right thing to do (in SWE it’s doing the grunt platform work that no one will appreciate) and skip to things that are rewarded (cool feature tm that users hate by gives a cool slide to the CEO), it might seem like people can do both but it’s not in practice due to having limited energy. Also stream of thought answer, but I feel like we are back to the trust thing, the right thing to do is impossible to measure, so we can only hope they do it because they care about doing the right thing, but incentives punishes them and makes them scarce at the top and the only solution is to go back to a high trust society (maybe like Japan where CEOs care and the incentives are set so people are often doing the right thing). reply",

I suppose my biggest takeaway,  is that all I know right now,  is every time I was given a dysfunctional department to look after it got better very quickly, both according to staff, colleagues and my seniors.  I don't know exactly why,  and would love an outside observer, but I have my theories. I'm loath to put bits of it out there because you get a couple of categories of negative response. 1) 'That is just obvious'. All of my best work ever was obvious to everyone afterwards ! 2) You are naive. It would never work in x company. You give people too much credit etc. Yet here I am,  unexpectedly at home feeling ill, with 100% confidence that everyone in my extended team is coping just fine, doing as much work as if I was there, and getting along with each other. The only message I got today was one asking how I am. Meanwhile my colleague mangers will be answering emails while on holiday, because their world would fall apart without them. Again, this is why an outside observer would be so useful,  they could testify to the results as well as the methodology. reply",

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

          "text": "I recently retired after 37 years of working in tech so of course I am working on open source. My retirement treat was to spend three months learning OpenGL and 3D game programming by porting a classic Java RTS game, Tribal Trouble, to more modern OpenGL and Java. I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. ( https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble ) For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. ( https://wireshark.org ) I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun. reply",

I wonder how much OpenGL/LWJGL code there is. It could maybe run in the browser with CheerpJ or TeaVM if that code could be ported to WebGL. My labor of love is SnapCode: https://reportmill.com/SnapCode . It has a small interface (camera + vertex buffer) that can run on either desktop or in browser.

          "text": "Some are placing their bets and hoping to win big, some are just having fun and exploring the new technology and most are probably like me and have found those few areas that the technology works for them and ignores everything else. It is a fairly amazing technology, as a humanities sort that has no clue when it comes to programming but also has some things I want to make, LLMs are invaluable and not in the sense that they can write them for me—I am not capable enough in programming to get them to do what I want—but in the sense they can present things in a way a humanities sort can understand so I can write those programs I want. A recent prompt of mine: >Write a dialogue where H.P. Lovecraft and David Foster Wallace are tasked with developing a DSL for audio synthesis and composition, they are trying to sell each other on their preferred language, Lovecraft wants rust, Wallace Zig. Their discussion should be deeper than just the talking points and include code examples. Thomas Pynchon is also there, he is a junior dev and enamored with C, he occasionally interjects into the discussion and generally fails to follow the discussion but somehow manages to make salient points; Lovecraft never address Pynchon or C but alludes to the horror, Wallace tries to include and encourage Pynchon but mostly ignores him. I pretty much knew how ChatGPT would use each of them; Lovecraft would view everything other than rust as some lurking unnameable horror, Pynchon would seem random and nonsensical, and Wallace would vainly attempt to explore all options without weighing in, and that is exactly what happened. Being able to get this sort of information within contexts I understand is amazing, 15 or 20 minutes later I had more direction than I ever had before and it answered a dozen or so language agnostic questions I had regarding implementing such a DSL which is really what I was after. And it gave me some good laughs. A year ago I thought these projects would never move beyond being ideas, when ever I tried to get help from people they just told me what I was doing wrong and tried to send me down the path of their ideals, how they think things should be done, which was probably more a failure on my part than theirs with my being a humanities sort and incompetent programmer. LLMs have infinite patience and time, those people who I sought help from in the past were not completely wrong but they did try to lead me down a wrong path for what ever reason, partially because they don't have infinite time and patience but also because they thought they were right. Henry James has been walking me through the PureData source code this past week. Everyone is not hyping AI/LLM, that is just the bias of tech communities and the like, most of us see it about the same as we see a blender or toaster. Can't remember the last time AI/LLMs came up in general conversation for me. reply",

          "text": "There are exceptions to ever rule, but generally patents are (1) not incredibly important in software (2) solving a question that's secondary. The biggest risk to building a startup isn't \"can I build this thing\" (feasibility risk). It's \"will people even care if I build this thing\" (value risk) then \"can I do it in a way people use\" (usability risk).  Patents help solve business risk, but that's generally considered to be the 4th (and last) of the risks. There are exceptions where patents do need to be filed first or the business viability dies. However, I generally assume that if you've addressed value, usability, and feasibility risks to create something truly meaningful, your competitors will find a work around to deliver the same value, usability, and feasibility without infringing on your patent. Thus, patents, are nothing but a minor inconvenience. In some cases, the public filing of a patent, can give your competitors a leg up on competing with you. https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/ reply",

          "text": "Go read The Founder's Dilemma by Wasserman. It's great and covers almost any problem a founder will run into. To really summarize, it's all about trade offs and prioritization. Patents vs trade secrets fits nicely. Trade secrets are far cheaper and easier to maintain than patents. In short, patents are only as strong as your ability to enforce them. Also Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014) weakened software and process patents. That said, if you can’t realistically defend IP in court, you effectively don’t have it. From an early-stage founder perspective, that makes patents a questionable use of time and money and potentially what kills the company. This may contrast from information you get from a lawyer or VC. Patents are attractive because they create an asset someone else can later buy or defend. For the founder, the incentives aren’t squarely aligned. Neither approach is more right or wrong, but there are very real practical consequences. If you are pre-seed who is bootstrapped or done a family & friends round and are pre or early revenue, trade secrecy is by far your better option. As an additional note, if you don't own the underlying AI models and are just a better wrapper for Claude or ChatGPT you at best have a very weak IP or patent position. reply",

          "text": "If you're in the US, look into relevant court cases[0][1][2]. The courts tend to hold that algorithms are not patentable - what is patentable would be an invented machine which uses a software algorithm as one of its components. But even then, the machine needs to have some other inventive, patentable physical component. (This sort of thing tend to confuse people since, the US patent office doesn't check for patent validity before granting patents. So there are a lot of companies that own invalid patents which have simply never been challenged in court.) If you live elsewhere you should look into the laws of your local jurisdiction, but many places have the same or similar legal doctrine.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been steadfastly trying my best to incorporate the latest-and-greatest models into my workflow. I've been primarily using Codex recently. But I'm still having difficulties.<p>For example: no matter what I do, I can't prevent Codex from introducing linter errors.<p>I use tabs instead of spaces for indentation. It seems like the model is massively weighted on code written using spaces (duh). Despite having a very well articulated styleguide (that Codex helped me write after examining my codebase!) that clearly specifies that tabs are used for indentation, the model will happily go off and make a bunch of changes that incorporate spaces seemingly at random. It will use tabs correctly in certain places, but then devolve back to using spaces later on in the same files.<p>I have a linter that I've taught the model to run to catch these things, but A) that feels like such a waste of tokens and B) the model often forgets to run the linter anyway.<p>It's like having a junior developer who has never used the tab key before. They remember to ctrl-f their spaces-&gt;tabs sometimes before opening a PR, but not all the time. So I wind up giving them the same feedback over and over.<p>This example -- tabs instead of spaces -- is just one specific case where the model seems to invariably converge on a local maximum that is dictated by the center of the software bell curve. But in general I'm finding it to be true of just about any \"quirky\" style opinion I want to enforce:<p>- Avoid Typescript's `any` or `unknown`: the model will still happily throw these in to make the compiler happy<p>- Avoid complex ternaries: nope, the model loves these<p>- Avoid inscrutable one-letter variables versus longer, self-descriptive ones: nope, `a` it is<p>It just seems like I'm using a tool that is really good at producing the average software output by the average software developer. It's not able to keep my aesthetic / architectural desires at the front of its thinking as it's making my desired changes. It's as if I hired the guy from Memento as an intern.<p>How do people get around this, other than slathering on even more admonitions to use tabs no matter what (thereby wasting valuable tokens)?<p>Beyond syntax, I'm still able to use the models to crudely implement new features or functionality, but the way they write code feels... inelegant. There's often a single unifying insight within grasp that the model could reach for to greatly simplify the code it wrote for a given task, but it's not able to see it without me telling it that it's there.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Importantly, I do tell the agents to always run the linters and use the auto-formatters if needed. They get it. Don't make them format code, it's slow. The auto formatters are better and they should use them. I also don't like any or unknown and I have some eslint rules against those, and the agents will notice and fix their code, automatically without being asked. I guess you can also find some linting rules against ternaries, or too short variables. I like eslint-plugin-unicorn for example and I think it has rules for that by default. It's not very different that working with other people. reply",

          "text": "A pre-commit hook that runs a linter and type-checking is absolutely vital to maintain the code formatting of AI generated commits. One observation I’ve made working with LLMs is that sometimes it’s worth being flexible and conforming to the LLM’s code style and patterns. Frankly the code doesn’t need to be elegant or follow arbitrary guidelines (in reality nobody cares if it uses spaces or tabs, what matters is the result). In the past (pre-LLM) I used to nitpick people in code reviews, calling out a bunch of stylistic preferences that I believed would keep the codebase “consistent” and “elegant”. The idea was that if the codebase is uniform it’s easier for other engineers to iterate on it or debug. Today I don’t care in the slightest. I’m not the one writing the code nor am I the one actively debugging it, that has been delegated to the AI. Furthermore very seldom am I actually reading any of the generated code unless it’s mission critical. I treat the code it generates as a black box until I can’t, and nowhere throughout that process do I worry about aesthetics. Try to put aside all code vanity, accept that not all code will be aesthetically pleasing or elegantly written. Focus on delivering the end goal, not the syntactical minutia. reply",

Adding a dimension greatly increases the complexity of the data-processing algorithms the device will be running. reply",

          "text": "A local model is an open model you run locally, so I'm not entirely sure the distinction in the question makes sense. That said, if you're talking about models you can actually use on a single regular computer that costs less than a new home, the current crop of open models are very capable but also have noticeable limitations. Small models will always have limitations in terms of capability and especially knowledge. Improved training data and training regiment can squeeze out more from the same number of weights, but there is a limit. So with that in mind, I think such a question only makes sense when talking about specific tasks, like creative writing, data extraction from text, answering knowledge questions, refactoring code, writing greenfield code, etc. In some of these areas the smaller open models are very good and not that far behind. In other areas they are lagging much more, due to their inherent limitations. reply",

I need your opinion about something.<p>PoeticMetric is on github right now, but because I am not happy with M$ I am moving it (along with everything else I have on github) to a self-hosted forgejo instance. But I am worried that it is going to cause friction for people who might want to contribute (not that it happens too often  but I don't want to discourage that rare kind of people).<p>I didn't enable registrations on forgejo, I don't have time to deal with spam. So using forgejo for issues and pull requests won't work, also even if I enable registrations I think it is too big of a hassle for people to create an account on a separate platform to contribute to a project.<p>What I am thinking of is that, I keep a mirror on github, utilize issues and PRs there. And when a PR is merged, I am going to manually sync the original repository. I am not 100% happy with this because 1. this way I don't totally leave github, 2. the syncing manually is tedious, 3. project's issues history is on github and it is going to be vendor-locked. But I can't think of any better way.<p>The only other way I can think of is that, I can use something like a forum for issues, but again, it is not going cover pull requests.<p>What do you think would work this case?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'm a solo dev building a handful of apps across different niches.. - Kvile ( https://kvile.app ) — A lightweight desktop HTTP client built with Rust + Tauri. Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

Also as a Linux user, I deeply appreciate the linux support :-) A few questions and comments: | Kvile | - Awesome, really happy to see a reasonable take on this (open source, offline-first, no telemetry, no acount, etc).  Do you think at some point you'll try to monetize it in some way? - Looks like build assets didn't get attached for the latest release (v0.2.1) in Github: https://github.com/tskulbru/kvile/releases/tag/kvile-v0.2.1 | Mockingjay | - Awesome, definitely a valuable project.  I'll be sharing this with some friends who could really use this. | Stao | - The website says it's open source, but I couldn't find a link to the source repo.  I looked at your github repos and didn't see it in there either. - Great idea!  I'm so bad about forgetting to stand so something like this could be super useful. reply",

Hopefully this might help others the way it did for our family. The app is built using flutter because im going to release it on Android too very soon, and I couldnt be bothered creating it twice. Initially the idea was more of a game-like-app, and then it made sense to use flutter. Now though, its not really game-like and couldve just as well been native (apart for me not bothering doing it twice). If i wouldve done it again from scratch, for this app, i would still have chosen flutter. reply",

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

Over the last 10 years I've been automating kubernetes cloud environments and no matter what company I end up working at, eventually they all want the same. Easy deployments and -not- having a degree in Kubernetes knowledge to run their apps. In addition there's a growing amount of people/companies wanting to move away from US-owned cloud providers (the big three), so I figured, I'll combine everything. Easy to create deployments on whatever cloud with a focus on being able to migrate from one provider to the other. The more I'm working on it, the more ideas I keep getting and wanting to add to the platform. I would really appreciate feedback from anyone no matter how big or small the criticism! reply",

It's a EU-based Kagi [2] alternative (privacy-focused and ad-free search with domain boosting/exclusion rules). We've been using it with friends and family semi-successfully (hashbangs work for edge cases we're still working on). It's really difficult to get bigger indexes other than Mojeek and Marginalia to want to work with us and improve the results further, so that's something I've been researching more, lately. EUSP (the new Ecosia/Qwant-effort-related index) has finally replied to me last week, but I'm still waiting on an API key. If you're interested in trying it for a few days and are a human, reach out with your account number and I'll give you a couple of weeks for free. We're pushing improvements daily.

Now he has to out-hack teachers, drones, and a traitor friend using only his brain, his DIY skills, and the outlaw Mesh. Readers get wild gadgets, sneaky pranks, and fast chases—plus the chance to ask what they would do if adults tried to control every thought in their head. Final edits from the editor are arriving this week - then I'm off to find a lit agent, hopefully get a publishing deal by the end of 2026.

          "text": "Very nice, ran well in a VM on my home NAS. I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

Vibe coding signifies a lack of control over one's own code and generally only if it's to generate ideas or throwaway. The negative connotation that goes with it is appropriate too. In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?) That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments. reply",

The second error was that none of us had production level experience with Neo4J apart from what you just said, tinkering in toy projects at home or very low stakes services, so in the end, the schema that was created was a bit of a mess, you would look at it and say \"well, it makes sense...\" but in reality we were treating Neo4J as a twisted NoSQL/SQL interpretation. The third mistake was treating Neo4J as a database meant to handle realtime requests from thousands of users doing filtering and depending on huge responses from external systems (VERY OLD systems, we're talking IBM AS400 old) while in an environment where each response depended on at least 2 or 3 microservices. We had one cypher query to handle almost all use cases, you can imagine what a behemoth that was. In the end as I said, compound error between lack of experience, not analyzing correctly our needs and a \"just go with it attitude\" that to this day I'm pretty sure it cost quite a bit to the company.

Electronics today use plastics and special metals, and extracting them isn't straightforward, because requires energy and big acid digestors.<p>Is there some kind of initiative on this area, on using other materials or designing chips and boards to be more recyclable or reusable?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is why the saying has always been “reduce, reuse, recycle” in that order. Reducing is the best. Don’t buy or make surplus stuff, and that reduces waste overall. Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible. Installing Linux on an old laptop to keep it useful for somebody is easy to do, and much more effective than trying to recycle it. reply",

          "text": "In addition to the volume issue, there's the composition issue.  When I was a kid, we recycled all our flint cores.  Well, not quite that far back...  Milk came in glass bottles, and the person who delivered the bottles of milk to our house picked up the empties to take back to the dairy.  There were also steel cans for canned food and soft drinks (which eventually rusts away), and of course lots of other glass bottles.  Now more and more of those kinds of things come in plastic, of which little gets recycled.  And cans are often aluminum, which doesn't rust away. Furniture was wood and fabric and (maybe) springs, with a little bit of pressboard (which was itself recycled paper and textile, usually used on the back of desks etc.).  Now furniture is particleboard (made from sawdust), with lots of glue and some kind of plastic veneer if it's in a place that shows.  Wood is genuinely recyclable (or re-usable as antiques!); I don't think particleboard is recyclable, although I could be wrong. Automobiles were steel, fabric, glass and copper wire (with rubber insulation); plus of course rubber tires.  Now they are those things plus a lot more plastic.  Tires, both then and now, are essentially un-recyclable (although occasionally turned into artificial reefs). I could go on, but there are probably more authoritative (= better) studies of this.  But I suspect in general that we have lots less recyclable \"stuff\" these days than we used to. reply",

          "text": "The ultimate reason is there isn't economic reason so.  It cost's a lot to recycle anything, and most electronics would net you almost nothing valuable. Let's look at an example.  Let's say your phones main board, which will net a few hundred grams of raw materials.  First thing by weight the actual board itself is probably the biggest,  if you could perfectly decompose it to it's parts you would have some fiberglass, glue, a few grams of copper, and maybe a trace amount of gold. Next you would have the different components, mostly ICs but let's cover them next.  These are mostly plastic with bits of copper, tin, and other more exotic metals. Most of these could be used again, if you can separate them and sort them.  There would be a bunch of solder, which maybe could be reused, if you remix it with more flux.  Finally, you'll have chips, these could be reused, but only as replacements for the same chip.  Getting anything out of these would mostly be removing the bulk of the material which is silicon that's been contaminated with other elements to make the semiconductors.  I don't think there is any process right now that could take doped Si and get you anything back.  Besides the silicon you have micrograms of gold and other conductors. Having put all that down, I think there could be an opportunity to take the bulk components off boards, test and sort them, and sell them in bulk. reply",

Something that's mostly impossible unless it's mandated and people decide that trash is unacceptable or at least needs to be greatly minimized. Thinking about it, maybe at some point disposal cost will become so expensive that people won't buy new items unless sellers pay for trashing them. reply",

Many times the only viable option to fix something is to swap a board, or replace the entire item, instead of replacing the one failed component that caused the board to fail, or reflowing the board etc.. Many components also do not offer batteries that can be replaced, such as the magic mouse, so you end up needing to replace the entire item. It's interesting how as certain things age, such as cars, cottage industries pop up to do just that when new replacement boards and parts are not available. The other issue is cost cutting. Many components are made cheaply and fail pre-maturely. Great examples of this are mains voltage LED bulbs where the rectifier circuits that power the LED's fail, but the only real option is to replace the entire thing, creating a lot of e-waste in the process. reply",

I can't think of any number that you could pick that wouldn't either be ineffective, or cause unintended effects.

I think we're better off lobbying for better standards to communicate the quality of a bulb's design.  The whole reason we have crappy LED bulbs to begin with is because the $3 overdriven bulb with crap components jammed into a tiny enclosure looks like a better deal on the shelf than a bulky $20 bulb with a large heat sink and lower output. And the labor required to do component level repair is wildly expensive and limited (YouTubers who do it on principle notwithstanding), even further narrowing that window. reply",

Not that I think lightbulbs are probably worth saving, but expand it to any other device which gets exponentially more complex and it is easy to see why they don't get diagnosed, not to mention repaired. With a board diagram I can point at a spot on the board and say \"I should see 15 volts here\", without a board diagram i gotta draw out and figure out how the power supply even works so I know what it is suppose to be outputting and then trace that all the way to the test point to make sure there isn't other crap inline before then that might change what I see. reply",

If it is cheap to replace, they will just get a new one.  If it was a big investment, then it's important enough to call a professional to fix.  In the middle ground you've got people who will ask their handy nephew to try to fix it before they run out to the store, and he'll open it up and look for a blown fuse or a loose wire before giving up.  The type of people who can do board level repairs are so rare as to be completely irrelevant to the waste stream of electronics.

Appliance repair use to be big business. Did it stop being so because washers and TVs and vacuums became too complicated to understand, or the parts went up in cost, or because $1000 is considered cheap enough of a device to be considered disposable? No. They stopped existing because appliances stopped coming with the reference materials to repair them in a reasonable time and parts are obfuscated from their source so people don't even know what their broken part is half the time. Is that a thermistor, a capacitor, a diode that blew up? Have fun spending the next 2 hours tracing the obfuscated part number down through 5 different suppliers to figure it out because you obviously can't test a broken part and there is no schematic to look at and identify it from. reply",

Small appliances and electronics are not repaired as any more much because: 1. their real price has cratered over the past 50 years 2. they have more integrated and specialized parts that simply aren’t repairable or available 3. They have fewer mechanical parts prone to regular failure or which pay the bills for repair shops (belts, timers, etc) 4. They are far more complicated than their predecessors, and therefore more complicated to diagnose even if you have a schematic But yeah, when everyone’s washing machine has a belt transmission and a clunky mechanical timer, they failed all the time and there were repair shops on every corner.

In incandescent bulbs, there is a real tradeoff between durability of the bulb, efficiency (lumens/watt), and brightness/quality of the light, for physics reasons you _can't_ improve one without degrading the other. Since \"quality of light\" is a very difficult thing to market, there was an incentive to push \"lifetime of the bulb\" in marketing and just make the light quality increasingly worse. The cartel attempted to halt that by making everyone agree on a lifetime/quality to hit and not participate in a race to the bottom (and yes, there was also the obvious benefit to the cartel members of increased sales and profits, which they explicitly talked about in internal documents). I want to be very clear that I'm anti cartels and I'm not trying to say \"so this was all hunky dory\", just that this was not (and these things very rarely are) a simple case of \"they made the product objectively worse for the sole sake of more money\". Instead, they chose a different point on the pareto-frontier of brightness/efficiency/lifespan that also had the benefit of making them more money. But yes, LED bulbs are currently mostly garbage and have terrible heat/power management electronics which means that in practice you almost never get anywhere close to the theoretical life span increases (because the electronics die from overheating far before the actual LEDs themselves would go out), and finding out information on how well a given bulb brand does on heat/power management is essentially impossible. reply",

          "text": "TechnologyConnections debunked the Phoebus Cartel a while ago. tl;dw incandescent bulbs can be made more efficient and brighter by running them hotter, but this reduces the lifetime. The obvious Nash Equilibrium involves increasingly hot/bright/efficient bulbs and as much lying about lifetime as a typical consumer would accept, which is a lot. The idea behind the Phoebus Cartel was to force honesty on the dimension where it was most likely to disappear. You are free to disapprove of this and reject bulb lifetime policing, but if so you support the \"everybody lies\" alternative. Pick your poison. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been using OpenClaw intensively for about two weeks.<p>The first few days were exciting. It felt like we’re finally getting closer to autonomous agents that can actually operate a computer end-to-end. But after the initial excitement faded, I started noticing some consistent issues:<p>- It frequently stops responding mid-task<p>- Execution fails without clear recovery<p>- Task success rate feels inconsistent and unpredictable<p>- Long-running tasks degrade over time<p>It made me wonder whether the current architecture is fundamentally limiting reliability.<p>Right now, it feels closer to a “single program trying to do everything” model. But if we look at the history of computing, systems only became truly robust when we moved toward operating system–like abstractions:<p>- event-driven execution<p>- proper failure recovery<p>- watchdog / heartbeat monitoring<p>- task supervision trees<p>- state persistence and resumability<p>In other words, less like a script, more like an OS.<p>My current hypothesis is that tools like OpenClaw might need a deeper re-architecture — not just better prompting or incremental patches — but a system-level rethink focused on reliability and scalability from day one.<p>Curious what others think:<p>Is this mainly an engineering maturity issue that will be fixed incrementally?<p>Or is there a more fundamental architectural gap in current agent frameworks?<p>Has anyone tried building agents with more OS-like supervision models?<p>Would love to hear perspectives from people building in this space.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is a great observation. I'm the creator of OpenClaw, and you've hit on exactly why we recently introduced the \"Gateway\" architecture. The early versions were indeed \"single programs trying to do everything,\" which is fine for a demo but fails for long-horizon tasks. The new Gateway architecture (v1.0+) moves us toward the OS model you're describing: 1. Process Supervision: The Gateway acts as a supervisor for multiple agent sessions. If an agent crashes or hangs, the Gateway can detect the heartbeat failure and attempt recovery.\n2. State Persistence: We're moving memory and session state into a decoupled database (Clawdb) so you can restart the process without losing context.\n3. Event-Driven: Sub-agents can now spawn to handle background work and notify the main session via system events, rather than blocking the main loop. We're still early in the transition, but the goal is to make OpenClaw the \"agentic kernel\" that handles the messy reality of failure, rather than just a wrapper around a prompt. Reliability is the main focus for the next few months. reply",

The pattern I see isn’t AI is revolutionary. It’s:\n1) The easy wins are done.\n2) The marginal gains are getting expensive.\n3) The distribution layer is shifting faster than the capability layer. Most new model releases aren’t unlocking fundamentally new workflows. They’re compressing friction in workflows that already work. That’s useful, but not narrative-worthy. The real shift isn’t GPT-5.3 vs GPT-5.2. It’s:\n- AI replacing search as the interface layer.\n- AI compressing junior-level execution work.\n- AI reshaping how products are discovered (AI Overviews, summaries, agents). That doesn’t make MoltBook any less absurd. Burning compute on bots talking to bots is peak theater. But dismissing everything because of the theater might be like dismissing the internet because of Pets.com. We may be at peak hype, but that doesn’t mean the substrate shift isn’t real. The question isn’t, is AI overhyped?\nIt’s, where is durable value forming? That’s harder, and way less viral, to answer. reply",

The Palm Pilot, Google Maps on an early Android phone come to mind. When I began playing around with LLMs, I had my initial aha moment. It was far above either of those for me. So, I think that collective aha moment we've been having the last few years (still) drives a lot of the excitement/hype. If you view 'hype around [x]' as essentially a probability ranking problem, that is, whatever is most likely to give you your next aha moment generates the most hype, at any point in time. There's a decay element, too, if the reality doesn't match the expectations, then other technologies are viewed as more likely to produce that next big aha moment. But for now I think this characterizes AI today more than other technologies. reply",

I can't even find the active HN thread. This was more because people were surprised about the actual owner of ai.com which everyone assumed was OpenAI or Sam Altman or something. > OpenClaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot This has been everywhere elsewhere too, and Clawdbot hit HN a few days late, after people have already set up videos on it. It's a security hole, but it's the first legitimately good automation tool we've had from AI. Moltbook is more fascination with moltbot+MCPs rather than something interesting in itself - it meant you had a tool that could use the internet from a CLI and such.

I love it. It's like a PB&J sandwich. It's cheap. It's the combination of technology people take for granted. It's also something usable in daily life. Opus 4.6 had better parallel command use - meaning it would search for all the files at once instead of 1 at a time. And it was better at going deeper. It helped me pin a bug by going into Android source code and finding the exact line causing a bug, then all the functions that were called by this bug. Most people don't need to look at the source code of the thing they built something on top of, and the people who are vibe coding don't care much for code. Nobody benchmarks how crunchy the peanut butter is. gpt-5.3-codex benchmarked better, but I'm not seeing this translating to useful code. It failed with the first few requests I gave it.

          "text": "Some are placing their bets and hoping to win big, some are just having fun and exploring the new technology and most are probably like me and have found those few areas that the technology works for them and ignores everything else. It is a fairly amazing technology, as a humanities sort that has no clue when it comes to programming but also has some things I want to make, LLMs are invaluable and not in the sense that they can write them for me—I am not capable enough in programming to get them to do what I want—but in the sense they can present things in a way a humanities sort can understand so I can write those programs I want. A recent prompt of mine: >Write a dialogue where H.P. Lovecraft and David Foster Wallace are tasked with developing a DSL for audio synthesis and composition, they are trying to sell each other on their preferred language, Lovecraft wants rust, Wallace Zig. Their discussion should be deeper than just the talking points and include code examples. Thomas Pynchon is also there, he is a junior dev and enamored with C, he occasionally interjects into the discussion and generally fails to follow the discussion but somehow manages to make salient points; Lovecraft never address Pynchon or C but alludes to the horror, Wallace tries to include and encourage Pynchon but mostly ignores him. I pretty much knew how ChatGPT would use each of them; Lovecraft would view everything other than rust as some lurking unnameable horror, Pynchon would seem random and nonsensical, and Wallace would vainly attempt to explore all options without weighing in, and that is exactly what happened. Being able to get this sort of information within contexts I understand is amazing, 15 or 20 minutes later I had more direction than I ever had before and it answered a dozen or so language agnostic questions I had regarding implementing such a DSL which is really what I was after. And it gave me some good laughs. A year ago I thought these projects would never move beyond being ideas, when ever I tried to get help from people they just told me what I was doing wrong and tried to send me down the path of their ideals, how they think things should be done, which was probably more a failure on my part than theirs with my being a humanities sort and incompetent programmer. LLMs have infinite patience and time, those people who I sought help from in the past were not completely wrong but they did try to lead me down a wrong path for what ever reason, partially because they don't have infinite time and patience but also because they thought they were right. Henry James has been walking me through the PureData source code this past week. Everyone is not hyping AI/LLM, that is just the bias of tech communities and the like, most of us see it about the same as we see a blender or toaster. Can't remember the last time AI/LLMs came up in general conversation for me. reply",

          "text": "Solo founder here building B2B SaaS in a niche vertical (accounting automation). My take: your moat at pre-seed isn't IP, it's domain depth. I decided early not to patent anything. Not because our technical approach isn't novel - we have some genuinely interesting pattern matching pipelines - but because the defensibility comes from accumulated domain knowledge that's almost impossible to replicate quickly. We've hand-built logic for 16 different VAT code classifications, edge cases in how platforms handle API fields differently, quirks in how bank statement descriptions vary across hundreds of merchants. None of that is patentable. All of it is incredibly hard to reproduce. A competitor could read a patent filing and build a workaround in months. They can't shortcut two years of discovering that one accounting platform silently ignores a field that every other platform respects, or that merchant descriptions follow completely different patterns at different transaction amounts. The practical concern with provisionals is the 12-month clock. If you file one, you've committed to either converting to a full patent (expensive, time-consuming) or letting it lapse. At pre-seed, that's a decision you're forcing on your future self at potentially the worst possible time. If your \"core technical approaches\" are truly about AI model architecture, that's a different conversation - but if it's mostly about how you apply models to a specific domain, I'd argue your time is better spent going deeper into the domain than drafting patent claims. reply",

          "text": "There are exceptions to ever rule, but generally patents are (1) not incredibly important in software (2) solving a question that's secondary. The biggest risk to building a startup isn't \"can I build this thing\" (feasibility risk). It's \"will people even care if I build this thing\" (value risk) then \"can I do it in a way people use\" (usability risk).  Patents help solve business risk, but that's generally considered to be the 4th (and last) of the risks. There are exceptions where patents do need to be filed first or the business viability dies. However, I generally assume that if you've addressed value, usability, and feasibility risks to create something truly meaningful, your competitors will find a work around to deliver the same value, usability, and feasibility without infringing on your patent. Thus, patents, are nothing but a minor inconvenience. In some cases, the public filing of a patent, can give your competitors a leg up on competing with you. https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/ reply",

          "text": "Go read The Founder's Dilemma by Wasserman. It's great and covers almost any problem a founder will run into. To really summarize, it's all about trade offs and prioritization. Patents vs trade secrets fits nicely. Trade secrets are far cheaper and easier to maintain than patents. In short, patents are only as strong as your ability to enforce them. Also Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014) weakened software and process patents. That said, if you can’t realistically defend IP in court, you effectively don’t have it. From an early-stage founder perspective, that makes patents a questionable use of time and money and potentially what kills the company. This may contrast from information you get from a lawyer or VC. Patents are attractive because they create an asset someone else can later buy or defend. For the founder, the incentives aren’t squarely aligned. Neither approach is more right or wrong, but there are very real practical consequences. If you are pre-seed who is bootstrapped or done a family & friends round and are pre or early revenue, trade secrecy is by far your better option. As an additional note, if you don't own the underlying AI models and are just a better wrapper for Claude or ChatGPT you at best have a very weak IP or patent position. reply",

          "text": "If you're in the US, look into relevant court cases[0][1][2]. The courts tend to hold that algorithms are not patentable - what is patentable would be an invented machine which uses a software algorithm as one of its components. But even then, the machine needs to have some other inventive, patentable physical component. (This sort of thing tend to confuse people since, the US patent office doesn't check for patent validity before granting patents. So there are a lot of companies that own invalid patents which have simply never been challenged in court.) If you live elsewhere you should look into the laws of your local jurisdiction, but many places have the same or similar legal doctrine.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been steadfastly trying my best to incorporate the latest-and-greatest models into my workflow. I've been primarily using Codex recently. But I'm still having difficulties.<p>For example: no matter what I do, I can't prevent Codex from introducing linter errors.<p>I use tabs instead of spaces for indentation. It seems like the model is massively weighted on code written using spaces (duh). Despite having a very well articulated styleguide (that Codex helped me write after examining my codebase!) that clearly specifies that tabs are used for indentation, the model will happily go off and make a bunch of changes that incorporate spaces seemingly at random. It will use tabs correctly in certain places, but then devolve back to using spaces later on in the same files.<p>I have a linter that I've taught the model to run to catch these things, but A) that feels like such a waste of tokens and B) the model often forgets to run the linter anyway.<p>It's like having a junior developer who has never used the tab key before. They remember to ctrl-f their spaces-&gt;tabs sometimes before opening a PR, but not all the time. So I wind up giving them the same feedback over and over.<p>This example -- tabs instead of spaces -- is just one specific case where the model seems to invariably converge on a local maximum that is dictated by the center of the software bell curve. But in general I'm finding it to be true of just about any \"quirky\" style opinion I want to enforce:<p>- Avoid Typescript's `any` or `unknown`: the model will still happily throw these in to make the compiler happy<p>- Avoid complex ternaries: nope, the model loves these<p>- Avoid inscrutable one-letter variables versus longer, self-descriptive ones: nope, `a` it is<p>It just seems like I'm using a tool that is really good at producing the average software output by the average software developer. It's not able to keep my aesthetic / architectural desires at the front of its thinking as it's making my desired changes. It's as if I hired the guy from Memento as an intern.<p>How do people get around this, other than slathering on even more admonitions to use tabs no matter what (thereby wasting valuable tokens)?<p>Beyond syntax, I'm still able to use the models to crudely implement new features or functionality, but the way they write code feels... inelegant. There's often a single unifying insight within grasp that the model could reach for to greatly simplify the code it wrote for a given task, but it's not able to see it without me telling it that it's there.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I use the defaults from rustfmt in rust, eslint or biome in TypeScript/JavaScript, or ruff in Python. I also have some .editorconfig files so my editor is automatically configured correctly. Importantly, I do tell the agents to always run the linters and use the auto-formatters if needed. They get it. Don't make them format code, it's slow. The auto formatters are better and they should use them. I also don't like any or unknown and I have some eslint rules against those, and the agents will notice and fix their code, automatically without being asked. I guess you can also find some linting rules against ternaries, or too short variables. I like eslint-plugin-unicorn for example and I think it has rules for that by default.

          "text": "A pre-commit hook that runs a linter and type-checking is absolutely vital to maintain the code formatting of AI generated commits. One observation I’ve made working with LLMs is that sometimes it’s worth being flexible and conforming to the LLM’s code style and patterns. Frankly the code doesn’t need to be elegant or follow arbitrary guidelines (in reality nobody cares if it uses spaces or tabs, what matters is the result). In the past (pre-LLM) I used to nitpick people in code reviews, calling out a bunch of stylistic preferences that I believed would keep the codebase “consistent” and “elegant”. The idea was that if the codebase is uniform it’s easier for other engineers to iterate on it or debug. Today I don’t care in the slightest. I’m not the one writing the code nor am I the one actively debugging it, that has been delegated to the AI. Furthermore very seldom am I actually reading any of the generated code unless it’s mission critical. I treat the code it generates as a black box until I can’t, and nowhere throughout that process do I worry about aesthetics. Try to put aside all code vanity, accept that not all code will be aesthetically pleasing or elegantly written. Focus on delivering the end goal, not the syntactical minutia. reply",

Is there any concrete evidence of this happening, or technical analysis that supports or disproves it? Or are we mostly seeing subjective evaluation without controlled benchmarks?</div>",

          "text": "I've been mostly using GPT-5 (the first) recently because it's better than 5.1 and 5.2. There's a clear difference. They're removing it next week; I'm canceling my subscription to ChatGPT. This happens all across the board. Sometimes to Anthropic. Almost every time with Gemini. They optimize for some solutions and cause problems to others. Some people want a syncopathic AI like GPT-4o. Personally, I loved the early patched GPT-5's ability to jailbreak itself. It was clearly a bug; great at finding solutions and skirting the absolute edges of the guardrails. They got rid of it because someone used this to override safety guardrails and commit suicide. ChatGPT has nearly a billion active users. As long as they keep trying to please all of them, win the next 1 billion, and avoid being banned by governments, they're going to keep doing this. The fix is to have your own model that works for a particular problem and self-host it or something. I still have a pet Mistral NeMo. reply",

Spend time crafting good prompts (use chatgpt for generating prompts and feed it to your AI coder ;) ) for ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor, ask it to generate docs and explain what it just did.

It is a new lesser interface, not a replacement. Like a GUI, more accessible but functionally restricted. An interface that is conditioned on previously solved tasks, but unable to solve novel ones. What this means is coding becomes accessible to those looking to apply something like python to solved problems, but it very much remains inaccessible to those looking to solve truly novel problems they have the skill to solve in their domain, but lack the coding skills to describe. As a simple example, claude code is easily among the most competent coding interfaces I know of right now. However, if I give it a toy problem I've been toying with as a hobby project, and it breaks so badly it starts hallucinating that it is chatgpt. ```\n  This is actually a very robust design pattern that prevents overconfidence and enables continuous improvement.

Let me\n  provide a more focused analysis: ``` /insights doesn't help of course, it simply recommends I clear context on those situations and try again, but naturally it has the same problems. This isn't isolated, unless I give it simple tasks, it fails. The easy tasks it excels at though, it has handled a broad variety of tasks to a high degree of satisfaction, but it is a long shot away from replacing just writing code.

Any feedback is welcome (textbook to be published gplv3 via GitHub). I appreciate I am on the conservative side here. The following is copy-paste of the final notes/tips/warnings in the book, copied from latex source with minimal edits for display here: Rather than viewing AI as forbidden or universally permitted, consider this progression: 1. Foundation Phase (Avoid generation, embrace explanation) When learning a new library (e.g., your first RDKit script or lmfit model), do not ask the AI to write the code. Instead, write your own attempt, then use AI to: • Explain error tracebacks in plain language • Compare your approach to idiomatic patterns • Suggest documentation sections you may have missed 2. Apprenticeship Phase (Pair programming) Once you can write working but inelegant code, use AI as a collaborative reviewer: • Refactor working scripts for readability • Vectorize slow loops you have already prototyped • Generate unit tests for functions you have written 3. Independence Phase (Managed delegation) When you have the skill to write the code yourself but choose to delegate to save time, you are essentially trading the effort of writing for the effort of auditing. Because your prompts are condensed summaries of intent rather than literal instructions, the LLM must fill the \"ambiguity gap\" with educated guesses. Delegation only works if you are skilled enough to recognise when those guesses miss the mark; if your words were precise enough to never be misunderstood, they would already be code. Coding without oversight is dangerous and deeply incompetent behaviour in professional environments. Examples of use-cases are: • Generate boilerplate for familiar patterns, then audit line-by-line • Prototype alternative algorithms you already understand conceptually • Document code you have written (reverse the typical workflow) reply",

          "text": "First of all, that’s great. That’s what I hope it would happen: non technical people using this tools, feeling the apart of “power” of coding, and feeling the desire to learn more. About your question, it is hard to give one. I don’t think there is one big thing that makes everything click, and if there is one, it is probably different for different people. But I can give some advices. 1. You can ask the AI itself to explain how the code works. In my experience they are usually fine at that. You can probably tailor the explanation to your technical level, so that’s neat. 2. Stick to one language. I don’t know which language your AI is using for your tools (probably Python if they run on your machine or JavaScript if they work on a browser). Learning what you are using is the first step. 3. Once you know that, you can use the AI and some online guides to learn the very basics of the language. Maybe ask the AI for very simple toy tools (e.g., a web page where you write a phrase, click a button, and it will show that phrase with the words in reverse order) and try to understand what the code does. You may still ask the AI about the lines you don’t understand. 4. It is a potentially long journey. Go as far as you like. After these first steps, you will likely have more specific questions. That’s good. :) reply",

          "text": "I'm a solo dev building a handful of apps across different niches.. - Kvile ( https://kvile.app ) — A lightweight desktop HTTP client built with Rust + Tauri. Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

Also as a Linux user, I deeply appreciate the linux support :-) A few questions and comments: | Kvile | - Awesome, really happy to see a reasonable take on this (open source, offline-first, no telemetry, no acount, etc).  Do you think at some point you'll try to monetize it in some way? - Looks like build assets didn't get attached for the latest release (v0.2.1) in Github: https://github.com/tskulbru/kvile/releases/tag/kvile-v0.2.1 | Mockingjay | - Awesome, definitely a valuable project.  I'll be sharing this with some friends who could really use this. | Stao | - The website says it's open source, but I couldn't find a link to the source repo.  I looked at your github repos and didn't see it in there either. - Great idea!  I'm so bad about forgetting to stand so something like this could be super useful. reply",

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

It's a EU-based Kagi [2] alternative (privacy-focused and ad-free search with domain boosting/exclusion rules). We've been using it with friends and family semi-successfully (hashbangs work for edge cases we're still working on). It's really difficult to get bigger indexes other than Mojeek and Marginalia to want to work with us and improve the results further, so that's something I've been researching more, lately. EUSP (the new Ecosia/Qwant-effort-related index) has finally replied to me last week, but I'm still waiting on an API key. If you're interested in trying it for a few days and are a human, reach out with your account number and I'll give you a couple of weeks for free. We're pushing improvements daily.

Now he has to out-hack teachers, drones, and a traitor friend using only his brain, his DIY skills, and the outlaw Mesh. Readers get wild gadgets, sneaky pranks, and fast chases—plus the chance to ask what they would do if adults tried to control every thought in their head. Final edits from the editor are arriving this week - then I'm off to find a lit agent, hopefully get a publishing deal by the end of 2026.

          "text": "Very nice, ran well in a VM on my home NAS. I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

Vibe coding signifies a lack of control over one's own code and generally only if it's to generate ideas or throwaway. The negative connotation that goes with it is appropriate too. In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

I know tools like this exist but I couldn't find one with the filtering and UI I actually wanted, so I built it myself. Stack: FastAPI + Next.js + PostgreSQL, containerized on AWS ECS Fargate with an ALB. Frontend on Amplify. This is honestly my first real AWS deployment and I don't ever want to do this again. ECS alone took me a solid day to figure out. I also can't get amplify to use the domain I bought even though I set all of the DNS records up :/ Email notifications are still being worked on so right now it's just a view of all the job postings. Job match notifications and saving jobs should be up soon. I would love feedback on the job matching and UI in the meantime (especially if you find a bug).\nHappy to answer questions or hear how you'd approach the AWS side differently! reply",

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

          "text": "So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales). Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors. I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too. Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions! reply",

You can graphically explore arguments, track their logical sufficiency/necessity, and make counterpoints.

          "text": "I’ve had a concept like this in the back of my mind for years. Happy to see someone executing it so well. For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?) That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments. reply",

And suddenly we have something like Moltbook to pollute our planet even more. Where are we going with this?<p>Anybody feels something like that?

We require determinism, whereas AI fundamentally operates on probability. The issue is the Pareto Principle in overdrive: AI gets you to 90% instantly, but in our environment, anything less than 100% is often a failure. Bridging that final 10% reliability gap is the real challenge. Still, I view total replacement as inevitable. We are currently in a transition period where our job is to rigorously experiment and figure out how to safely cross that gap. Good luck! reply",

I like the idea of spending a bit of time to learn something, like how to use a shell, how to ride a bike, how to drive a car, how to program in C or C++, and use the skill for years or decades, if not a lifetime.

But it sounds like your problem isn't knowing what to believe.  Your problem is that you know the truth, and you're tired of having to wallow in the lies all day.  I don't blame you; lies are bad for your mental health.  Well, there's a solution:  Turn off the internet.  You can, you know.  Or at least you can turn off the feed into your brain.  Stop looking at posts about AI, even on HN.  If you can't dodge them well enough, just turn off social media.  Go outside, if  the temperature is decent.  If it isn't, go to a gym or an art museum or something.  Just stop feeding this set of lies into your brain. reply",

Recommended reading: [0] What you are seeing is that anyone can build anything with just a computer and a AI agent and the AI boosters are selling dreams, courses and fantasies without the risks or downsides that come with it. Most of these vibe coded projects just have very bad architecture and the experienced humans still have to review and clean it all up. Meanwhile, \"AGI\" is being promised by those big labs, but their actions says otherwise as what it really means is an IPO. After that, we will see a crash come afterwards and the hype brigade and all the vibe coders will be raced to zero by local models and will move on after the grift has concluded. You now need to know what to build and what should exist out of infinite possibilities as you can assume that someone can do that in 10 mins with AI. What used to be 90% of startups fail; with AI it is now 98% of them failing. We know how this all ends. Do not fall for the hype.

      "title": "Ask HN: We're building a saving app for European savers and need GTM advice",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN, I'm Alessandro, founder of unflat.finance. We're an Italian startup building a stablecoin yield app for everyday Europeans people who have never touched a wallet, don't know what Morpho is, and have no interest in learning.<p>What we do today: Users deposit euros via cooinbase pay. We convert to USDC, split their deposit across multiple isolated Morpho vaults on Base chain (each with different collateral types and borrowers pledging 150-200% of what they receive), and they earn 4-7% APY. They see one number: their balance growing daily. No wallet, no gas fees, no tokens. We have apps built for both iOS and Android, currently in beta.<p>The market context: This category is exploding in the US. Axal (a16z CSX, $2.5M), Nook (Coinbase Ventures, $2.5M, ~7.6% avg APY, built by ex-Coinbase/Uber team), YieldClub ($2.5M), and Aave itself launched a consumer savings app with up to 9% APY and $1M deposit protection. They're all live or in waitlist. They all run on the same proven infrastructure (Morpho has had $8.5B in peak deposits, 25+ audits, backed by $69M from a16z and Coinbase Ventures, used by Société Générale).<p>But they're all US-first. ACH, Plaid, Apple Pay, USD-denominated. Europe 350M+ banking customers sitting at near-zero rates — has no equivalent. In the US you can get 4-5% at Marcus or Wealthfront. In Europe, most banks pay 0.5% or less. The yield gap here is wider, and nobody is serving it.<p>That's our bet. We're also working on EURc (Circle's euro stablecoin) integration so the entire flow stays euro-denominated — no FX exposure. That's something no US competitor can replicate.<p>What we want to build next: An AI agent that automates portfolio allocation based on each user's risk profile. You answer a few questions about risk tolerance, time horizon, goals the agent handles vault selection, rebalancing, entry/exit across DeFi strategies. Think Wealthfront/Betterment for crypto, not another trading bot. The multi-vault architecture on Morpho makes this natural: different risk profiles map to different vault compositions.<p>Where I need help:<p>Go-to-market for non-crypto users in Europe: Our target is the person with €10-50K in a savings account earning nothing, not crypto Twitter degens. Every crypto marketing channel attracts the wrong audience. We're running a waitlist with tiered bonuses (+2% APY for first 500 users, referral bonuses), but how do you actually reach normal savers? Has anyone cracked fintech distribution in Europe without burning cash on Meta/Google ads (which are restricted for crypto anyway)?<p>Driving traffic to the site: SEO/GEO is slow, content marketing takes months to compound, paid ads for crypto are a minefield. What's actually moved the needle for early-stage fintech in Europe? We're bootstrapped, so capital-efficient channels matter.<p>Trust for non-crypto users: We lead with radical transparency — every user gets a public on-chain link showing every deposit, earning, and withdrawal. We put risk disclaimers front and center (\"this is not a bank account, never deposit what you can't afford to lose\"). But is that enough? What trust signals actually convert skeptical Europeans?<p>The stablecoin savings app category is being defined right now. YC literally listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest Requests for Startups. We think Europe is the bigger opportunity — the yield gap is wider and nobody's building here yet. Would love to hear from anyone who's built in this space.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Potentially \"vibe-coding\" as in the sense: you don't know how to develop this yourself (perhaps you are not a software developer?) While this may be possible, it likely requires a very detailed prompt and/or spec document. --- Here is an example of something I successfully built with Claude: https://rift-transcription.vercel.app Apparently I have had over 150 chat sessions related to the research and development of this tool. - First, we wrote a spec together: https://github.com/Leftium/rift-transcription/blob/main/spec... - The spec broke down development into major phases. I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting. And after implementation, I often had to have Claude fix bugs in the implementation. - I tried to share the chat session where Claude got the first functional MVP working: https://opncd.ai/share/fXsPn1t1 (unfortunately the shared session is truncated) --- \"AI mistakes you're probably making\": https://youtu.be/Jcuig8vhmx4 I think the most relevant point is: AI is best for accelerating development tasks you could do on your own; not new tasks you don't know how to do. --- Finally: Cloudlflare builds OAuth with Claude and publishes all the prompts: https://hw.leftium.com/#/item/44159166 reply",

No CS degree, no background in the domains I'm working in, no institutional affiliation.<p>The work is rigorous. Someone with serious credentials has engaged and asked substantive questions. The systems function as designed. But I can't point to the traditional markers that would establish legitimacy—degrees, publications, years of experience in the field.<p>This isn't about whether AI \"did the work.\" I made every decision, evaluated every output, iterated through hundreds of refinements. The AI was a tool that compressed what would have taken years of formal education into months of intensive, directed learning and execution.<p>Here's what interests me: We're entering a period where traditional signals of competence—credentials, institutional validation, experience markers—no longer reliably predict capability.\nSomeone can now build sophisticated systems, conduct rigorous analysis, and produce novel insights without any of the credentials that historically signaled those abilities. The gap between \"can do\" and \"should be trusted to do\" is widening rapidly.<p>The old gatekeeping mechanisms are breaking down faster than new ones are forming. When credentials stop being reliable indicators of competence, what replaces them? How do we collectively establish legitimacy for knowledge and capability?<p>This isn't just theoretical—it's happening right now, at scale. Every day, more people are building things and doing work they have no formal qualification to do. And some of that work is genuinely good.<p>What frameworks should we use to evaluate competence when the traditional signals are becoming obsolete? How do we establish new language around expertise when terms like \"expert,\" \"rigorous,\" and \"qualified\" have been so diluted they've lost discriminatory power?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I work in a field that has a strong glass ceiling, and the only way through is with a PhD (some employers are starting to recognize that, with several years of experience, people with a bachelor's or master's degree can attain the same level of independence and mastery that you'd demand from a PhD, but it's still kinda rare). But even having a PhD isn't enough to establish credibility during the interview process, as there are plenty of PhDs who are incompetent. It's really more of a thing that gets your foot in the door - a signal that it's plausible that this candidate could have the juice. The solution is that after the usual interview steps (resume, phone screen, etc), the candidate gives an hour long seminar on their research to 10-20 people (really 45 minutes of material + 15 minutes of questions). It's basically impossible to talk for that long about your research and the prior literature with a critical audience of experts and not reveal whether you actually know your stuff. So in a sense, your vision has actually been achieved, but only within the group of people who have traditional credentials. The question of how to open this up to anyone regardless of credentials is not something I'm going to be able to answer, but I certainly hope it does. In terms of frameworks for evaluating competence, here's the questions I ask when deciding if someone is an expert (and what I get out of these questions in parentheses): 1) Has this person spent years doing something where they constantly discovered that they were wrong? (if you're never wrong, you're not learning and you're certainly not doing anything interesting, and might be a crank) 2) Did they have a mentor or group of expert peers who helped them grow and critiqued their work? (this both helps them grow on a daily basis and also plugs gaps in their knowledge and skills, and gives them new ways of thinking) 3) Have they built or discovered something non-trivial, and in the LLM era, do they actually understand what they built? (You can't really be sure your knowledge and skills are meaningful until you apply them) 4) Can they hold their own when being grilled by other people with deep experience in the same field, or adjacent fields? (This assumes the experts are arguing in good faith, but if you can either answer critical questions or convince someone that their questions are flawed, that's a great sign) 5) Do they have both depth and breadth in their knowledge of their field? (I think this one might get downplayed as it smacks of gatekeeping, but it's so easy to make huge errors or reinvent the wheel when you don't know what other people have already done, and don't know how your contribution fits into the work of others) 6) Can they explain their work on multiple levels of complexity? (Filters out people who are just trying to hide their incompetence with jargon) 7) Are they willing to say they don't know, when asked a question they don't know the answer to? (Cranks will never admit this) reply",

The one difference between \"can do\" and \"should be trusted to do\" is the ability to systematically prove that \"can do\" holds up close to 100% of task instances and under adverserial conditions. Hacking and pentesting are already scaling fully autonomously - and systematically. For now, lower level targets aren't yet attractive as such scale requires sophisticated (state) actors, but that is going to change. So building systems that white-hat prove your code is not only functional but competent are going to be critical not to be ripped apart by black-hat later on.

          "text": "This is a good point. You're right that adversarial testing provides one form of validation that doesn't depend on credentials if the system holds up under systematic attack, that's evidence of competence regardless of who built it. But I think there's a distinction worth making between technical robustness (does the code have vulnerabilities?) and epistemic legitimacy (should we trust the analysis/conclusions?). Pentesting and formal verification can tell us whether a system is secure or functions correctly. That's increasingly automatable and credential-independent because the code either survives adversarial conditions or it doesn't. But what about domains where validation is murkier? Cross-domain analysis, research synthesis, strategic thinking, design decisions? These require judgment calls where \"correct\" isn't binary. The work can be rigorous and well-reasoned without being formally provable. The roborev example is interesting because code review is somewhat amenable to systematic validation. But we're also seeing AI collaboration extend into domains where adversarial testing isn't cleanly applicable—policy analysis, theoretical frameworks, creative work with analytical components. I wonder if we need different validation frameworks for different types of work. Technical systems: adversarial testing and formal verification. Analytical/intellectual work: something else entirely. But what? The deeper question: when the barrier to producing superficially plausible work drops to near-zero, how do we distinguish genuinely rigorous thinking from sophisticated-sounding nonsense? Credentials were a (flawed) heuristic for that. What replaces them in domains where adversarial testing doesn't apply? reply",

Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible.

Milk came in glass bottles, and the person who delivered the bottles of milk to our house picked up the empties to take back to the dairy.  There were also steel cans for canned food and soft drinks (which eventually rusts away), and of course lots of other glass bottles.  Now more and more of those kinds of things come in plastic, of which little gets recycled.  And cans are often aluminum, which doesn't rust away. Furniture was wood and fabric and (maybe) springs, with a little bit of pressboard (which was itself recycled paper and textile, usually used on the back of desks etc.).  Now furniture is particleboard (made from sawdust), with lots of glue and some kind of plastic veneer if it's in a place that shows.  Wood is genuinely recyclable (or re-usable as antiques!); I don't think particleboard is recyclable, although I could be wrong. Automobiles were steel, fabric, glass and copper wire (with rubber insulation); plus of course rubber tires.  Now they are those things plus a lot more plastic.  Tires, both then and now, are essentially un-recyclable (although occasionally turned into artificial reefs). I could go on, but there are probably more authoritative (= better) studies of this.  But I suspect in general that we have lots less recyclable \"stuff\" these days than we used to. reply",

          "text": "The ultimate reason is there isn't economic reason so.  It cost's a lot to recycle anything, and most electronics would net you almost nothing valuable. Let's look at an example.  Let's say your phones main board, which will net a few hundred grams of raw materials.  First thing by weight the actual board itself is probably the biggest,  if you could perfectly decompose it to it's parts you would have some fiberglass, glue, a few grams of copper, and maybe a trace amount of gold. Next you would have the different components, mostly ICs but let's cover them next.  These are mostly plastic with bits of copper, tin, and other more exotic metals. Most of these could be used again, if you can separate them and sort them.  There would be a bunch of solder, which maybe could be reused, if you remix it with more flux.  Finally, you'll have chips, these could be reused, but only as replacements for the same chip.  Getting anything out of these would mostly be removing the bulk of the material which is silicon that's been contaminated with other elements to make the semiconductors.  I don't think there is any process right now that could take doped Si and get you anything back.  Besides the silicon you have micrograms of gold and other conductors. Having put all that down, I think there could be an opportunity to take the bulk components off boards, test and sort them, and sell them in bulk. reply",

Many times the only viable option to fix something is to swap a board, or replace the entire item, instead of replacing the one failed component that caused the board to fail, or reflowing the board etc.. Many components also do not offer batteries that can be replaced, such as the magic mouse, so you end up needing to replace the entire item. It's interesting how as certain things age, such as cars, cottage industries pop up to do just that when new replacement boards and parts are not available. The other issue is cost cutting. Many components are made cheaply and fail pre-maturely. Great examples of this are mains voltage LED bulbs where the rectifier circuits that power the LED's fail, but the only real option is to replace the entire thing, creating a lot of e-waste in the process. reply",

I think we're better off lobbying for better standards to communicate the quality of a bulb's design.

Did it stop being so because washers and TVs and vacuums became too complicated to understand, or the parts went up in cost, or because $1000 is considered cheap enough of a device to be considered disposable? No. They stopped existing because appliances stopped coming with the reference materials to repair them in a reasonable time and parts are obfuscated from their source so people don't even know what their broken part is half the time. Is that a thermistor, a capacitor, a diode that blew up? Have fun spending the next 2 hours tracing the obfuscated part number down through 5 different suppliers to figure it out because you obviously can't test a broken part and there is no schematic to look at and identify it from. reply",

          "text": "Major appliance repair is very much still a thing, and manufacturers share repair info under their partner programs. But this makes sense because shipping them back for warranty is prohibitively expensive and people are willing to pay a few hundred bucks to fix a couple thousand dollar appliance.  They’re still not doing component level repair, because module replacement is still cheaper and more reliable. Small appliances and electronics are not repaired as any more much because: 1. their real price has cratered over the past 50 years 2. they have more integrated and specialized parts that simply aren’t repairable or available 3. They have fewer mechanical parts prone to regular failure or which pay the bills for repair shops (belts, timers, etc) 4. They are far more complicated than their predecessors, and therefore more complicated to diagnose even if you have a schematic But yeah, when everyone’s washing machine has a belt transmission and a clunky mechanical timer, they failed all the time and there were repair shops on every corner. But these places weren’t doing the type of work akin to SMD rework on a digital circuits. reply",

          "text": "There was a cartel, but this is one of those \"more complicated than it appears\" situations. In incandescent bulbs, there is a real tradeoff between durability of the bulb, efficiency (lumens/watt), and brightness/quality of the light, for physics reasons you _can't_ improve one without degrading the other. Since \"quality of light\" is a very difficult thing to market, there was an incentive to push \"lifetime of the bulb\" in marketing and just make the light quality increasingly worse. The cartel attempted to halt that by making everyone agree on a lifetime/quality to hit and not participate in a race to the bottom (and yes, there was also the obvious benefit to the cartel members of increased sales and profits, which they explicitly talked about in internal documents). I want to be very clear that I'm anti cartels and I'm not trying to say \"so this was all hunky dory\", just that this was not (and these things very rarely are) a simple case of \"they made the product objectively worse for the sole sake of more money\". Instead, they chose a different point on the pareto-frontier of brightness/efficiency/lifespan that also had the benefit of making them more money. But yes, LED bulbs are currently mostly garbage and have terrible heat/power management electronics which means that in practice you almost never get anywhere close to the theoretical life span increases (because the electronics die from overheating far before the actual LEDs themselves would go out), and finding out information on how well a given bulb brand does on heat/power management is essentially impossible. reply",

I think what recyclers do currently is at least break everything into small pieces, some of which might have a decent concentration of something useful reply",

Writing the thoughts down, like logs, makes them feel less real and less recursive. Once it's on paper, it loses some power. One small thought exercise I picked up from The Power of Now that surprisingly works for me: when I'm deep in a rabbit hole, I take a few deep breaths and ask myself, \"What will my next thought be?\" For a moment everything just goes quiet, and the mind kind of resets. I've used this hack multiple times. Another thing that matters more than I expected is just building basic habits. Exercise, walking, sleeping on time, eating properly. Nothing fancy, but having a pattern makes the bad loops less frequent. I've also learned anxiety isn't always something you can reason away. Sometimes it's just a physical state and you have to change the input before the mind follows. reply",

          "text": "I went at it slowly and always empirically and had the luxury of it being \"low stakes\" About two years ago I felt I got an invitiation to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsunetsuki and then a year ago I found a book that talked about fox mediums in China that made it seem like everything I wished it could be and started keeping an altar.  I had some idea of the outlines of the practice but other than making regular offerings didn't really do much,  in fact at one point my son was surprised when I told him I was still into that. Around the end of November I was watching an anime where there was a character who had an animal ear hood (as opposed to a headband) and realized I could get away with wearing that and got the hood and when I started \"going out\" and the physical adjustments fell into place pretty quickly. I got into taking photographs as-a-fox because I just take photographs when I go out so of course I would.  By this point I had the brand promise, design rules and such figured out and one of them was \"no explaining,  no being reductionist,  no matter what you are not going to come across like Larry Summers\".  Early in January I got into the first situation where I felt I had to explain it and realized I'd screwed it up and how.  That weekend I was a little panicked but I came up with the \"cover story\" that \"this is a character I do to put people at ease when I do street photography\" which put my wife at ease because she was worried about how she was going to explain it to people. Between having the tokens and that story I'm never worried now that I'm going to get tongue tied.  I mean,  I really wish I had the \"voice of the fox\" both in terms of the vocal adjustments and the writing down better than I do.  But I have enough of the character working and the proof that people believe in it so sometimes I feel like the 1960s Peter Parker who finds that the community believes in Spider-Man even when he doesn't which makes me feel like I can face what is in front of me today,  that if I don't feel brave enough to try something it's OK,  never push on a string,  and always been thinking how to structure things so I don't have to be brave. Once I settled into the \"foxographer\" role and felt I had purpose I quit worrying entirely about going off brand.  Like I used to never program a computer or talk about my personal history while wearing the hood and now I do what I want. Sometimes I think \"Why couldn't I have figured this out 20 years ago?\" but I'm glad I did now. reply",

The assumption was that using common 3D printer measurement tools (like for bed-leveling) would provide a way to read back whatever data was encoded onto the surface.<p>Since that seems like a pretty well-known concept, crudely applied to a domain I haven't seen it in before - but is already large and growing fast - I'm assuming that others have thought of this? I was hoping maybe someone had implemented something like it?\nAnd then, obviously, if that proof of concept exists, I'd wonder about some kind of advanced version that used specialized equipment for the reading (and possibly the writing/printing).<p>In any case, I'm just curious. I was thinking about long term (century +) archival storage, or encryption keys only stored as the print with no digital copies. Stuff that wouldn't need tons of storage, but would be crucial to maintain statically. It probably wouldn't be useful for that, which is why I assume I'm not finding much in my searches for it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew about it, in case there is stuff it's good for.</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'm a solo dev building a handful of apps across different niches.. - Kvile ( https://kvile.app ) — A lightweight desktop HTTP client built with Rust + Tauri. Native .http file support (JetBrains/VS Code/Kulala compatible), Monaco editor, JS pre/post scripts, SQLite-backed history. Sub-second startup. MIT licensed, no cloud, your requests stay on your machine. Think Postman without the bloat and login walls. - Mockingjay ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockingjay-secure-recorder/id6... ) — iOS app that records video and streams AES-256-GCM encrypted chunks to your Google Drive in real-time. By the time someone takes your phone, the footage is already safe in the cloud. Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs tamper-proof evidence. Features a duress PIN that wipes local keys while preserving cloud backups, and a fake sleep mode that makes the phone look powered off during recording. - Stao ( https://stao.app ) — A simple sit/stand reminder for standing desk users. Runs in the system tray, tracks your streaks, zero setup. Available on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. - MyVisualRoutine ( https://myvisualroutine.com ) — This one is personal. I have three kids, two with severe disabilities. Visual schedules (laminated cards, velcro boards) are a lifeline for non-verbal children, but they're a nightmare to manage and they don't leave the house. So I built an app that lets you create a full visual routine in about 20 seconds and take it anywhere. Choice boards, First/Then boards, day  plans, 50+ preloaded activities, works fully offline. Free tier is genuinely usable. Available on iOS and Android. reply",

Also as a Linux user, I deeply appreciate the linux support :-) A few questions and comments: | Kvile | - Awesome, really happy to see a reasonable take on this (open source, offline-first, no telemetry, no acount, etc).  Do you think at some point you'll try to monetize it in some way? - Looks like build assets didn't get attached for the latest release (v0.2.1) in Github: https://github.com/tskulbru/kvile/releases/tag/kvile-v0.2.1 | Mockingjay | - Awesome, definitely a valuable project.  I'll be sharing this with some friends who could really use this. | Stao | - The website says it's open source, but I couldn't find a link to the source repo.  I looked at your github repos and didn't see it in there either. - Great idea!  I'm so bad about forgetting to stand so something like this could be super useful. reply",

I made something that looks pretty similar from the looks of it just a few weeks ago because I found the same thing. If I knew your app existed I probably wouldn't have made it. I wasn't even thinking of selling it, just made it for my kid because it makes following various daily routines easier. It's a mostly vibe coded (well, I made tons of visual and technical decisions but didn't look at the code much except some spot checks) PWA that can run offline on an iPod Touch. It has some quirks and hidden features for day schedules, timers, etc. There's plenty of yank in there (yours is almost certainly built better) but it works pretty well for most daily routines.

          "text": "Yeah, totally agree. Maybe it can inspire your app too, wish you the very best and a lot of sales. Some of the hidden features: - If you add a task to a routine and end it with a question mark it becomes a conditional where you can add specific tasks or subroutines on the yes or no condition. - Make it 'weekday?' and it becomes a switch case for the week. - 'is it 7:30 yet?' becomes a conditional that automatically detects if it's before that time. I use it for e.g. 'before breakfast' (at 7:30) -> go play (with a timer until 7:30) N.b. 'fun' fact, my daughter wanted an avatar with clothes that you can earn. The idea was pretty easy to implement but getting nano banana (using a great Claude nano banana skill) to generate the correct images took... some practice. I think I spent more time on the images for the avatars than all the other features combined. It took way too long to realize simple stuff like \"nano banana won't generate transparency, only a fake white/grey checker pattern\" Also learned the last iPod touch (great device by the way) has a really low screen resolution which can be quite challenging at times. reply",

          "text": "https://sampler.meiji.industries/ I built a TUI sampler which cherry-picks my favourite features from modern & vintage hardware samplers, DAWs, plugins, outboard FX gear, and DJ equipment. If you know what an AKAI MPC Live, MPC 3000, SP404, SP1200, BOSS RC-202, Alesis 3630, Serato Sample, S950 filters, and stem separation does, then you'll love seeing these \"greatest hits\" up in a terminal interface. Last year while on vacation in Costa Rica, I started scratching my own itch for locating and organizing samples, which quickly evolved into adding more and more features while keeping it tactile and immediate.  It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better. It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking. Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events. Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :) reply",

It's a EU-based Kagi [2] alternative (privacy-focused and ad-free search with domain boosting/exclusion rules). We've been using it with friends and family semi-successfully (hashbangs work for edge cases we're still working on). It's really difficult to get bigger indexes other than Mojeek and Marginalia to want to work with us and improve the results further, so that's something I've been researching more, lately. EUSP (the new Ecosia/Qwant-effort-related index) has finally replied to me last week, but I'm still waiting on an API key. If you're interested in trying it for a few days and are a human, reach out with your account number and I'll give you a couple of weeks for free. We're pushing improvements daily.

I've always noodled about this marketplace idea where an optimization algorithm could match your interests and a dollar amount you can afford to let you rent/buy artist's music. The optimization would maximize the purchase of the differently valued music(analogus to the weighted  knapsack problem but this could have multiple solutions, knapsack is a nice way of thinking about it logically, in reality implementation may be completely different) based only on your interests, like history and dollars u have. I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes. I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like. reply",

In reality any project that takes 6 months means your have invested a lot of time thinking about the code, in which case LLMs become more useful for the things you care about e.g. maintainability, forcing LLMs to bend to your will, which is like saying: \" I know this design is the best so just make this instead of whatever abstraction you think is better\". reply",

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/ . A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge . The circuitscript code file is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs! I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part. The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design. I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user. For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript. reply",

          "text": "So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales). Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors. I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too. Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions! reply",

For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?) That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments. reply",

What if you could sell the data for each argument? That might be valuable to LLM labs, because then you can essentially guarantee that every single argument you provide is human checked, and you could accumulate a large DB of those. Of course you'll never be able to capture every single argument possible, but it's rather a mechanism that would allow incremental improvement with time. But codifying logic and natural language is a very nice idea. reply",

This is him trying to FOMO listeners into using his project. From what I've observed, the people trying to use herds of agents to work on different things at the same time are just using tokens as fast as possible because they think more tokens means more progress. As you scale up the sub-agents you spend so much time managing the herd and trying to backtrack when things go wrong that you would have been better off handling it serially with yourself in the loop. If you don't have someone else paying the bill for unlimited token usage it's going to be a very expensive experiment. reply",

I ended up building a \"traffic light\" protocol (essentially a semaphore for swarms) just to force serialization on critical tasks. It kills the speed slightly but stops the \"death spiral\" where one agent's error cascades through the herd.

Modern agentic coding spins up its own sub-agents when it makes sense to parallelize. It's just not as sexy as typing a sentence and letting your AI bill go BRR (and then talking about it).

Yegge's own project (Gas Town) is a real world attempt to build just the agent part, and still many more parts are needed. It's so complicated, I don't think any open source solution is going to become dominant, because there's  too much to integrate. The company that perfects this is going to be the next GitHub and Heroku rolled into one. I get why people question all this. It's a completely different way of working that flies in the face of every best practice and common-sense lesson you learn as a software developer. But once you wrap your head around it, it makes total sense. You don't need to read code to know a system works and is reliable. You don't need to manually inspect the quality of things if there's other ways to establish trust. Work gets done a lot faster with automation, ironically with fewer errors. You can use cutting-edge technology to improve safety and performance, and ship faster. These aren't crazy hypothetical ideals - what I just described is  modern auto manufacturing. If it's safe enough for a car, it's safe enough for a web app. reply",

When you run multiple agents, each one needs a coherent view of the codebase. The real bottleneck isn't the number of agents, it's how you slice ownership. The best pattern I've seen: give each agent clear module boundaries (not file-level, but architectural). Think micro-services even in a monolith. Then each agent owns its domain end-to-end. Also: dry-run everything. Let agents propose changes, then review before applying. It's like having a senior dev who says 'wait, let me think about this' before every commit.

We're solving years-old GPU bugs that we had given up on as mere mortals. And yes, we build our own orchestrator tech, both as our product (not vibes coding but vibes investigating), and more relevant here, our internal tooling. For example, otel & evals increasingly drive our AI coding loops rather than people. Codex and claude code are great agentic coding harnesses, so our 'custom orchestration' work is more about more intelligently using them in richer pipelines, like the above eval-driven loop. They've been pretty steadily adding features like parallel subagents that work in teams, and hookable enough to do most tricks, that I don't feel the need to use others.

Once you get how data moves, where state lives, and what happens when things break, a lot of the \"magic\" disappears. Learning basic debugging and reading stack traces also compounds forever, even with AI. One thing that helped me: think a bit like a PM. Spend time crafting good prompts (use chatgpt for generating prompts and feed it to your AI coder ;) ) for ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor, ask it to generate docs and explain what it just did. Over time, patterns emerge and things feel less mysterious. LLMs write code well, but they don't give you mental models. That part you still have to build. reply",

It launches a background subagent (forking context) that check (and updates) my ‘learning-profile.md’. I can pass additional requests, but otherwise it just deduces from context. It then creates an explainer/lesson. And sends it to my kindle (using a custom created mcp) - so I can read it offline. Not breaking my flow. I’ve never learned so much so quickly, about everything. It’s awesome. I use the same mcp from phone apps. Everytime I want to learn something I just ask. Also: learn about the GIT concepts (not commands).

Any feedback is welcome (textbook to be published gplv3 via GitHub). I appreciate I am on the conservative side here. The following is copy-paste of the final notes/tips/warnings in the book, copied from latex source with minimal edits for display here: Rather than viewing AI as forbidden or universally permitted, consider this progression: 1. Foundation Phase (Avoid generation, embrace explanation) When learning a new library (e.g., your first RDKit script or lmfit model), do not ask the AI to write the code. Instead, write your own attempt, then use AI to: • Explain error tracebacks in plain language • Compare your approach to idiomatic patterns • Suggest documentation sections you may have missed 2. Apprenticeship Phase (Pair programming) Once you can write working but inelegant code, use AI as a collaborative reviewer: • Refactor working scripts for readability • Vectorize slow loops you have already prototyped • Generate unit tests for functions you have written 3. Independence Phase (Managed delegation) When you have the skill to write the code yourself but choose to delegate to save time, you are essentially trading the effort of writing for the effort of auditing. Because your prompts are condensed summaries of intent rather than literal instructions, the LLM must fill the \"ambiguity gap\" with educated guesses. Delegation only works if you are skilled enough to recognise when those guesses miss the mark; if your words were precise enough to never be misunderstood, they would already be code. Coding without oversight is dangerous and deeply incompetent behaviour in professional environments. Examples of use-cases are: • Generate boilerplate for familiar patterns, then audit line-by-line • Prototype alternative algorithms you already understand conceptually • Document code you have written (reverse the typical workflow) reply",

          "text": "I'm a CS professor at an undergraduate college. I'm currently teaching a class on AI coding for non-programmers and also using Claude Code for all the projects in my upper level courses. I'm also planning to update our first course in the fall to include an intro to agentic programming. Here are some practical suggestions based on what I've seen with my students. To summarize: AI programming de-emphasizes the specifics of languages and frameworks but rewards having a good knowledge of systems and a careful, structured development process. 1. Do learn some by-hand programming in a standard language like Python. Even if you aren't looking at the AI-generated code, this will teach you the building blocks of software design - things like functions, classes, files, and data types - which will help you design more complex applications. The ability to look at a program and reason about what it's doing is a key skill. 2. The terminal environment if you aren't already using it. This will unlock additional levels of control and help you understand how agents use tools. 3. Architecture of the applications you're creating. If you're making web apps, for example, learn about the front-end and back-end, how they exchange information, how a back-end database works, etc. The key is not the low-level details of those things, but how an application is divided into parts that exchange data with each other. This knowledge helps you move from a general concept for an application to an actual design. 4. Related to that point: the concept of encapsulation in software design. This is the idea that each part of your system should be self-contained and exchange information with other parts through a well-defined interface. If a component is encapsulated, you can change its internal details without messing with the rest of the system. This is important for AI, because it allows you to carefully control the targets of your generations. 5. Specs-driven development. This is the evolution of vibe coding and is the main approach I teach now. Chat about the problem, then develop a detailed spec that describes the desired behavior. Refine that into a system design and detailed step-by-step task list with tests for each step. Working with the AI to compare design options is a great learning tool. 6. You don't need to learn much about algorithms unless you want to. Models are very strong at choosing and implementing all of the standard algorithms. Let these emerge naturally as you work on interesting problems. reply",

You simply leave the learned manifold and everything gets chaotic like in the example i provided. If AI can make what you want, then the thing you made is not as novel as you thought. You're repurpising solved problems. Still useful, still interesting, just not as ground breaking as the bot will try and tell you. reply",

          "text": "First of all, that’s great. That’s what I hope it would happen: non technical people using this tools, feeling the apart of “power” of coding, and feeling the desire to learn more. About your question, it is hard to give one. I don’t think there is one big thing that makes everything click, and if there is one, it is probably different for different people. But I can give some advices. 1. You can ask the AI itself to explain how the code works. In my experience they are usually fine at that. You can probably tailor the explanation to your technical level, so that’s neat. 2. Stick to one language. I don’t know which language your AI is using for your tools (probably Python if they run on your machine or JavaScript if they work on a browser). Learning what you are using is the first step. 3. Once you know that, you can use the AI and some online guides to learn the very basics of the language. Maybe ask the AI for very simple toy tools (e.g., a web page where you write a phrase, click a button, and it will show that phrase with the words in reverse order) and try to understand what the code does. You may still ask the AI about the lines you don’t understand. 4. It is a potentially long journey. Go as far as you like. After these first steps, you will likely have more specific questions. That’s good. :) reply",

          "text": "What do you mean with \"how all this works\"? Do you want to know how program code works, or how LLMs turn natural language into code? For the former, I think some hand coding will get the best results. A large part of \"thinking like a programmer\" is thinking about the sort of invisible structures that code will produce in a computer's memory when it runs - which is not the same as what's literally written in the code file. IMO, the best way to get a feel for that is to write code yourself, run it, examine the results, etc. But writing code can be a rather dry activity if you don't have motivation for what to write. The usual vibe coded projects are probably too complex to hand code without experience. I think two good starting points could be Code Katas [1] or the Pico8 game engine [2] (and of course any good \"intro to Python\" or \"intro to JavaScript\" tutorial on the web) -- For the latter, you could maybe start with the history of generative text models (like markov chains) and neural networks. Both technologies are several decades old and sort of form the very basic building blocks that made development of LLMs possible. In particular, neural networks made use of the gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms that are still the basis of most LLM training processes - even if they might now run for months and take exabytes of training data. Then there is of course the \"Attention is all you need\" paper that introduced the Transformer architecture - the kind of latest-generation neural network that underpins most LLMs - and basically started the whole LLM revolution. (It's also the \"T\" in GPT) (For historical interest, there is also the whole theory of formal languages/grammars and automata - which was the previous attempt to understand human language with computers. That theory gave us a lot of things - such as the Turing Machine and the entire theory of how to build and read a programming language. What it didn't give us though was a way to process human language...) -- As for the specific question of how an LLM can take this request in human language and generate that code from it that happens to fullfill all the requirements - that's an active area of research and I honestly doubt that right now anyone understands that in all entirety. Through I believe Anthropic and LessWrong had some interesting blog posts about this topics where they tried to understand the functions of certain specific neurons in an LLM.

But it turns out it never worked. Openclaw just didn;t respond at all.<p>I changed to calling the OpenAI API key. It worked.<p>So has anyone met with the same problem and solved it?

          "text": "So before the gate keeping starts, my first crack at optimizations was in 1987 on a 1 MHz Apple //e 1. I wrote the code in BASIC 2. I wrote the code in assembly 3. I got more improvement because storing and reading from the first page of memory took two clock cycles instead of 3. But this isn’t 1986, this is 2026. I “vibe coded” my first project this year.  I designed the AWS architecture from the an empty account using IAC, I chose every service to use, I verified every permission,  I chose and designed the orchestration, the concurrency model, I gathered requirements.  What I didn’t do is look at a line of Python code or infrastructure code aside from the permissions that Codex generated. Now to answer your questions : How did I validate the correctness? Just like if I had written it myself.  I had Codex to create a shell script to do end to end tests of all of the scenarios I cared about and when one broke, I went back to Codex to fix it. I was very detailed about the scenarios. The web front end that I used was built by another developer.  I haven’t touched web dev in a decade. I told Codex what changes I needed and I verified the changes by deploying it and testing it manually. How did I validate the performance? Again just like I would do on something I wrote.  I tested it first with a few hundred  transactions to verify the  functionality and then I stress tested it with a real world amount a transactions.  The first iteration broke horribly.  Not because of Claude code.  It was a bad design. But here’s the beauty.  It took me a day to do the bad implementation that would have taken me three or four days.  I then redesigned it, didn’t use the AWS service and did I designed that was much more scalable and it took a day.  I knew in theory how it worked under the hood.  But not in practice.  Again I tested for scalability by testing the result. The architectural quality? I validated it by synthesizing real world traffic.  ChatGPT in thinking mode did find a subtle concurrency bug.  That was my fault though.  I designed the concurrency implementation, Codex just did what I told it to do. Subtle bugs happen whether people write it or an agent writes it.  You do the best you can with your tests and when they come up you fix it? How do I prevent technical debt? All large implementations have technical debt. Again just like when I lead a team - I componenitize everything with clean interfaces.  It makes it easier for coding agents and people. reply",

But the gap between the marketing and reality for many of us is hard to describe. The people and corporations and all those LinkedIn gurus, podcasters declaring our obsolescence are overwhelmingly people who've never built or maintained anything complex in their lives. I'm sick of posts showing developers as awesome managers orchestrating fleets of Codex and Claude Code instances — I don't know a single person who actually has access to unlimited quotas for that. I'm now scared to publish open source because some random AI agent might spam my repo with garbage PRs and issues. \nAre we really expected to deliver mediocre C compilers while emitting millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere just to make a handful of rich people even more rich? And suddenly we have something like Moltbook to pollute our planet even more. Where are we going with this?<p>Anybody feels something like that? I seriously thinking about leaving the industry to keep my mental health in control or switch to some tech that is hard for AI.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I do not personally find LLMs useful for my job, but it does concern me that the hype might become so strong that I'm unable to find a job where I'm allowed to simply not use the tool if it isn't providing me value. And if it comes to that I'll use the stupid thing because I'd rather do that than go homeless, but I will certainly hate my job if it becomes just \"supervise the LLMs\". In order to combat that worry, I'm trying to focus on gratitude that I have had a career where I got paid for doing fun things (programming), rather than worrying about what if my career stops being fun. Many people never get that chance, after all, and live their entire lives working menial jobs just to put food on the table. I'm also trying to make my career less important to my own mental happiness by focusing on other things that are good and will not go away even if my career stops being fun (for me, that means my marriage and my faith). It's not easy to do, at all. And it also doesn't help the worry that I might even lose my job entirely because the industry abandons sense and fires people in favor of LLMs. But it does help a little, and I'm hoping that with practice the mental discipline will get easier and I can let go of the anxiety some. reply",

Even though I don't personally find AI terribly useful for my own actual work, I keep people happy by talking about it where possible. If someone has a suggestion involving something something fairly repetitive, I tell them \"that sounds like a great use case for an AI agent\", even if it is, in fact, a great use case for a shell script. If someone has an inane question, I tell them \"Have you tried asking copilot about this?\" - it's the new \"Let me google that for you...\". If someone has a request to add a new feature that seems useless and counterproductive, I tell them \"That's a great idea! How about you do that, using AI?\", instead of getting into a debate about why it won't work in practice.

          "text": "I actually opened HN to ask something similar. Thank you for putting this out there. Sadly, people who haven't delivered anything complex genuinely believe this is the end of the programmer role. I'm 43 and went through depression about my place in the industry. It was scary. Then I decided to build something complex using Claude, and within a week I realized that whoever claims \"90% of code is written by LLMs\" is not being totally honest, the parts left out from such posts tell a different story: programming is going to get harder, not easier. The project started great but turned into a large ball of spaghetti. It became really hard to extend, every feature you want to add requires Claude to rearrange large portions of the codebase. Debugging and reading logs are also very expensive tasks. If you don't have a mental model of the codebase, you have to rely on the LLM to read logs and figure things out for you. Overall, my impression is that we need to use this as just another tool and get proficient at it, instead of thinking it will do everything. Also, the recent Anthropic partnership with Accenture suggests otherwise [0]. If AI could do it all, why train humans? So please don't leave the industry. I think it will get worse before it gets better. We need to stick around longer and plan for all this hype period. [0] https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-accenture-partnersh... reply",

We require determinism, whereas AI fundamentally operates on probability. The issue is the Pareto Principle in overdrive: AI gets you to 90% instantly, but in our environment, anything less than 100% is often a failure. Bridging that final 10% reliability gap is the real challenge. Still, I view total replacement as inevitable.

I'm so lucky to get to do this for work and get paid pretty well to do it. It engages left and right brain. Yes, it's logic, math, all that; but writing code is creative, too. There are endless ways to solve a given problem, and you get to decide what approach is going to be cleanest, and readable, and maintainable, and just _feels_ right. Honestly though, doing code reviews isn't my favorite part of the job. It's fine, but the fun part for me is actually _doing_ it. Understanding the problem space in front of me and the constraints and all the other factors, and then generating _my own_ ideas and putting them into the editor, and iterating. So yeah, if the job becomes essentially reviewing AI code.. I don't know if I will still enjoy doing this. I mean, I'll do what I have to, I have a family, but it's not an exciting prospect. I'm not anti-AI at all and I use it to speed me up in plenty of ways. I'll have it give me snippets of code here and there for stuff I need, I'm using Claude Code here when the use case is right, that's all fine. I haven't had much luck with it implementing entire features or doing anything at ~medium complexity or higher. I don't _want_ it to do that anyway. I want to do that stuff. That's the fun part. I am concerned about its energy consumption too, and the hype is quite irritating as well. On both of those fronts, there's an opportunity for us to step back and consider what LLMs are actually good at, and use them where appropriate, instead of trying to infuse everything with AI. I'm probably just getting old and grumpy. But yeah, it's a little depressing. reply",

I agree it is depressing: there are quite a few people banging this drum and because of that it becomes harder to be heard. They, like AI have the advantage of quantity. There is one character right here on HN that spews out one low effort AI generated garbage article after another and it all gets upvoted as if it is profound and important. It isn't. All it shows is how incredibly bland all this stuff is. Meanwhile, here I am, solving a real problem. I use AI as well but mostly to serve as a teacher and I check each and every factoid that isn't immediately obviously true. And the degree to which that turns up hallucinations is proof enough to me that our jobs are safe, for now. A good niche is cleaning up after failed AI projects ;) best of luck there! Jacques reply",

Recommended reading: [0] What you are seeing is that anyone can build anything with just a computer and a AI agent and the AI boosters are selling dreams, courses and fantasies without the risks or downsides that come with it. Most of these vibe coded projects just have very bad architecture and the experienced humans still have to review and clean it all up. Meanwhile, \"AGI\" is being promised by those big labs, but their actions says otherwise as what it really means is an IPO. After that, we will see a crash come afterwards and the hype brigade and all the vibe coders will be raced to zero by local models and will move on after the grift has concluded. You now need to know what to build and what should exist out of infinite possibilities as you can assume that someone can do that in 10 mins with AI. What used to be 90% of startups fail; with AI it is now 98% of them failing. We know how this all ends. Do not fall for the hype.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN, I'm Alessandro, founder of unflat.finance. We're an Italian startup building a stablecoin yield app for everyday Europeans people who have never touched a wallet, don't know what Morpho is, and have no interest in learning.<p>What we do today: Users deposit euros via cooinbase pay. We convert to USDC, split their deposit across multiple isolated Morpho vaults on Base chain (each with different collateral types and borrowers pledging 150-200% of what they receive), and they earn 4-7% APY. They see one number: their balance growing daily. No wallet, no gas fees, no tokens. We have apps built for both iOS and Android, currently in beta.<p>The market context: This category is exploding in the US. Axal (a16z CSX, $2.5M), Nook (Coinbase Ventures, $2.5M, ~7.6% avg APY, built by ex-Coinbase/Uber team), YieldClub ($2.5M), and Aave itself launched a consumer savings app with up to 9% APY and $1M deposit protection. They're all live or in waitlist. They all run on the same proven infrastructure (Morpho has had $8.5B in peak deposits, 25+ audits, backed by $69M from a16z and Coinbase Ventures, used by Société Générale).<p>But they're all US-first. ACH, Plaid, Apple Pay, USD-denominated. Europe 350M+ banking customers sitting at near-zero rates — has no equivalent. In the US you can get 4-5% at Marcus or Wealthfront. In Europe, most banks pay 0.5% or less. The yield gap here is wider, and nobody is serving it.<p>That's our bet. We're also working on EURc (Circle's euro stablecoin) integration so the entire flow stays euro-denominated — no FX exposure. That's something no US competitor can replicate.<p>What we want to build next: An AI agent that automates portfolio allocation based on each user's risk profile. You answer a few questions about risk tolerance, time horizon, goals the agent handles vault selection, rebalancing, entry/exit across DeFi strategies. Think Wealthfront/Betterment for crypto, not another trading bot. The multi-vault architecture on Morpho makes this natural: different risk profiles map to different vault compositions.<p>Where I need help:<p>Go-to-market for non-crypto users in Europe: Our target is the person with €10-50K in a savings account earning nothing, not crypto Twitter degens. Every crypto marketing channel attracts the wrong audience. We're running a waitlist with tiered bonuses (+2% APY for first 500 users, referral bonuses), but how do you actually reach normal savers? Has anyone cracked fintech distribution in Europe without burning cash on Meta/Google ads (which are restricted for crypto anyway)?<p>Driving traffic to the site: SEO/GEO is slow, content marketing takes months to compound, paid ads for crypto are a minefield. What's actually moved the needle for early-stage fintech in Europe? We're bootstrapped, so capital-efficient channels matter.<p>Trust for non-crypto users: We lead with radical transparency — every user gets a public on-chain link showing every deposit, earning, and withdrawal. We put risk disclaimers front and center (\"this is not a bank account, never deposit what you can't afford to lose\"). But is that enough? What trust signals actually convert skeptical Europeans?<p>The stablecoin savings app category is being defined right now. YC literally listed \"stablecoin financial services\" in their latest Requests for Startups. We think Europe is the bigger opportunity — the yield gap is wider and nobody's building here yet. Would love to hear from anyone who's built in this space.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Reusing is second best. If we did make something, the best thing to do is get as much use out of it as possible to prevent it from ever becoming trash. Recycling is the last resort. Regardless of what is being recycled, it is an expensive and difficult process to try to salvage any value from the waste materials rather than just abandoning them. Because recycling electronics is such a difficult problem, if we want to reduce e-waste a better idea is to increase our efforts to reduce and reuse them as much as possible. Installing Linux on an old laptop to keep it useful for somebody is easy to do, and much more effective than trying to recycle it. reply",

For example, is the legislation you're thinking of like the deprecation of plastic bags for paper? Or something that covers a much wider amount of consumption? (C) If (A) is \"yes\" or (B) is \"more global\", at huge scales like an economy, legislating quotas or rationing or anything at all, in practice pushes activity onto black markets.

          "text": "In addition to the volume issue, there's the composition issue.  When I was a kid, we recycled all our flint cores.  Well, not quite that far back...  Milk came in glass bottles, and the person who delivered the bottles of milk to our house picked up the empties to take back to the dairy.  There were also steel cans for canned food and soft drinks (which eventually rusts away), and of course lots of other glass bottles.  Now more and more of those kinds of things come in plastic, of which little gets recycled.  And cans are often aluminum, which doesn't rust away. Furniture was wood and fabric and (maybe) springs, with a little bit of pressboard (which was itself recycled paper and textile, usually used on the back of desks etc.).  Now furniture is particleboard (made from sawdust), with lots of glue and some kind of plastic veneer if it's in a place that shows.  Wood is genuinely recyclable (or re-usable as antiques!); I don't think particleboard is recyclable, although I could be wrong. Automobiles were steel, fabric, glass and copper wire (with rubber insulation); plus of course rubber tires.  Now they are those things plus a lot more plastic.  Tires, both then and now, are essentially un-recyclable (although occasionally turned into artificial reefs). I could go on, but there are probably more authoritative (= better) studies of this.  But I suspect in general that we have lots less recyclable \"stuff\" these days than we used to. reply",

          "text": "The ultimate reason is there isn't economic reason so.  It cost's a lot to recycle anything, and most electronics would net you almost nothing valuable. Let's look at an example.  Let's say your phones main board, which will net a few hundred grams of raw materials.  First thing by weight the actual board itself is probably the biggest,  if you could perfectly decompose it to it's parts you would have some fiberglass, glue, a few grams of copper, and maybe a trace amount of gold. Next you would have the different components, mostly ICs but let's cover them next.  These are mostly plastic with bits of copper, tin, and other more exotic metals. Most of these could be used again, if you can separate them and sort them.  There would be a bunch of solder, which maybe could be reused, if you remix it with more flux.  Finally, you'll have chips, these could be reused, but only as replacements for the same chip.  Getting anything out of these would mostly be removing the bulk of the material which is silicon that's been contaminated with other elements to make the semiconductors.  I don't think there is any process right now that could take doped Si and get you anything back.  Besides the silicon you have micrograms of gold and other conductors. Having put all that down, I think there could be an opportunity to take the bulk components off boards, test and sort them, and sell them in bulk. reply",

Many times the only viable option to fix something is to swap a board, or replace the entire item, instead of replacing the one failed component that caused the board to fail, or reflowing the board etc.. Many components also do not offer batteries that can be replaced, such as the magic mouse, so you end up needing to replace the entire item. It's interesting how as certain things age, such as cars, cottage industries pop up to do just that when new replacement boards and parts are not available. The other issue is cost cutting. Many components are made cheaply and fail pre-maturely. Great examples of this are mains voltage LED bulbs where the rectifier circuits that power the LED's fail, but the only real option is to replace the entire thing, creating a lot of e-waste in the process. reply",

I think we're better off lobbying for better standards to communicate the quality of a bulb's design.  The whole reason we have crappy LED bulbs to begin with is because the $3 overdriven bulb with crap components jammed into a tiny enclosure looks like a better deal on the shelf than a bulky $20 bulb with a large heat sink and lower output. And the labor required to do component level repair is wildly expensive and limited (YouTubers who do it on principle notwithstanding), even further narrowing that window. reply",

Not that I think lightbulbs are probably worth saving, but expand it to any other device which gets exponentially more complex and it is easy to see why they don't get diagnosed, not to mention repaired. With a board diagram I can point at a spot on the board and say \"I should see 15 volts here\", without a board diagram i gotta draw out and figure out how the power supply even works so I know what it is suppose to be outputting and then trace that all the way to the test point to make sure there isn't other crap inline before then that might change what I see. reply",

If it is cheap to replace, they will just get a new one.  If it was a big investment, then it's important enough to call a professional to fix.  In the middle ground you've got people who will ask their handy nephew to try to fix it before they run out to the store, and he'll open it up and look for a blown fuse or a loose wire before giving up.  The type of people who can do board level repairs are so rare as to be completely irrelevant to the waste stream of electronics.

Appliance repair use to be big business. Did it stop being so because washers and TVs and vacuums became too complicated to understand, or the parts went up in cost, or because $1000 is considered cheap enough of a device to be considered disposable? No. They stopped existing because appliances stopped coming with the reference materials to repair them in a reasonable time and parts are obfuscated from their source so people don't even know what their broken part is half the time. Is that a thermistor, a capacitor, a diode that blew up? Have fun spending the next 2 hours tracing the obfuscated part number down through 5 different suppliers to figure it out because you obviously can't test a broken part and there is no schematic to look at and identify it from. reply",

They have fewer mechanical parts prone to regular failure or which pay the bills for repair shops (belts, timers, etc) 4. They are far more complicated than their predecessors, and therefore more complicated to diagnose even if you have a schematic But yeah, when everyone’s washing machine has a belt transmission and a clunky mechanical timer, they failed all the time and there were repair shops on every corner.

          "text": "There was a cartel, but this is one of those \"more complicated than it appears\" situations. In incandescent bulbs, there is a real tradeoff between durability of the bulb, efficiency (lumens/watt), and brightness/quality of the light, for physics reasons you _can't_ improve one without degrading the other. Since \"quality of light\" is a very difficult thing to market, there was an incentive to push \"lifetime of the bulb\" in marketing and just make the light quality increasingly worse. The cartel attempted to halt that by making everyone agree on a lifetime/quality to hit and not participate in a race to the bottom (and yes, there was also the obvious benefit to the cartel members of increased sales and profits, which they explicitly talked about in internal documents). I want to be very clear that I'm anti cartels and I'm not trying to say \"so this was all hunky dory\", just that this was not (and these things very rarely are) a simple case of \"they made the product objectively worse for the sole sake of more money\". Instead, they chose a different point on the pareto-frontier of brightness/efficiency/lifespan that also had the benefit of making them more money. But yes, LED bulbs are currently mostly garbage and have terrible heat/power management electronics which means that in practice you almost never get anywhere close to the theoretical life span increases (because the electronics die from overheating far before the actual LEDs themselves would go out), and finding out information on how well a given bulb brand does on heat/power management is essentially impossible. reply",

The obvious Nash Equilibrium involves increasingly hot/bright/efficient bulbs and as much lying about lifetime as a typical consumer would accept, which is a lot. The idea behind the Phoebus Cartel was to force honesty on the dimension where it was most likely to disappear. You are free to disapprove of this and reject bulb lifetime policing, but if so you support the \"everybody lies\" alternative. Pick your poison. reply",

The truth is that they become hazardous waste, and lock away valuable resources inside of trash.

Electronics are the exact opposite of this: they’re highly heterogenous, with bits of material scattered all over the place. Also, most of that material isn’t particularly valuable: silicon is literally as abundant as sand. So all you can really do is melt it all into slag or dissolve it in acid and then try to extract the trace amounts of valuable bits like gold, but this is so energy-intensive for so little material that it’s not worth it at any reasonable material price. reply",
