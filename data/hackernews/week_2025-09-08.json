      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">So I've been trying to actually take notes with obsidian and I can't figure out how. let's say I am a newcomer to astronomy and I begin to look into the topic through popscience videos or short articles, every time I come across a new thing to learn I make a note as such:<p><pre><code>    The zenith is the center of the night sky and it is used for orienting.. so on and so forth\n</code></pre>\nMaybe even throw in a couple of links to other notes for good mesure.<p>As I assemble more and more info, what differentiates my vault from a local-copy of wikipedia? I mean sure it's not a word for word copy ( I always try to use my own words as much as possible) but is it any better?<p>And if being similar to wikipedia isn't a problem, then what constitutes as learning? having a copy of wikipedia on-hand definitely is not learning. so do I take a look at these notes every couple of days and call it a day, or take a test on the subject as if it was a college course?<p>This happens for me with other subjects too, for example a couple of weeks ago I wanted to get really knowledgable about greek mythology so I picked up mythos by Stephan Fry (great book btw) and again I was unsure about how to take notes on it.<p>my intuition said to briefly explain in the form of short bullet points the plot point of each sub story in the book as well as detailing the relationships between different gods mentioned in the book. I guess that's better that not taking notes at all, but is my written relationship guide really better then the 10s of graphical ones available online?<p>I used to know how to take notes for school because I got used to the structure of exams in different subjects thanks to the decade+ being a student but when it comes to free-form learning where there isn't a test or any tangible way to mesure progress I lose sight of how to take notes/learn</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "If you lookup some info on the Zettelkasten method, that is effectively what Obsidian is designed for when it comes to linking. For me, Zettelkasten seems like way too much work, and the goals of it are not my goals. So while I do use Obsidian, I don’t use Zettelkasten, I never use the graph view, and I have very few links. For it to really pay off seems like you need to turn your notes into your digital garden. What’s really wild is the guy who came up with the system did it by hand with index cards, if I remember correctly. Obsidian isn’t too opinionated, and there are a lot of plugins, so you can make it into whatever works for you. Zettelkasten disciples have some impressive looking graph views, but I do question how much of that is actually valuable vs procrastination. The tool aside, I wouldn’t worry about there being something online that already exists or is better. The act of doing it yourself helps with the learning process. Any time I made a cheat sheet in college for a test they allowed it, I never needed it. The act of making it got me to learn it. I saw an interview with someone recently who said they still write book reports as an adult, like they did in grade school, because it helps them learn the lessons of the book and organize their thoughts around it. All of this takes a decent amount of discipline when there is no external force holding you accountable. If it’s worth it or not really depends on the person and topic. reply",

          "text": "Taking notes from books is for the birds,  you can always go back to the book.  The counterexample to that is you might be writing some kind of critique or analysis and this is your first draft -- in this case you might want to record your emotional reactions or personal experiences relevant to the text, citations to other works that are related,  the results you get \"reading between the lines\". etc. Taking notes from lectures depends on the course.  You can't go back to the lecture,  plus you might believe it's a guide to what is on the text.  It depends on how much is the whim of the teacher.  In a lit class,  take notes. If it is introductory chem you can probably get it all from the book and the problem sets.  [1] When you're doing original research though,  it is all about the notes.  I filled up about 30 notebooks in the process of getting my PhD,  you really should document every little thing that you try. People do it less but you should do the same if you are doing any kind of engineering.  Not least if you want to file a patent you want your whole invention process documented so you can prove you invented it. Even in programming you should keep a notebook of your thought process and debugging.  Personally I find I write better quality code when I work with an LLM because it forces me to take better notes. [1] I wound up taking intro chem when I was a senior and a better student and got the top score in the class even though I rarely attended it.  It did get a tiny bit of help:  the prof told us we could skip one quiz,  I did,  then went to the chem lab to ask the T.A. to skip the test,  he said \"Why not take it right here?\" and he looked at it and handed it back to me and said \"Are you sure about that?\" I thought it through again and realized my mistake. reply",

          "text": "Hear me out. Try the following techniques: - note-taking by hand (including analog mind-mapping); - rewriting/reorganizing your notes once or twice, again by hand; - writing a succinct, ELI12 explanation of the subject, again by hand (a/k/a the Feynman method), then later trying to do it again from memory, and comparing the version from memory to the original to see what you forgot to include. Sometimes making and reviewing voice recordings of you explaining everything aloud can work similarly, but there is something special about handwriting. Once you've actually learned everything, you can put it into a spaced recall system like Anki to actively recall/review periodically to prevent forgetting, but at that point it should be pretty well internalized. I find Obsidian and its ilk good to store, link, and share a \"final product\" of something you have already learned. That final product can also be original work based on something you already know and have internalized — but at that point you're an expert. In my experience, trying to use Obsidian to do the learning and the memorization/internalization is barking up the wrong tree. reply",

Are reproducible builds and supply-chain audits enough to trust the binaries? No. But for most applications trust isn't really required. What strategies exist for spotting subtle backdoors in such large codebases? It's not hard. For big projects, contributors are usually a tight-knit group that heavily scrutinize any outsider PRs. By creating a rigorous system of code review (and implementing reminders for bad dependencies) you can deter backdoors decently well. For hardware, how do you approach the risk of compromised firmware, microcode, or hidden subsystems You cannot. Do projects like Coreboot, Heads, or formally verified kernels meaningfully reduce this risk in practice? No, but if properly configured they can reduce attack surface as-advertised. Beyond reading every line yourself, what’s the best way to build confidence? I know this is a dumb answer, but \"be smart\" will get you a really long ways. Stick to the main roads, don't use software developed by 2 or 3 people if your personal security is paramount.

For reference, they are 8, 10, 12 and VERY smart and they use Ubuntu as their desktop computers and can use flatpak from the command line. Not that I am bragging....<p>And, I would love to NOT spent $400 on just a single ridiculous junky thing from Lowes, and do that for multiple things. My budget is definitely tiny and the journey of building and troubleshooting is what I want for the kids, not necessarily a finished perfect project.<p>I found this site and it looks interesting but I am unsure how well this would work for someone like me and whether I would be able to get it working. The site says \"Only 54 days until Halloween!\"<p>https://www.frightprops.com/pneumatics.html<p>If anyone knows of good projects on GitHub, please let me know?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing.

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

Was a bit annoying, but got it working in the end. Don't know if that improved in later versions, but I honestly also didn't keep up with development since the license change.

A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

Email: bepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I'm a software developer with lots of experience in full stack and backend development. I was most recently a developer at SirusXM Radio until I was laid off recently. The languages I've used the most are Java, C++, Ruby ( Ruby on Rails ), Python, and JavaScript. I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images.

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role.

I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away.

For example, I've led the architecture and implementation of machine-learning pipelines, booking engines, ERP and CRM systems, internal enterprise tools, etc. Additionally, my experience with startups is a significant strength, as I approach every solution I build with the perspective of both users and stakeholders, not only the developer's. Highlights: - Built a real-time ML data annotation platform, directly contributing to the company's revenue, achieving twice as many annotated documents as in the legacy system that was used before. - Reduced heavy loads via carefully architected async pipelines, improving the performance and system resiliency. - Led development of a tour booking engine (React/Next/Django) from architecture to launch. - Comfortable mentoring, reviewing, and guiding teams while shipping clean, tested, and extendable code.

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking. On the service-side, I’ve worked with traditional service hosting, containers, and serverless, including (but not limited to) AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Workers, CloudFormation, SAM CLI, nodejs, bunjs, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, grpc, Redis, Docker, nginx, and a few legacy tools best left unnamed (yes, including CodeIgniter and ftp). I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph.

          "text": "Even if your observations/findings are brilliant, you can't be taken seriously unless you're published in an academic journal and you can't do that \"cold.\" Basically, the prerequisites are: 1) You have to speak the language and 2) You have to know some people. #1 Know the Language - Let's say you believe you have a new mathematical proof. Even if it was perfectly valid, you'd get instantly rejected for publishing if it wasn't formatted correctly, used accepted language and definitions of things, was sufficiently rigorous and referenced relevant prior work. That's tough for an amateur to pull off by themselves. So, one solution is to take your best attempt at a rigorous amateur proof to a mathematician at a local college or university. Even a curious grad student in the field who is willing to indulge you can help clean up the work. As a bonus, that can help with problem #2 - knowing some people. If your proof, now translated to proper mathematician-speak, holds water maybe you can leverage your proof-reader to \"level-up\" and get your proof seen by an actual professor in the field who can lend you some credibility and get you introduced to other mathematicians. Even then, your chances of getting published are near zero. However, the recent example of two high-school students who came up with a novel proof of the Pythagorean theorem shows how it can be done. They first were able to present a \"poster\" of their proof at a conference where it was seen by mathematicians and where they could be quizzed about it on the spot. Surviving that gauntlet PLUS the exposure allowed them to catch the eye of a publisher willing to take a chance on them. reply",

          "text": "Not a theoretical physics / pure math example, but Yann Collett is a example of someone who had a day job as a project manager, and did programming as one hobby, and ended up developing the LZ4 & ZStandard compression algorithms.  Yann first started looking at compression algorithms after developing a game for the HP 48S graphics calculator, but it was a large 50kb game and would take too long to download. there's a great interview here: https://corecursive.com/data-compression-yann-collet/#pickin... Part of what helped Yann was finding a niche community of people with the same interest, developing new compression algorithms, where he could be part of that community: > I was not alone and that’s very important I think. But more importantly, I think it gave me a frame of reference. I could compare, I could get evaluated. And so there was a sense of belonging to a tribe of peers and I think it matters because it’s difficult to sustain such a long effort, multi years effort with no such contacts at all. >  Every once in a while someone would come and say, “Hey, I invented this.” And some people would test it and would say, oh, it’s good or it’s great or it’s not. And there would be no shortage of people who like me are interested in data compression and would test the program. Oh, that’s a perfect ground. Part of Yann's success in contributing something novel was having a different goal to most people > I think it’s fair to say that in the data compression community, most searcher were interested in data compression, really best ratio. And speed, yes, as a side effect. Let’s make it not too bad. That really comes second. And my mind was refocused on I want great speed and without sacrificing speed, I want to get better compression ratio. So it really changed the perspective of what matters. And it doesn’t take too long before I got something competitive and at some point also by chance I have an algorithm which seems to be the fastest around. So that’s LZ4. I think there's a lot of overlap with brudgers comment about fields being shared human endeavors, undertaken by communities. You need to figure out how to be part of the relevant community. For a field like theoretical physics, the cost of admission is probably grad school in theoretical physics. reply",

So I’m concerned about how we can use AI in a proactive and critical-thinking way, rather than passively, both in coding and in everyday life. And is it possible to maintain the same productivity expectations? For example, I'm currently working on a toy project, and I'm much slower without AI. rather than create a small MVP with Claude and then refine it.</div>",

          "text": "I personally think stopping the use of AI is silly. I mean you could apply this logic to everything that you would be using specialized tools for, to make life better. Why would you use a car? studies show walking is better.\nWhy would you use a calculator? studies show mental math sharpens your brain.\nWhy would you type on a computer? studies show writing on a physical paper is better for you. Fundamentally people tend to use AI to get a result and then just use it instead of critically thinking over it. It makes sense, we take the path of least resistance. Why care about how something works when it just works? This leads to cognitive decline. Rather I propose that you use AI as one of the greatest search engines ever invented. Think of AI (LLMs) as a dataset of fixed knowledge that can talk back to you and actually help you find the information you want. When I was looking into making selenium scripts, that I had to write for work, more robust, I came up with a solution to create an object for each page and use that object to navigate and interact with the page. I then had a conversation with gemini pro regarding this where it told me that, what I am trying to achieve is technically just Page Object Model (POM), a pre-existing concept in the world of test automation. This lead to a deep dive into the advantages/disadvantages and I then pitched it as a change to better write selenium code and it was accepted at work. Likewise, you should not use AI to vomit you code but as a rubber duck that quacks back at you [0] [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging reply",

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

It’s totally fine if plans change and you decide not to move forward with a candidate, but I think a short email isn’t too much to ask after spending multiple hours on the various interviews.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Stack Overflow was once a haven for tech questions &amp; explanations in the early 10's. At some point, the mod team soured and started deputizing members that started shunning and deleting comments for thinly justified reasoning. Things like asking a question that was asked 8 years ago would get your question deleted, ignoring the fact that tech reasonably could have changed in those 8 years. The site was not only generally toxic, it was difficult to actually use. Searching on google your question \"stack overflow\" was the main use case in the late 10's. LLM's have been the final nail in the coffin for SO, and the usage charts reflect this. Why bother carefully searching and phrasing your question to get a sassy answer 8 hours later, when Claude will give you an answer in 5 seconds with approximately the same accuracy of an internet stranger?<p>So - is Reddit headed the same way as SO? The mods of individual subreddits have been toxic for ages. Political subs curate hive minds, niche topics exclude members that are less informed, etc. Reddit admins, the ones that are emplyoed by the site, are also generally anti-user. Banning members without cause, poor or no explanations of  what the ban is for and generally just policing with an iron fist &amp; a rubber brain.<p>Reddit fills a different niche from SO, being more entertainment focused. But I feel it's the same mistaken model of moderation that will lead to the same demise in ~5 years.<p>Thoughts?</p></p></p></div>",

And only then they present with the options - whether to turn the special features on or off.<p>It reads like you're agreeing to the data use regardless of whether you actually enable the features. The detailed documentation suggests data is only used when features are enabled, but that opening sentence creates blanket consent language.<p>Is this intentionally misleading UX copy, or just sloppy writing that creates legal ambiguity?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I did it for about a year, in kind of a hybrid product owner / scrum master role. I was filling a gap due to a rather toxic product owner that the whole team wanted out. I expected I could keep working on some user stories as well, but that wasn’t realistic. I think having the background in development makes things much easier, as you’ll actually understand what’s going on. My current scrum master has no idea what we’re talking about and can’t speak to anything we’re doing, which is a problem. My biggest piece of advice in a role like that is to show up to meetings prepared. Starting a meeting with an empty sheet often ends with an empty sheet. Spending the time to put together some kind of framework to organize thoughts, even as a jumping off point, pays dividends. Build systems for the team and eventually things hum along pretty smoothly. I ended up switching back into a dev role. While the team was considered successful, and the team members seemed happy, I was miserable. I’m a bit of a perfectionist, which is a burden I’m used to placing on myself, but wasn’t something I felt comfortable pushing on other people, because I know the weight of it. This led me to not give feedback I should have given, or letting work go that was “good enough,” but really should have been better. The work wasn’t up to my standards, and I was accountable for it, even though it wasn’t work I personally did. This slowly drove me mad, even though all external feedback was glowing. This is just a long way to say, know yourself, but also that it may simply take time to adapt and grow into the role. It’s a big mental shift, at least it was for me. Going back has also been a bit rough. I did find it to be useful to be on that side of the house for a while. It gave me a little more empathy for people in those roles. I was pretty hard on them in the past and have eased up a lot. reply",

          "text": "I studied to be an IT specialist at the Polytechnic University, I thought to connect my life closely with IT, time has shown that there are IT specialists under every bush, even a dried-up one, as my son was born in 2008, then in August the crisis hit, the soap bubble burst, and I flew abroad to earn money, since at home the prices for my services fell threefold, and I worked as a caretaker, then a warehouse manager, a part-time foreman for 15 years, the coronavirus ruined my health, then the war (I'm from Ukraine), well, and now I'm unemployed, and no one needs IT here. If you live in a peaceful state, my advice to you is to learn to bake bread, cook, or drive a truck, or if you have a medical education, become a paramedic. The world always needs food, logistics, or medicine. if you are a complete idiot - go to a construction site, they pay well there, and you will not work 16 hours a day like any IT specialist (don't tell me that you work 8 hours, I won't believe you, an IT specialist thinks only about IT all the time, both at work and after work, even on the toilet, and during meals). when I moved away from IT I felt freedom, I could think not about IT, I worked only the time I was at work, I didn't think about work outside of work at all, because work remains at work, and that's great. reply",

Save yourself from confusion and waste of time, and read/skim through the Pro Git book. It has very good diagrams explaining the workings of git. As of 2025, the book is a bit dated for the very latest (unnecessary?) commands of git, but the basics are still the same. That said, git is the de facto version control tool in the industry, but I prefer Fossil for my personal projects. Nothing beats the timeline view and other simple tools and easy customizability in Fossil. reply",

I thought it was a very sophisticated system of file version management that very carefully measured deltas between versions of files, and stored only those deltas . If you believe this, you'll experience nothing but grief with Git, because that's not what it is. It actually stores everything you tell it to, and can optionally compress it down to deltas. The storage at the root is all content based, instead of file name based, so if you have 5000 different names for the exact same 1 megabyte of stuff, you'll only store it once, along with all the names (and other metadata it uses internally). reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Does anyone know of good resources to make your own animatronic Halloween displays?<p>I'm a software engineer, and not skilled in hardware per se.<p>I would love to make some things together with my kids. For reference, they are 8, 10, 12 and VERY smart and they use Ubuntu as their desktop computers and can use flatpak from the command line. Not that I am bragging....<p>And, I would love to NOT spent $400 on just a single ridiculous junky thing from Lowes, and do that for multiple things. My budget is definitely tiny and the journey of building and troubleshooting is what I want for the kids, not necessarily a finished perfect project.<p>I found this site and it looks interesting but I am unsure how well this would work for someone like me and whether I would be able to get it working. The site says \"Only 54 days until Halloween!\"<p>https://www.frightprops.com/pneumatics.html<p>If anyone knows of good projects on GitHub, please let me know?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It is largely not different than a \"custom\" setup because it's always some patched together job of various plugins to the point that it becomes brittle and difficult to work with. I get the sense that technical people think it is more straightforward and prescribe it to people, but any non-technical person I've worked with is utterly lost in it. I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing. Somewhere around 15 years ago, I thought wordpress was viable, but I think we need to leave it in the dust. I worked with it again 5 years ago, and the situation was no different from what I could tell. reply",

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

Currently having 20+ sites running this setup for clients and never hit an issue \"modeling\" the data as Decap config, widgets (also custom ones), can allow pretty much anything. One downside for this setup, is that uploaded media are not re-sized or compressed (since there is no backend job doing it), so a client must be briefed into \"making smaller images\" (on the web client side with squoosh.app[2] for example), or using a SSG that does that built-in (hugo, gatsby) 0. https://github.com/sveltia 1. https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/#client-side-pkce-a... 2. https://squoosh.app reply",

A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

Email: bepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I'm a software developer with lots of experience in full stack and backend development. I was most recently a developer at SirusXM Radio until I was laid off recently. The languages I've used the most are Java, C++, Ruby ( Ruby on Rails ), Python, and JavaScript. I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

In general I want to advance the frontier of what's possible. My credentials are more towards research engineering than applied work, but I'm open to both. My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images.

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading. reply",

Highlights: - Built a real-time ML data annotation platform, directly contributing to the company's revenue, achieving twice as many annotated documents as in the legacy system that was used before. - Reduced heavy loads via carefully architected async pipelines, improving the performance and system resiliency. - Led development of a tour booking engine (React/Next/Django) from architecture to launch. - Comfortable mentoring, reviewing, and guiding teams while shipping clean, tested, and extendable code.

We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we're looking for someone who isn't afraid to jump into something you haven't used before.

We're bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team. Building dev tools is great! We're solving problems we've experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.

          "text": "Spacelift | Remote (Europe) | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer | $80k-$110k+ (can go higher) We're a VC-funded startup (recently raised $51M Series C) building an infrastructure orchestrator and collaborative management platform for Infrastructure-as-Code – from OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Kubernetes, to Ansible. On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack. Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://careers.spacelift.io/jobs/3006934-software-engineer-... You can find out more about the product we're building at https://spacelift.io and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: https://spacelift.io/blog/engineering Additionally , we're hiring for a new product we're building, Flows[0]. Mostly the same requirements and tech stack, without the devops bits. If you'd like to apply specifically for that, just mention \"new product\" in the cover letter field.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

Radios make you a target, satellites aren’t guaranteed, and brittle legacy networks won’t survive future fights. What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments. Who we are looking for: - Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security. - Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP. - Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment. You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators. About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen).

We had even been talking about the exact salary package and start date, decided to talk again in a couple of weeks about the specifics, but then I never heard back, despite reaching out to you again. It’s totally fine if plans change and you decide not to move forward with a candidate, but I think a short email isn’t too much to ask after spending multiple hours on the various interviews. That said, the interview process was otherwise pretty good and the work you’re doing sounds really interesting, so I would still encourage others to apply. Best of luck with Formal! reply",

Our API lets any AI app or agent add shopping capabilities and earn commission on sales. As commerce moves from in-store, to online, to AI-native, this universal product catalog becomes critical infrastructure.

We're live with 500+ developers on our API and millions of products processed daily. We're looking for engineers who want direct ownership of technical decisions, love solving hard problems at scale, and want to help build our team and culture from the ground up.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">So I've been trying to actually take notes with obsidian and I can't figure out how. let's say I am a newcomer to astronomy and I begin to look into the topic through popscience videos or short articles, every time I come across a new thing to learn I make a note as such:<p><pre><code>    The zenith is the center of the night sky and it is used for orienting.. so on and so forth\n</code></pre>\nMaybe even throw in a couple of links to other notes for good mesure.<p>As I assemble more and more info, what differentiates my vault from a local-copy of wikipedia? I mean sure it's not a word for word copy ( I always try to use my own words as much as possible) but is it any better?<p>And if being similar to wikipedia isn't a problem, then what constitutes as learning? having a copy of wikipedia on-hand definitely is not learning. so do I take a look at these notes every couple of days and call it a day, or take a test on the subject as if it was a college course?<p>This happens for me with other subjects too, for example a couple of weeks ago I wanted to get really knowledgable about greek mythology so I picked up mythos by Stephan Fry (great book btw) and again I was unsure about how to take notes on it.<p>my intuition said to briefly explain in the form of short bullet points the plot point of each sub story in the book as well as detailing the relationships between different gods mentioned in the book. I guess that's better that not taking notes at all, but is my written relationship guide really better then the 10s of graphical ones available online?<p>I used to know how to take notes for school because I got used to the structure of exams in different subjects thanks to the decade+ being a student but when it comes to free-form learning where there isn't a test or any tangible way to mesure progress I lose sight of how to take notes/learn</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "If you lookup some info on the Zettelkasten method, that is effectively what Obsidian is designed for when it comes to linking. For me, Zettelkasten seems like way too much work, and the goals of it are not my goals. So while I do use Obsidian, I don’t use Zettelkasten, I never use the graph view, and I have very few links. For it to really pay off seems like you need to turn your notes into your digital garden. What’s really wild is the guy who came up with the system did it by hand with index cards, if I remember correctly. Obsidian isn’t too opinionated, and there are a lot of plugins, so you can make it into whatever works for you. Zettelkasten disciples have some impressive looking graph views, but I do question how much of that is actually valuable vs procrastination. The tool aside, I wouldn’t worry about there being something online that already exists or is better. The act of doing it yourself helps with the learning process. Any time I made a cheat sheet in college for a test they allowed it, I never needed it. The act of making it got me to learn it. I saw an interview with someone recently who said they still write book reports as an adult, like they did in grade school, because it helps them learn the lessons of the book and organize their thoughts around it. All of this takes a decent amount of discipline when there is no external force holding you accountable. If it’s worth it or not really depends on the person and topic. reply",

Try the following techniques: - note-taking by hand (including analog mind-mapping); - rewriting/reorganizing your notes once or twice, again by hand; - writing a succinct, ELI12 explanation of the subject, again by hand (a/k/a the Feynman method), then later trying to do it again from memory, and comparing the version from memory to the original to see what you forgot to include. Sometimes making and reviewing voice recordings of you explaining everything aloud can work similarly, but there is something special about handwriting. Once you've actually learned everything, you can put it into a spaced recall system like Anki to actively recall/review periodically to prevent forgetting, but at that point it should be pretty well internalized. I find Obsidian and its ilk good to store, link, and share a \"final product\" of something you have already learned. That final product can also be original work based on something you already know and have internalized — but at that point you're an expert. In my experience, trying to use Obsidian to do the learning and the memorization/internalization is barking up the wrong tree. reply",

The counterexample to that is you might be writing some kind of critique or analysis and this is your first draft -- in this case you might want to record your emotional reactions or personal experiences relevant to the text, citations to other works that are related,  the results you get \"reading between the lines\". etc. Taking notes from lectures depends on the course.  You can't go back to the lecture,  plus you might believe it's a guide to what is on the text.  It depends on how much is the whim of the teacher.  In a lit class,  take notes. If it is introductory chem you can probably get it all from the book and the problem sets.  [1] When you're doing original research though,  it is all about the notes.  I filled up about 30 notebooks in the process of getting my PhD,  you really should document every little thing that you try. People do it less but you should do the same if you are doing any kind of engineering.  Not least if you want to file a patent you want your whole invention process documented so you can prove you invented it. Even in programming you should keep a notebook of your thought process and debugging.  Personally I find I write better quality code when I work with an LLM because it forces me to take better notes. [1] I wound up taking intro chem when I was a senior and a better student and got the top score in the class even though I rarely attended it.  It did get a tiny bit of help:  the prof told us we could skip one quiz,  I did,  then went to the chem lab to ask the T.A. to skip the test,  he said \"Why not take it right here?\" and he looked at it and handed it back to me and said \"Are you sure about that?\" I thought it through again and realized my mistake. reply",

          "text": "In school, you can take notes and learn enough to pass pretend problems on next week’s test. In the adult world it ain’t that way. There’s no test next week and knowledge is not applied to pretend problems. Often it is not relevant to any problem and when it is, the relevant knowledge is based on years of experience. Maybe look at it this way, what kind of problem is solved by knowing what the zenith is and how do you wind up in a position where that problem is relevant, meaningful, and important to society except through years of training and work experience? Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with edification. But adult standards for knowing things are often higher. Even one-eyed kings in lands of the blind are kings because they have useful knowledge. Trivia is just trivia. Time is the price of adult knowledge. Synthesis is the value. Aging comes with “how the hell did I do that?” because that’s the nature of up-to-the-ass-in-alligators work. If you leave the swamp you can’t do swamp work. So some advice: if you want to use what works in school, go back to school. If you want a lifetime of learning, pursue intellectual challenges that don’t have one right answer. Fortunately, that’s most things. Unfortunately, doing so won’t feel safe and comfortable. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "I personally think stopping the use of AI is silly. I mean you could apply this logic to everything that you would be using specialized tools for, to make life better. Why would you use a car? studies show walking is better.\nWhy would you use a calculator? studies show mental math sharpens your brain.\nWhy would you type on a computer? studies show writing on a physical paper is better for you. Fundamentally people tend to use AI to get a result and then just use it instead of critically thinking over it. It makes sense, we take the path of least resistance. Why care about how something works when it just works? This leads to cognitive decline. Rather I propose that you use AI as one of the greatest search engines ever invented. Think of AI (LLMs) as a dataset of fixed knowledge that can talk back to you and actually help you find the information you want. When I was looking into making selenium scripts, that I had to write for work, more robust, I came up with a solution to create an object for each page and use that object to navigate and interact with the page. I then had a conversation with gemini pro regarding this where it told me that, what I am trying to achieve is technically just Page Object Model (POM), a pre-existing concept in the world of test automation. This lead to a deep dive into the advantages/disadvantages and I then pitched it as a change to better write selenium code and it was accepted at work. Likewise, you should not use AI to vomit you code but as a rubber duck that quacks back at you [0] [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging reply",

A typewriter from 1930 has the same layout roughly as your laptop. The AI you use today will change in 30-90 days time and be different. In addition just 5-10 companies in the world can create AI that you use for work vs. decent competition in regular computer space with a FOSS operating system and kernel available. Local AI is possible but not in the same league. To boot these tools are VC subsidised with no profitability plan. You are the product again. reply",

But to start your journey, you first need to free your mind of the ideas you have about productivity. The journey you are asking about is one of unsteady progress, of long slogs and flashes of brilliant inspiration. It is a journey without known destination, and one who undertakes journeys into the wilderness must be wiley and shrewd and accepting that their voyaging will proceed at a walking pace not a sprint. It will involve deep reflection and self-knowledge and having faith in your beliefs. You will learn to read subtle signs and pass seemingly impassable obstacles.

          "text": "Kali Linux is a pentesting distro. It's not claimed to be secure and AFAIK it makes deliberately insecure design decisions to enable spoofing/SDR attacks. Are reproducible builds and supply-chain audits enough to trust the binaries? No. But for most applications trust isn't really required. What strategies exist for spotting subtle backdoors in such large codebases? It's not hard. For big projects, contributors are usually a tight-knit group that heavily scrutinize any outsider PRs. By creating a rigorous system of code review (and implementing reminders for bad dependencies) you can deter backdoors decently well. For hardware, how do you approach the risk of compromised firmware, microcode, or hidden subsystems You cannot. Do projects like Coreboot, Heads, or formally verified kernels meaningfully reduce this risk in practice? No, but if properly configured they can reduce attack surface as-advertised. Beyond reading every line yourself, what’s the best way to build confidence? I know this is a dumb answer, but \"be smart\" will get you a really long ways. Stick to the main roads, don't use software developed by 2 or 3 people if your personal security is paramount. Keep your systems slim and minimally networked, route any home servers through a VPN or proxy to prevent it from being harassed on the open internet. reply",

          "text": "Even if your observations/findings are brilliant, you can't be taken seriously unless you're published in an academic journal and you can't do that \"cold.\" Basically, the prerequisites are: 1) You have to speak the language and 2) You have to know some people. #1 Know the Language - Let's say you believe you have a new mathematical proof. Even if it was perfectly valid, you'd get instantly rejected for publishing if it wasn't formatted correctly, used accepted language and definitions of things, was sufficiently rigorous and referenced relevant prior work. That's tough for an amateur to pull off by themselves. So, one solution is to take your best attempt at a rigorous amateur proof to a mathematician at a local college or university. Even a curious grad student in the field who is willing to indulge you can help clean up the work. As a bonus, that can help with problem #2 - knowing some people. If your proof, now translated to proper mathematician-speak, holds water maybe you can leverage your proof-reader to \"level-up\" and get your proof seen by an actual professor in the field who can lend you some credibility and get you introduced to other mathematicians. Even then, your chances of getting published are near zero. However, the recent example of two high-school students who came up with a novel proof of the Pythagorean theorem shows how it can be done. They first were able to present a \"poster\" of their proof at a conference where it was seen by mathematicians and where they could be quizzed about it on the spot. Surviving that gauntlet PLUS the exposure allowed them to catch the eye of a publisher willing to take a chance on them. reply",

          "text": "Not a theoretical physics / pure math example, but Yann Collett is a example of someone who had a day job as a project manager, and did programming as one hobby, and ended up developing the LZ4 & ZStandard compression algorithms.  Yann first started looking at compression algorithms after developing a game for the HP 48S graphics calculator, but it was a large 50kb game and would take too long to download. there's a great interview here: https://corecursive.com/data-compression-yann-collet/#pickin... Part of what helped Yann was finding a niche community of people with the same interest, developing new compression algorithms, where he could be part of that community: > I was not alone and that’s very important I think. But more importantly, I think it gave me a frame of reference. I could compare, I could get evaluated. And so there was a sense of belonging to a tribe of peers and I think it matters because it’s difficult to sustain such a long effort, multi years effort with no such contacts at all. >  Every once in a while someone would come and say, “Hey, I invented this.” And some people would test it and would say, oh, it’s good or it’s great or it’s not. And there would be no shortage of people who like me are interested in data compression and would test the program. Oh, that’s a perfect ground. Part of Yann's success in contributing something novel was having a different goal to most people > I think it’s fair to say that in the data compression community, most searcher were interested in data compression, really best ratio. And speed, yes, as a side effect. Let’s make it not too bad. That really comes second. And my mind was refocused on I want great speed and without sacrificing speed, I want to get better compression ratio. So it really changed the perspective of what matters. And it doesn’t take too long before I got something competitive and at some point also by chance I have an algorithm which seems to be the fastest around. So that’s LZ4. I think there's a lot of overlap with brudgers comment about fields being shared human endeavors, undertaken by communities. You need to figure out how to be part of the relevant community. For a field like theoretical physics, the cost of admission is probably grad school in theoretical physics. reply",

If someone could pencil that out it would be both “no duh!” And a question only an amateur would explore (of course not silly, if there was a relationship we would already know all about it.)

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm curious whether others in the HN community have felt ripple effects from the Gaza war—either directly or indirectly.<p>In Israel, the war has triggered a noticeable academic brain drain, with foreign students and collaborators pulling back from Israeli institutions (Haaretz). In tech, the impact has been even more pronounced: thousands of workers have relocated abroad, especially to the U.S., and investment in Israeli startups has dropped sharply. Some VCs now require Israeli companies to incorporate outside Israel to mitigate perceived risks (Calcalist).<p>At the same time, there's growing tension within global tech companies. Internal protests—especially at firms like Google and Microsoft—have raised questions about how Israeli professionals are perceived, and whether political affiliations or national origin are starting to affect hiring, collaboration, or workplace culture. Google recently fired 28 employees after a sit-in protest over its cloud contract with Israel (The Verge), and Microsoft faced a lockdown after activists occupied its president’s office (NYT).<p>It’s also important to acknowledge that Palestinian professionals and supporters of Palestine may be facing their own challenges. In some cases, expressing solidarity or criticism has led to workplace tensions, reputational risks, or even job insecurity. For many of us who are just observing what is happening online there is also an impact. This can shape how we feel about the historical conflict. These dynamics are complex and vary widely by geography and company culture, but they’re part of the broader picture.<p>For those of you working in tech, academia, or investing:<p>- Have you seen changes in how Israeli or Palestinian colleagues are treated?<p>- Are relocation trends affecting your teams or hiring decisions?<p>- Is internal culture shifting in response to the war or related protests?<p>- Have your opinions changed over the course of the 'war'?<p>Would love to hear perspectives from founders, engineers, researchers, and investors—especially those with ties to Israel, Palestine, or working in globally distributed teams.<p>== sources ==<p>Academic brain drain from Israel\nHaaretz: “Foreign Students Are Fleeing Israeli Universities”\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-20/ty-article/.premium/foreign-students-are-fleeing-israeli-universities/0000019f-2e6e-dc3c-a7df-3f6e2f7b0000<p>Investment decline and relocation in Israeli tech\nCalcalist: “ההייטק הישראלי איבד 8800 עובדים מאז תחילת המלחמה”\nhttps://www.calcalist.co.il/local-news/article/hyq0j00x0c<p>Google employee firings over protest of Israel cloud contract\nThe Verge: “Google fires employees who protested its cloud contract with Israel”\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/google-fires-employees-protest-israel-project-nimbus<p>Microsoft office protest over Israel ties\nNew York Times: “Microsoft Protest Over Israel Ties Ends With Lockdown”\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/technology/microsoft-protest-israel.html</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Arduino-based Halloween projects on GitHub – lots of open-source code for motion + sound effects. YouTube channels like Make:, Animatronics How-To, and DIY Creature Workshop often show step-by-step builds. If you want to go deeper, look into Raspberry Pi-controlled props for more complex movement + audio sync. For something quick and spooky, even a simple PIR motion sensor + servo motor setup can create a fun jump-scare effect. reply",

French company/organisational names appear to be chosen to be \"pronouncable initialisms\" such as IRCAM or INRIA. Australia has the C-S-I-R-O and you can say SI-Rho and some do. But french and americans definitely do this more. There's an ICANN (pronounced I-Can) body called the RSSAC which is AR-SACK. and SSAC which is SEC-SAC. Some initialisms defeat this. the I-E-T-F and the I-E-S-G and the I-A-B for instance. But I-ana is definitely pronounced as an I-word. It's Jif btw. Nobody says \"sea, but bigger\" for C++ and it wasn't called Cplus. reply",

P =|!= NP;\n2.Unification of gen. relativity+quantum mechanics; \n3. prove/disprove the Riemann hypothesis;\n4. \"lonely runner conjecture\" proof/disproof;\n5. cure for 4th stage cancer that works most of the time;\n6. orders of magnitudes colder fusion;\n7. reactionless drive - proof/disproof;\n8. prove(show)/disprove 'quantum supremacy';\n9. install user-friendly main purpose OS on quantum computer;\n10. humanoid defeats ufc fighter in a fight;\n11. humanoid performs parkour better than Storror;\n12. AI designs orders of magnitude faster textgen/mediagen algorithms than transformers without sacrificing quality (or 5-10% worse deviation);\n13. AI builds self-replicating robots that build city on Mars (i stole this idea from Grok month ago or so...);\n14. discovers way to make cheap invitro meat;\n15. synthesizes ununennium;\n16. correct interpretation of quantum mechanics;\n17. solve the 'problem of time';\n18. make glueballs;\n19. prove/reject the Collatz conjecture;<p>and many more...what in your opinion are agi-like problems?<p>I know my phrasing of the problems above isn't perfect, for example \"cheap\" as in invitro meat is open to interpretation and 1 million degrees fusion is still ~2 'orders of magnitude' colder but likely useless to have impact on mainstream fusion etc. But it's an internet forum after all not Ph.d thesis, regardless any of the problems if solved despite the horrible wording will signal an immense paradigma shift in AI or whatever it \"signals\" someone/some people will be doing something very right surpassing even Demis Hassabis, or even Einstein, Da Vinci, Tesla, Ada and the likes.<p>I'm curious what many people want to see from AI, since the IQ of this forum is high, I guess it won't be a beavis-and-butthead level of answers like \"photorealistic fps\" or \"teslas that sound like shelby\" or \"tastier burgers\", \"badass jetpacks\" , \"fully immersive VR where you can interview andrew tate\", \"cabrio boeing\", etc etc.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Synthesia (paid) – best for business/explainer avatar-style videos. Kaiber AI (free trial + paid) – very creative/artistic results. Stable Video Diffusion (open-source) – still experimental, but promising. For free tinkering, Pika and Kaiber are fun. For professional use, Runway or Synthesia is worth the investment.\nWould love to hear what others are using in production. reply",

I have helped companies build scalable and maintainable systems using technologies with a bet of good understanding of their function and documentation (which most people usually don't read).

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

In general I want to advance the frontier of what's possible. My credentials are more towards research engineering than applied work, but I'm open to both. My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images.

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading. reply",

I have strong history building dependable software in environments from startups to large corporations, and I value opportunities to work with new technologies and languages. Growing teams and mentoring junior engineers are also essential skills on my CV. I am detail-oriented (testing and code comments are crucial), and I value effective and kind communication. I bring a mindset focused on reliability even under ambiguous requirements, and I try to do the \"right thing\" even when it's difficult. Right now, as side projects I'm working on writing an emulator in Rust, and an app for some task planning. Feel free to send an email or LinkedIn message!

Highlights: - Built a real-time ML data annotation platform, directly contributing to the company's revenue, achieving twice as many annotated documents as in the legacy system that was used before. - Reduced heavy loads via carefully architected async pipelines, improving the performance and system resiliency. - Led development of a tour booking engine (React/Next/Django) from architecture to launch. - Comfortable mentoring, reviewing, and guiding teams while shipping clean, tested, and extendable code.

It is largely not different than a \"custom\" setup because it's always some patched together job of various plugins to the point that it becomes brittle and difficult to work with. I get the sense that technical people think it is more straightforward and prescribe it to people, but any non-technical person I've worked with is utterly lost in it. I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing. Somewhere around 15 years ago, I thought wordpress was viable, but I think we need to leave it in the dust. I worked with it again 5 years ago, and the situation was no different from what I could tell. reply",

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

Currently having 20+ sites running this setup for clients and never hit an issue \"modeling\" the data as Decap config, widgets (also custom ones), can allow pretty much anything. One downside for this setup, is that uploaded media are not re-sized or compressed (since there is no backend job doing it), so a client must be briefed into \"making smaller images\" (on the web client side with squoosh.app[2] for example), or using a SSG that does that built-in (hugo, gatsby) 0. https://github.com/sveltia 1. https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/#client-side-pkce-a... 2. https://squoosh.app reply",

If you keep your backend on Someone Else's Machine, they can hold your data hostage.

A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

          "text": "From a publishing perspective, the choice of headless CMS often depends on how you plan to scale and distribute content: - Strapi→ great balance of flexibility + control, good for small-to-mid projects.  \n- Contentful→ solid for enterprise-level publishing, but cost is higher.  \n- Sanity→ strong for structured content, especially for editorial teams.  \n- Ghost (headless mode)→ works very well for content-heavy publishing. As a software publisher, I’ve seen Strapi and Ghost perform particularly well for indie and startup-level launches. I recently published a project where Strapi helped reduce time-to-market significantly. Curious what others here are using in 2025! reply",

We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we're looking for someone who isn't afraid to jump into something you haven't used before. You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, built a dancing fountain for fun, that sort of thing) and senior colleagues (eg: Stu went from teaching Python in maths class to reverse-engineering our drag'n'drop editor in months), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We're bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team. Building dev tools is great! We're solving problems we've experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems. We work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon/Fri). If you have questions, I'm a founder and my email's in my profile.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

We are looking for highly independent individuals, who can work in a new, small, but empowered team. What will you be bringing? - Proven experience working on Agentic systems that solve real problems OR Some evidence you have the \"instinct\" Andrew Ng mentions as the differentiators of successful Agent builders.

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments. Who we are looking for: - Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security. - Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP. - Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment. You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators. About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen).

          "text": "I personally think stopping the use of AI is silly. I mean you could apply this logic to everything that you would be using specialized tools for, to make life better. Why would you use a car? studies show walking is better.\nWhy would you use a calculator? studies show mental math sharpens your brain.\nWhy would you type on a computer? studies show writing on a physical paper is better for you. Fundamentally people tend to use AI to get a result and then just use it instead of critically thinking over it. It makes sense, we take the path of least resistance. Why care about how something works when it just works? This leads to cognitive decline. Rather I propose that you use AI as one of the greatest search engines ever invented. Think of AI (LLMs) as a dataset of fixed knowledge that can talk back to you and actually help you find the information you want. When I was looking into making selenium scripts, that I had to write for work, more robust, I came up with a solution to create an object for each page and use that object to navigate and interact with the page. I then had a conversation with gemini pro regarding this where it told me that, what I am trying to achieve is technically just Page Object Model (POM), a pre-existing concept in the world of test automation. This lead to a deep dive into the advantages/disadvantages and I then pitched it as a change to better write selenium code and it was accepted at work. Likewise, you should not use AI to vomit you code but as a rubber duck that quacks back at you [0] [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging reply",

The craft -- the art of coding is known to those who love it as \"hacking\". It's a skill that lives in your eyes and in your fingers. But to start your journey, you first need to free your mind of the ideas you have about productivity. The journey you are asking about is one of unsteady progress, of long slogs and flashes of brilliant inspiration. It is a journey without known destination, and one who undertakes journeys into the wilderness must be wiley and shrewd and accepting that their voyaging will proceed at a walking pace not a sprint. It will involve deep reflection and self-knowledge and having faith in your beliefs. You will learn to read subtle signs and pass seemingly impassable obstacles.

For reference, they are 8, 10, 12 and VERY smart and they use Ubuntu as their desktop computers and can use flatpak from the command line. Not that I am bragging....<p>And, I would love to NOT spent $400 on just a single ridiculous junky thing from Lowes, and do that for multiple things. My budget is definitely tiny and the journey of building and troubleshooting is what I want for the kids, not necessarily a finished perfect project.<p>I found this site and it looks interesting but I am unsure how well this would work for someone like me and whether I would be able to get it working. The site says \"Only 54 days until Halloween!\"<p>https://www.frightprops.com/pneumatics.html<p>If anyone knows of good projects on GitHub, please let me know?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They overtrained and cut out a lot though, and the good stuff was in the API. People thought of AI as rigid and boring, but unbarred, it was a fever dream. Great for brainstorming because it went into places the human brain wouldn't go. Some publicly released stuff I had at the time: https://github.com/smuzani/openai-samples Feel free to go through the history, there's some stuff from before 3.5. My GitHub desc was there to fill a disclaimer requirement by OpenAI for any AI generated code using their API. I keep it for historical reasons. I kept the good stuff private though. At the time I was pissed with Stack Overflow and had hacked together my own personal version which I wired to my terminal. All I got from SO at the time was being closed for being a duplicate of an unrelated question, so AI was a large step ahead. reply",

Email: maguetamarcos[at] gmail [dot] com I'm currently a senior software engineer with 5 years of experience. I've worked extensively with F#, C# and Clojure in distributed systems and I feel at home with functional programming. I have helped companies build scalable and maintainable systems using technologies with a bet of good understanding of their function and documentation (which most people usually don't read). I worked from microservices to monoliths, from Kafka to SQLite; I like to be ecletic in my toolchain, as even if I do not use something directly, there's hardly nothing one can learn from it.

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading. reply",

I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

For example, I've led the architecture and implementation of machine-learning pipelines, booking engines, ERP and CRM systems, internal enterprise tools, etc. Additionally, my experience with startups is a significant strength, as I approach every solution I build with the perspective of both users and stakeholders, not only the developer's. Highlights: - Built a real-time ML data annotation platform, directly contributing to the company's revenue, achieving twice as many annotated documents as in the legacy system that was used before. - Reduced heavy loads via carefully architected async pipelines, improving the performance and system resiliency. - Led development of a tour booking engine (React/Next/Django) from architecture to launch. - Comfortable mentoring, reviewing, and guiding teams while shipping clean, tested, and extendable code. I prefer contract-based, fully remote B2B roles.\nIf you need someone who can take ownership of architecture while executing hands-on, let's talk. reply",

I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing.

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

          "text": "I work for a headless CMS, but I think that's a poor fit for your use case. Many of our small customers start off in your situation, where a helpful dev makes them a headless site. A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have >2000 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We just raised a $50M Series A and are now expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to seasoned backend, data and infrastructure engineers. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem.

Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

Radios make you a target, satellites aren’t guaranteed, and brittle legacy networks won’t survive future fights. What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments. Who we are looking for: - Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security. - Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP. - Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment. You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators. About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen).

We had even been talking about the exact salary package and start date, decided to talk again in a couple of weeks about the specifics, but then I never heard back, despite reaching out to you again. It’s totally fine if plans change and you decide not to move forward with a candidate, but I think a short email isn’t too much to ask after spending multiple hours on the various interviews. That said, the interview process was otherwise pretty good and the work you’re doing sounds really interesting, so I would still encourage others to apply. Best of luck with Formal! reply",

          "text": "Initialism. I have a theory that the french, and americans share a love of taking acronyms/initialisms and finding a way to \"pronounce\" them. French company/organisational names appear to be chosen to be \"pronouncable initialisms\" such as IRCAM or INRIA. Australia has the C-S-I-R-O and you can say SI-Rho and some do. But french and americans definitely do this more. There's an ICANN (pronounced I-Can) body called the RSSAC which is AR-SACK. and SSAC which is SEC-SAC. Some initialisms defeat this. the I-E-T-F and the I-E-S-G and the I-A-B for instance. But I-ana is definitely pronounced as an I-word. It's Jif btw. Nobody says \"sea, but bigger\" for C++ and it wasn't called Cplus. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I guess the nomenclature behind \"AGI\" and \"ASI\" is still debatable and i just watched an interview with Sundar Pichai (on Lex Fridman) where he brilliantly almost mocked the term, essentially describing it as a recent invention, neologism mostly used to mean \"our ai will soon be very advanced\".<p>Even so my question is: what problems as of 2025  September are impossible for even the best AI? \nI can think of many, though since they are currently unsolved, they may as well be impossible regardless for any human or human tool anyway:<p>*here are some problems ordered randomly, \"on top of my head\":<p>1. P =|!= NP;\n2.Unification of gen. relativity+quantum mechanics; \n3. prove/disprove the Riemann hypothesis;\n4. \"lonely runner conjecture\" proof/disproof;\n5. cure for 4th stage cancer that works most of the time;\n6. orders of magnitudes colder fusion;\n7. reactionless drive - proof/disproof;\n8. prove(show)/disprove 'quantum supremacy';\n9. install user-friendly main purpose OS on quantum computer;\n10. humanoid defeats ufc fighter in a fight;\n11. humanoid performs parkour better than Storror;\n12. AI designs orders of magnitude faster textgen/mediagen algorithms than transformers without sacrificing quality (or 5-10% worse deviation);\n13. AI builds self-replicating robots that build city on Mars (i stole this idea from Grok month ago or so...);\n14. discovers way to make cheap invitro meat;\n15. synthesizes ununennium;\n16. correct interpretation of quantum mechanics;\n17. solve the 'problem of time';\n18. make glueballs;\n19. prove/reject the Collatz conjecture;<p>and many more...what in your opinion are agi-like problems?<p>I know my phrasing of the problems above isn't perfect, for example \"cheap\" as in invitro meat is open to interpretation and 1 million degrees fusion is still ~2 'orders of magnitude' colder but likely useless to have impact on mainstream fusion etc. But it's an internet forum after all not Ph.d thesis, regardless any of the problems if solved despite the horrible wording will signal an immense paradigma shift in AI or whatever it \"signals\" someone/some people will be doing something very right surpassing even Demis Hassabis, or even Einstein, Da Vinci, Tesla, Ada and the likes.<p>I'm curious what many people want to see from AI, since the IQ of this forum is high, I guess it won't be a beavis-and-butthead level of answers like \"photorealistic fps\" or \"teslas that sound like shelby\" or \"tastier burgers\", \"badass jetpacks\" , \"fully immersive VR where you can interview andrew tate\", \"cabrio boeing\", etc etc.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",
