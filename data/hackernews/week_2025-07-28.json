          "text": "I built https://www.stoodious.app for my wife while she was studying for her California Real Estate Broker's Exam. She was frustrated with the price gouging on text books, or being the \"state-of-the-art\" study platforms being video only, having no/poor mobile UX or just feeling outright dated. So I built Stoodious as a study guide platform that intends to give you the material and get out of your way, as opposed to the engagement-driving gamification of others. One of the killer features is being able to drill practice questions related to the specific study section you're working on - e.g. 20-30 questions about water rights, encumbrances or calculating GRM. Frequently my wife found herself studying vocab for a section but having to skim through a 100-question practice test to find related questions. I extended the material to all 50 states' basic real estate licensing exam and am looking to add even more \"professional exam\" material. reply",

          "text": "My roommate and I are still working on Tornyol, our mosquito killing drone! It uses ultrasonic sonar to detect mosquitoes, and missile control theory to ram into mosquitoes and grind them in its propellers. Our target platform is a 40 grams tinywhoop so it’s safe to fly everywhere and makes almost no noise :). A Roomba for mosquitoes! The main plus compared to traditional systems is that a drone can cover an enormous surface in a short time compared to static systems or man-portable insecticide spraying. Our goal is to be competitive with ITNs against Malaria. Some links : https://hackaday.com/2025/03/25/supercon-2024-killing-mosqui... https://manifund.org/projects/build-anti-mosqu reply",

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

It does this by building a profile out of a small number of selected past articles, and we make the profile and how it produces recs from the profile transparent and editable.\nEspecially after feedback on HN ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44454305 ), Im trying to get to grips with why people seem to care as much about seeing how their recommendations work as they do about the actual quality of recommendations themselves. I'm increasingly convinced its due to how many opaque LLM-powered everything and black-box recommendation algorithms there are. People want personal content systems (they are useful for sure!), but theres a lack of ones where they stay in control of what 'personal' actually looks like. reply",

          "text": "Building TypeQuicker. Hoping to build the most advanced and data-driven, all-in-one typing platform. Practice typing code, natural text and much more! I have gone from 20ish WPM to 120WPM using my app over time and it completely changed my perspective on typing. Originally, I always thought typing wasn't important but my perspective changed when I had an internship and saw a co-worker being way more productive than me. It wasn't just because he typed faster, but because his typing speed enabled him to think faster and iterate quicker. I build this for myself initially just as a side project to learn certain tech stacks and kept iterating on it but it's really grown since and I've decided to release it. Right now we have the following features: - the most advanced stats than any other typing application (we analyze every millisecond of every character, bigram/trigram sequences, etc) - smart practice mode; we use detailed stats to build a weakness profile and use it to generate natural text for your practice based on those weakpoints. - target practice; using our detailed stats you can select certain sequences you wish to practice more and we generate natural text that contains those sequences. - you can practice typing code in any language/tool (have everything from Python to Bash to Nushell, etc) - custom practice; use your own texts / code snippets - create a custom color theme based on a picture of your keyboard (lot of keyboard enthusiast seem to have really liked this feature!) - no ads or trackers (hopefully forever). I hope to monetize this only via subscriptions (for high valuable features that I've built out) while keeping majority of the basic features completely free and accessible to everyone without ads or distractions. This is a passion project of mine and I hope to continue pushing to see just how good a typing application can get. Have many more features currently in progress.

The new code is at least twice as fast in benchmarks, but I can't run it in production because it turns out when you do it's four times as slow as what came before it for the queries that are the simplest and fastest to the point where queries exceed their timeout values by a lot. I'm 97% certain this is because the faster code leads to more page thrashing in the mmap-based index readers.

          "text": "I've built a VST3 plug-in that simulates a Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+ preamp purely from the circuit. The approach doesn't seem popular for professional plug-ins likely because it wasn't viable for real time until modern CPU enhancements became available. Performance scales with frequency of the input which is interesting and seems to be a consequence of using an iterative solver on a system of equations and using the previous sample's state vector as a guess for the current sample. On my MacBook M3 it requires between 50 to 70% of a single core to produce a 2x oversampled output at 48000Hz. This can be scaled back by reducing the solution tolerance bounds and get down near 25% with minimal quality loss. reply",

So I'm building this simulator which drops you into the operator’s seat. You can test out different scenarios and build an air defense network against various types of threats (stats from real world). Also have Ukraine, Israel-Iran scenarios. The new version is a lot more optimized, thanks in part to feedback from you all in HN. \nCurrently I am working on a new featureset with missions, where the user is given a budget and geographical area to defend by placing different air defense assets; after which the system attacks it with various missiles and UAVs.

I built it after my girlfriend had to manually classify 7,500 research papers. Cellm automates that kind of repetitive work. Since we added MCP and the use of structured output to \"spill\" multiple return values into adjecent cells, it is the quickest way I know of to monitor competitors blogs everyday before my 09:00 meeting. And also the quickest way I know of to test new AI models. I have a sheet with SimpleQA, MMLUPro, or GPQA Diamond and testing a new model is a matter of adding a new column.

Not to necessarily focus on the operating system used, but think of the attacker model and risk appetite of the organisation. What are the required integrity goals? What retention do you (legally) require? Who should be able to access those logs; on their own, or n-eye principle? Do such accesses need to be logged as well? What are the requirements from the users of the audit log? The things you'll need to log will become clear after answering such questions. How you structure them depends on the required access patterns. Tamper evidence can be achieved in many ways, but that depends on the integrity requirements; is an empty log line where one should have been enough \"tamper evident\"? Do you need some sort of verification mechanism that confirms the log lines you see were stored in that order? If your log only persists on the machine where it originated, does that satisfy integrity requirements? reply",

          "text": "I have worked in software dev for over 40 years with no degree at all. Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I came here to ask OP if they mean \"without STEM degree\", \"without STEM education\" ... Would physics degree (while STEM, it's supposedly not as close to Software/Tech as math or other types of engineering studies). Loads of such not strictly TECH folks end up in Big Tech as data scientists, as well as programmers. I only have ~25 years of \"work\" experience. I finished electrical engineering/electronics highschool (in parts of Europe you're 18 y/o by the time you finish highschool). And then just as I started with (computers focused) EE College - I also started freelancing. I started making websites/scripts/etc in the early 2000s. It turned into full time contracting, and then even moving countries for \"Software Engineering\" job - all before I finished college. Anyway - although in the last 2-5 years (Covid/Wars/etc) it became less common for companies to accept \"graduates\". My impression is that it's more about hiring freeze in general, than the more recent \"AI makes 100x developers possible\" hype. And by \"graduates\" I've seen both young folks with tech education but 0 work experience, as well as no (complete or at all official) tech education yet self taught and much more \"work experience\" from personal projects, competitions, hackathons. And of course there's also other tech stuff - UX/design, db/net/sys admins and such. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

Got my first computer (Commodore 128) soon after that, and started learning BASIC and 6502/Z80 assembly language. Got my first Internet account about 1993, and it came with a shell account, so I started learning Unix tools and a little C. In 1994-ish, a friend asked if I wanted to get in on a new ISP he was starting in my hometown, so I moved back and got a crash course in more Unix/Linux, networking, Perl, and more. Just been doing what comes along and learning enough to keep up ever since. reply",

Later on I got back into programming because of electronic juggling equipment. The pro stuff is so expensive despite being just LEDs with batteries and microcontrollers! So anyway I went down the path of learning embedded, making my own equipment including hardware. It turns out that compared to low level c++, programming for web isn't that different. In some ways it's easier. That's good because during COVID I had to take a break from live entertainment, and managed to make a living doing data science type web stuff (working for my sister, who finished her degree and had a research grant). Right now I'm back on the embedded scene but combining with web to make IoT juggling equipment (in partnership with a hardware company because I suck at hardware). Product coming soon! reply",

          "text": "Graduated with a B.A. in History from Cal in 2011. Struggled for 6+ months to land a job. Took any miscellaneous writing job on oDesk (now Upwork) that I could get. Saw a lot of contracts for something called \"technical writing\" and they often paid much better than other writing work. Figured out that it was basically \"instruction manuals for computer professionals\". Realized it was a good fit. Took a bunch of basic C.S. courses at community college. Family friend got my foot in the door at an IoT startup, but it was really those C.S. classes that persuaded them to give me a try. And the fact that I would work for peanuts. Turned out that I was competent in the work and I really enjoyed programming. A few years later, Google recruited me, and I've been at Google ever since. I technically have an A.S. in C.S. from that community college, but I think my circuitous path fits the \"non-traditional STEM background\" criteria. Computers have been great to me! Very thankful that I stumbled into this path. reply",

          "text": "My history is pretty wack. I have a graduate degree (MFA) in physical performance, and my work history until I was 40 was entirely in theatre: acting, writing, directing, and teaching. (And, you know, waiting tables, and selling shit, and all the other gig-work stuff actors have to do to get by). Thing is, I was always a tech nerd, too. I put up websites for every project I worked on - and plenty for friends, too - going back to the late nineties. I programmed (and sometimes physically repaired) lighting and sound systems. I built plug-ins for lighting and sound software, to solve problems various shows had. I set up networking stacks for a couple of theatres. In 2004 or so I built what was basically Brown Paper Tickets (before Brown Paper Tickets existed) for a theatre company I was working for at the time - backed by an Access database, of all things, running on an old box in the office because that's all we had to work with without paying for it. Later I built effectively MailChimp, to promote my own show. Arguably I should have monetized one or another of those tech projects, and done theatre later, but that was never the point. I enjoyed messing with tech, but didn't want to do any of it, except insofar as it made possible something else I really wanted to do. At 40 I lost my teaching job (enrollment dropped, and arts are always the first to go), and my wife and I didn't want to move, and were thinking of having a family, so I finally sold out. A restauranteur I'd worked a fair bit for in my twenties needed an IT Director for his growing company, and figured I could do it, which it turns out I can. I make three times what I did as a teacher, five or six times what I did in my best year as a working actor, and... Eh. I like my job. I'm pretty good at it, but it's what I'm doing in order to do what I really want to do, which these days is to support my family. I don't recommend my career path to anyone as a way into tech (lol!), and I think our world would be a better place if there were less money in tech, and more in arts and education. reply",

While it was always possible for me to find work before the degree, I have to admit that the work offered was vastly incommensurate with both my actual skill level and my desired compensation. This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch. I do think this effect would have faded out gradually either way, markets are going to reach equilibrium. But the degree made it happen much faster for me even despite relocating to an entirely foreign job market. I would say get the degree in almost all cases. reply",

In fact, apart from Elon Musk, I am at pains to find anyone influential who has a degree. Some may insist that a degree is more common than this narrative suggests, but granted that, it seems there is a weak to nonexistent correlation between technical career success and an advanced degree. Young people should learn this, before preparing for a career that might not rely on the degree. Or before signing up for a course of instruction that teaches skills no longer in demand -- like computer programming. reply",

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

The trick is to minimize your surfaces as much as possible: - Only keep open ports/forward ports for applications you use, drop/block everything else. - Use strict host-header checking for web services on port 80/443, drop anything to 403/404 that doesn't have a valid host-header for the website(s) you're hosting. - Move SSH and other remote admin servers to use a non-standard port. (legit, find a random port number between 9000-65535) - If it doesn't need to be public, allow-list it with iptables. Unfortunately DO and other providers will never have 100% legit traffic, it's just the nature of the Internet's noise floor. Hope this helps you or someone else! reply",

No. And this comes from someone that uses it as I'm a developer. You might want a high level understanding of what tool-use is and what different LLMs are capable of doing. If you find LLMs useful then you might even want to equip Claude desktop with some tools that have been created for everyone to use. For your perspective: MCP enables tool-use. Well, there are other ways, but MCP standardizes it. > Do I need to start creating apps and sites using Vibe coding (I’m not a developer)? At best, vibe coded apps allow you to create high fidelity prototypes, which is amazing but you can't create a fully functional product with just vibe coding. There may be the odd exception that made it work, but I suspect that would take a lot of effort with the current state of the art. I'd recommend lovable.dev if you want to create a prototype. reply",

I applied this methodology to mobile, cryptocurrencies, Web3, VR, and AI. I ended up being bearish about cryptocurrencies and Web3 and bullish about mobile, VR and AI. VR is having a fair amount of trouble taking off, but I think AI is not facing the same challenges. As such, I'm betting very strongly that it's going to be part of our future, and that means now is a good time to start understanding how it works and what people are saying about it and what might come next. I do this by putting my hands on the technology and running lots of different models locally and also experimenting with cloud models, as well as exploring what tools companies are building with these technologies. Simply reading doesn't quite do it for me. I don't do this because I'm worried about being left behind, nearly as much as I want to be able to deploy these tools effectively in the future to solve problems. It's also fun! reply",

          "text": "Depends on what your goal is. Every few months LLM's get markedly better. In days GPT-5 will come out which by early reports (and anecdotal evidence on LMarena) is substantively better than the best current coding models. Will it surpass humans? It is a possibility, unless there is some yet unforeseen impassable intelligence gap below human intelligence and above SOTA AI intelligence. Coding as a hobby seems to be more fun for people without AI tools. You get the experience of more completely holding the system in your head, your interaction with the codebase is more intuitive and connected deeply to your natural reasoning faculties. However, I believe the purism of eschewing AI tools is a trap that had few consequences in 2023, or even 2024, but by the end of 2025, the standard for what a \"productive software developer\" can accomplish in a week will be set by the boon AI tools give to mid and senior developers. That's it, there's no getting around the reality of technological progress. Soon after that, there will be few if any humans in the loop at all for all except the highest level executive decisions. Coding will be an artisan task done for personal enjoyment, like knitting or cooking. reply",

My non-devwloper friends (we're in our 40s) are using it to improve their productivity. They have already realized that the AI is bad at some tasks but great at others. For example, a person in PR now no longer writes the 'day to day' PR releases. It's a complete waste of their time, they're really just a formality anyway, and an AI can do it. But they still do all the important ones. It can release you from routine tasks, or make them trivial. I've also heard of someone who's using it to find jobs to tender for that they previously didn't have time to figure out. Filter + summarize. So tasks and opportunities that were too time consuming are now viable. People are making their own mini apps for personal use that are specific for their field. You don't necessarily have to have the ideas, but you do need to talk to people in your field and find out what they're doing. MCP/Agents/etc. are pretty cutting edge, but you will start hearing non-techies using them soon. Agents/MCP means the LLM can do things. You can ask it to make a plan of action, and then DO the actions. It's still a bit ropey. But soon you might be able to ask your AI to go into HubSpot, find 10 leads that look like they've gone stale and send them a special offer.

          "text": "Your first question conflicts with your goal or earning enough for living expenses. Software that supports a lifestyle business is typically different than YC scale or ideas accepted by YC. If your goal is to build a lifestyle business that affords a salary of ~$100K, you likely don't need to scale beyond $1M in revenue. You would actively want to avoid raising money (from YC or other investors) because their goals are to get companies to $100M+. That isn't a bad thing — it actually opens up the door to a much wider range of problems & niches, with more flexibility & less pressure. 1. Given the above, scrap the YC aspect of the question. But ideas can come from your own experiences with problems or pain points you felt. Or can pick an industry or role and have conversations with people to find common issues or challenges. 2 & 3. This depends on the vertical & industry you serve + their role. If you're selling to VP of sales of startups, can get by with emailing + LinkedIn. If you're selling to local professional services, can get by with cold calling. Where you build your list will depend on your target. reply",

And the most important part of marketing was finding (and validating) a painful problem businesses would pay for. - It is important to talk directly with real prospects: real business owners. You can use stuff like Gartner reports to help find a niche, but it is essential to talk directly with real people who have the problem. - Validation involved getting a prepayment even though the software did not exist. Not even a design. Prepayment got the initial 10 or so \"champions\" a lifetime discount and personal input into how the app would be developed. - The prepayments served as a much stronger validation than a verbal \"yes.\" Also it funded development of the initial version. The 10 champions' input also made the initial version much better. - Generally, a \"painful\" problem will result in at least a 10X ROI (additional revenue, saved expenses, saved time, etc). If you describe the painful problem better than the prospects themselves can, they will assume you have the solution and jump straight to \"how do I pay you? (sign up)\" - The market research math is roughly: find a niche with at least 10,000 prospects. Plan to capture 1% of this market, or 100 customers. If you can find a painful problem whose solution is worth paying $100-200/month, you should be able to achieve $80K profit/year. (The Paperless Pipeline origin story is slightly different. For example, there was really only a single true \"champion.\" But this champion was the happy customer of another SaaS that was built with the same process. This champion kept asking for this other SaaS that turned into PaperlessPipeline.) --- So I think the resources below provide the most risk-free (highest chance of success) way of achieving your goal (I think YC targets \"unicorns\" with much higher potential ROI with the understanding at least 90% will fail): - The founder of Paperless Pipeline has been teaching his method: https://startfromzero.com (Specifically \"Idea Extraction\" is the most important part) - Apparently he is going to start a YouTube channel where he teaches his stuff for free. - https://30x500.com is another great course that teaches a similar method, and more geared toward engineer-types. - https://shop.stackingthebricks.com : Kind of like the a-la-carte version of the 30x500. The two most valuable parts are probably \"Sales Safari\" and \"Just F*ckin Ship.\" reply",

          "text": "Just like any tool, the use case varies. If you are playing around locally, and or uploading to open source like github or pypi, then its fine to use. For production code that is critical,  the entire \"build\" process needs to be pure local processing/copy - i.e nothing downloaded from the internet, anything that is compiled needs to be done with local tools that are already installed. I.e for python project deployments, the right way of doing this with containers for is to build a core image where you do run all the install commands that download stuff from the internet, and the actual production build dockerfile involves only copying files to the library locations, and the final run command. You don't need to \"build\" packages with anything (unless of course your package contains C dependencies, which is a whole nother can of worms). I think the desire for something like UV comes from the fact that people just don't think about what is going under the hood. Its somewhat understandable if you are a data scientist that just uses python for math, but for people in computer science/engineering, they really should be able to use python as is without any external tools. reply",

A lot of people are calling for Python to just bless the tool officially, distribute it with Python etc. (which is a little strange to me given that it's also promoted as a way to get Python!) — the way people talk about uv, makes it seem hard to get people to care even if that did happen. Regardless, I feel strongly that everyone who cares about distributing their code and participating in the ecosystem should take the time to understand the underlying infrastructure of venvs, wheels/sdists, etc. A big part of what uv has accomplished for Python is rapidly implementing new standards like PEP 723 and PEP 751 — rather, they were AFAICT well underway on the implementations while the standards were being finalized, and the Astral team have also been important figures in the discussion. Those standards will persist no matter what Astral decides to do as a company. And for what it's worth, pip actually is slowly, inexorably improving. It just isn't currently in a position to make a clean break from many of the things holding it back. > What's your approach here? Are you building abstraction layers? The opposite: I'm sticking with more focused tools (including the ones I'm making myself) and the UNIX philosophy. PAPER is scoped to implement a lot of useful tools for managing packages and environments, but it's still low-level (and unlike pip, I'm starting with an explicit API). It won't manage a project for you, won't install Python, will have no [tool] config in pyproject.toml... it's really intended as a user tool, with overlapping uses for developers. On the other side, bbbb is meant to hook everything up so that you can run a build step (unlike Flit, commonly suggested as the simplest option), choose which files are in the distribution, have all the wheel book-keeping taken care of... but things like locating or invoking a compiler are out of scope. A full dev toolchain would include both, plus some kind of Make-like system (I have a vague design for one), a build front-end (`build` works fine except that it's hard-coded to use either pip or uv to make environments, so I might make a separate PAPER plugin...), an uploader (`twine` is fine, really!) and probably your own additional scripts according to personal preference. reply",

Pip gained a correct (relative to the standards and metadata availability of the time) resolving algorithm in 2020 or soon thereafter. uv adds performance largely via heuristics and shortcuts (i.e., given multiple options for trying to fix a problem, it tries to try them in an order that's more likely to find a solution earlier). This stuff seems like the hard part and I'm probably doing to just drop in pip's logic (which has already been isolated as `resolvelib`, though it requires some interfacing) at least to start. > uv's answer to be not written in Python was genius, not least because it contributes to speed (caching matters a lot, a pure-Python system could dot that) but because a static linked binary completely eliminates the dangers of corrupted environments. (poetry gets fubared if you use it long enough) All you needed to do was make your tool have its own isolated environment (in an out-of-the-way place), have it function cross-environment (pip now accomplishes this by a \"re-run the code\" hack; PAPER has logic to just inspect the target environment explicitly) and refuse to install anything in the tool's environment that isn't vetted as necessary for a tool plugin etc. Yes, I'm sure data scientists can screw up environments something fierce. That's why you let them have their own playground. My plan is to also create a default \"sandbox\" environment (like what pip originally tried to do with `--user`, except actually a virtual environment and not given special path-hack treatment) for \"library\" installs when no target is explicitly specified, and do all \"application\" installs in new environments by default. I don't know what issues you encountered with Poetry. If they're still a thing in 2.x (apparently they're at 2.1.3 now), I'm sure they'd appreciate a reproducer. > I didn't got forward with it because when I asked around I found Pythoners just didn't give a damn that the pip resolver didn't really work -- it works for them, if their project is simple. Pip does work for a lot of people (although it's slow even when it does literally nothing), which is a big part of why it didn't face a lot of pressure to improve. Circa 2017, the complaints were more nebulous, and probably a bigger share of them could be attributed to poor ecosystem standards (in particular, metadata availability) and to Setuptools.

That branching tree approach you mentioned — composing prompt→prompt→query in a structured cascade — is underrated genius.\nWe ended up building something similar, but layered a semantic engine on top to decide which prompt chain deserves to exist in that moment, not just statically prewiring them.

In our system:\n- Contributions are always recorded — not ignored.\n- Every action builds \"prestige\", a cumulative trust score.\n- Governance rights (like proposing or deciding future work) are based only on contribution history — not status or popularity.\n- And crucially, governance cannot be used to exclude others. It is designed solely to guide future contributions, not suppress participation. So even if someone has more authority, it’s only to help steer future work — never to silence or reject others. We’re trying to build a structure where trust grows from contribution, not control. If you’re willing —  \nwhat part of your experience felt most unfair?  \nAnd what hurt you the most?

When this system breaks down, the value of the system as a form of certification drops. But the problem with many of these systems is they might be too democratic. Discourse, by the same creators as SO, also breaks from the very same problem - someone who is not part of the community suddenly becomes the community despot. The structure sounds similar to what you propose; anyone who makes contributions can govern. I think you have to think through how scoring is done and managed. There are systems that work, like the Nobel Prize and Academy Awards, but those only work to recognize top people, not large groups of people. reply",

          "text": "I have built bunch of MCP servers so far, and here is my take (and why I love it) There are 2 types of actions, (1) read-only and (2) MCP servers/tools with side effects 1. Read-only types. As you know, LLMs are static models, they don't learn things between your sessions, hence you need RAG or better prompting to enrich the context to get the best results for your use case. MCP helps you with enriching that context. For example, you want to categorize your recent emails, you can obviously copy paste all of them as a context, then ask LLM to categorize. Or you use MCP server to pull emails and add it to the context. This is very similar to RAG, but heavily personalized for your use case (e.g. by pulling data from Jira, Github only when you ask it) 2. MCPs with side effects (write/delete) - Here you can leverage NLP capabilities of MCP to take actions. For example, send email or create an event in your calendar, or enrich the contents of Jira ticket. Same as (1), you can ask LLM to come up with contents and then manually copy/paste it to your calendar to create an event or leverage the convenience of MCP tools to do it automatically. Here are some demos from my MCP servers: * Integration with Google Calendar to create events based on information of another MCP server (memory) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgEy6Y1kfn4 * Here you can see how easily you can integrate your OpenAPI based spec and use human language to query it - https://x.com/getaikoapp/status/1945278307496235482 reply",

Or while working on a feature, I can ask it to delete all the test records I created, etc. I can do that in a repl myself, but it’s sometimes a nice shortcut. Note, this only runs in dev, so it’s not querying my production database or anything. Basically, they can be a way to expose additional data or tools to the LLM. reply",

          "text": "This is an issue with the prompt and/or the tool descriptions and/or the model. A MCP server is really just a collection of functions the model can call, and a list of those functions and their description/input params. In theory the MCP connector is calling /get-tools on the MCP servers and injecting that into the prompt, so the model knows which tools are available, their description and input params.  It's then up to the model to pick a specific tool to use. I don't know where specifically the MCP tools are injected into the prompt or what the original system prompt is (ie: maybe it's saying \"always give the internal tools priority and only use MCPs if nothing else fits\"). It could be the MCP server has poor descriptions of the tool.  That is what the model uses to decide to use it or not. It could also be the model just sucks.  Claude Opus/Sonnet seem to be some of the best at tool calling, but it's still up to the model to pick which tools to use.  Some models are better than other. Some models start to regress in their tool calling abilities as the context window fills up. My instinct is the MCP tools have bad descriptions.  I've done a bit of reverse engineering of Claude Code and most of the tool descriptions are very detailed.  \"Use this tool to call a bash command\" would be a bad tool description.  The Claude Code bash tool description is 110 lines long containing detailed usage information, when to use it, when not to use it, example usage and etc. It also has a summary at the bottom of very important things (that were just written above in the same description) for the model not to forget (they use the word IMPORTANT and YOU MUST a lot in the prompts/descriptions) reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple RAG pipelines across Windsurf, Claude, and even Gemini-Codex hybrids, and I’ve learned this: Most of the current devtools are competing at the UX/UI layer — not the semantic inference layer. Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

          "text": "If mathematical definitions, theorems and proofs help your way of thinking, then go for it. Many good people don't even need math books to be really effective with data structures. High-performance data structures are more about different Geometries (asymmetries in timings on hardware vs. access patterns -- tape vs. drum (bubble-sort, yay) vs. disk vs. flash; temporal locality, spatial locality, caching) rather than algebraic structures (symmetry properties of binary trees, bipartite graphs, groups, rings, fields, algebras, set algebras). Some people interested in discrete mathematics and data structures go with Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming.  Knuth mentioned the link between drum storage and bubble sort.  Just a fun tidbit. Stuff like permutations become interesting for statistics and NP-hard search problems. P.S. What options do you have to clarify your question?  How is learning discrete mathematics from Keneth Rosen's books linked to hard requirements for understanding data structures and at the same time learning discrete mathematics step by step?  Which are you targeting, data structures or discrete mathematics? reply",

I was looking at some stuff that seemed to indicate to me that the OSA could make it difficult to self host Mastodon without providing age verification. I was then reading the provisions and realsised that it didn't really affect you unless you have at least 3 million monthly users, so in theory would not affect self hosters with only a few users. But then I thought that if you are federated with a very large instance then your users could potentially be able to interact with enough users to fall under the provisions.<p>This could potentially be a grey area that could expose self hosters to considerable risk if they are not careful.<p>I wonder if there any UK based Mastodon hosters out there who are considering this. Are you considering shutting down to prevent any liability? Could this be the \"death\" of Mastodon hosting in the UK?</p></p></div>",

If you have an instance and are below the 3m MAUs, you're likely fine. Until you're not. The moment a Mastodon instance is found to be hosting content the OSA is meant to protect minors from, that instance will be investigated and explored to the most liberal interpretation of the law, and that individual is going to find themselves either implementing age verification, shutting down that instance, or fighting their stance in court. Risk, as ever, is about likelihood, not just impact. How likely are you to find yourself hosting such content? Could you self host just for you and people known to you? Your question implies you want to set up a centralised instance with lots of people you don't know, but that's the exact scenario Mastodon is meant to counter, it's meant to be federated. And if it's just you and your mates, what's the issue? If you want to give children access, you're into another World of problems, so maybe for your own sanity - and arguably, theirs - just don't do that. reply",

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree.

          "text": "I have worked in software dev for over 40 years with no degree at all. Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I came here to ask OP if they mean \"without STEM degree\", \"without STEM education\" ... Would physics degree (while STEM, it's supposedly not as close to Software/Tech as math or other types of engineering studies). Loads of such not strictly TECH folks end up in Big Tech as data scientists, as well as programmers. I only have ~25 years of \"work\" experience. I finished electrical engineering/electronics highschool (in parts of Europe you're 18 y/o by the time you finish highschool). And then just as I started with (computers focused) EE College - I also started freelancing. I started making websites/scripts/etc in the early 2000s. It turned into full time contracting, and then even moving countries for \"Software Engineering\" job - all before I finished college. Anyway - although in the last 2-5 years (Covid/Wars/etc) it became less common for companies to accept \"graduates\". My impression is that it's more about hiring freeze in general, than the more recent \"AI makes 100x developers possible\" hype. And by \"graduates\" I've seen both young folks with tech education but 0 work experience, as well as no (complete or at all official) tech education yet self taught and much more \"work experience\" from personal projects, competitions, hackathons. And of course there's also other tech stuff - UX/design, db/net/sys admins and such. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

Saw a lot of contracts for something called \"technical writing\" and they often paid much better than other writing work. Figured out that it was basically \"instruction manuals for computer professionals\". Realized it was a good fit. Took a bunch of basic C.S. courses at community college. Family friend got my foot in the door at an IoT startup, but it was really those C.S. classes that persuaded them to give me a try. And the fact that I would work for peanuts. Turned out that I was competent in the work and I really enjoyed programming. A few years later, Google recruited me, and I've been at Google ever since. I technically have an A.S. in C.S. from that community college, but I think my circuitous path fits the \"non-traditional STEM background\" criteria. Computers have been great to me!

This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch.

I have a graduate degree (MFA) in physical performance, and my work history until I was 40 was entirely in theatre: acting, writing, directing, and teaching. (And, you know, waiting tables, and selling shit, and all the other gig-work stuff actors have to do to get by). Thing is, I was always a tech nerd, too. I put up websites for every project I worked on - and plenty for friends, too - going back to the late nineties. I programmed (and sometimes physically repaired) lighting and sound systems. I built plug-ins for lighting and sound software, to solve problems various shows had. I set up networking stacks for a couple of theatres. In 2004 or so I built what was basically Brown Paper Tickets (before Brown Paper Tickets existed) for a theatre company I was working for at the time - backed by an Access database, of all things, running on an old box in the office because that's all we had to work with without paying for it. Later I built effectively MailChimp, to promote my own show. Arguably I should have monetized one or another of those tech projects, and done theatre later, but that was never the point. I enjoyed messing with tech, but didn't want to do any of it, except insofar as it made possible something else I really wanted to do. At 40 I lost my teaching job (enrollment dropped, and arts are always the first to go), and my wife and I didn't want to move, and were thinking of having a family, so I finally sold out. A restauranteur I'd worked a fair bit for in my twenties needed an IT Director for his growing company, and figured I could do it, which it turns out I can. I make three times what I did as a teacher, five or six times what I did in my best year as a working actor, and... Eh. I like my job. I'm pretty good at it, but it's what I'm doing in order to do what I really want to do, which these days is to support my family. I don't recommend my career path to anyone as a way into tech (lol!), and I think our world would be a better place if there were less money in tech, and more in arts and education. reply",

In fact, apart from Elon Musk, I am at pains to find anyone influential who has a degree. Some may insist that a degree is more common than this narrative suggests, but granted that, it seems there is a weak to nonexistent correlation between technical career success and an advanced degree.

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

The perspective change happened when I realized giving it an entire problem and expecting it to solve that is unrealistic. The real value add is if you can use AI at the right steps of your workflow or larger system. I did a PhD in program synthesis (programming languages techniques) and one the tricks there was to efficiently prune the space of programs. With LLMs it is more much more likely to start with an almost correct guess, the burden now shifts to lighter verification methods. I still do not believe in the AGI hype. But I am genuinely excited. Computing has always been humans writing precise algorithms and getting correct answers. The current generation of LLMs are the opposite you can be imprecise, but the answers can be wrong. We have to figure out what interesting systems we can build with it. reply",

Not to necessarily focus on the operating system used, but think of the attacker model and risk appetite of the organisation. What are the required integrity goals? What retention do you (legally) require? Who should be able to access those logs; on their own, or n-eye principle? Do such accesses need to be logged as well? What are the requirements from the users of the audit log? The things you'll need to log will become clear after answering such questions. How you structure them depends on the required access patterns. Tamper evidence can be achieved in many ways, but that depends on the integrity requirements; is an empty log line where one should have been enough \"tamper evident\"? Do you need some sort of verification mechanism that confirms the log lines you see were stored in that order? If your log only persists on the machine where it originated, does that satisfy integrity requirements? reply",

The trick is to minimize your surfaces as much as possible: - Only keep open ports/forward ports for applications you use, drop/block everything else. - Use strict host-header checking for web services on port 80/443, drop anything to 403/404 that doesn't have a valid host-header for the website(s) you're hosting. - Move SSH and other remote admin servers to use a non-standard port. (legit, find a random port number between 9000-65535) - If it doesn't need to be public, allow-list it with iptables. Unfortunately DO and other providers will never have 100% legit traffic, it's just the nature of the Internet's noise floor. Hope this helps you or someone else! reply",

VR is having a fair amount of trouble taking off, but I think AI is not facing the same challenges. As such, I'm betting very strongly that it's going to be part of our future, and that means now is a good time to start understanding how it works and what people are saying about it and what might come next. I do this by putting my hands on the technology and running lots of different models locally and also experimenting with cloud models, as well as exploring what tools companies are building with these technologies. Simply reading doesn't quite do it for me. I don't do this because I'm worried about being left behind, nearly as much as I want to be able to deploy these tools effectively in the future to solve problems. It's also fun! reply",

Getting a feel for what LLM's can and can't do is also proving to be an interesting and fun exercise for me.  I use them daily, but haven't committed a line of code written by one.  I suspect that will always be the case, but nonetheless not using them would be a career limiting move. I suspect that's because an LLM is just a specialised AI that's not good for much beyond understanding the written language and regurgitating what they've seen before.  (That almost sounds flippant, given how much in awe I am at both their language abilities and how much they remember.)  There are lots of other AI's out there.  They play chess and go, do protein folding, predict weather and I'm sure a plethora of other things I don't know about.  They are all universally better at their respective tasks than humans (and that includes LLM's ability to process language.)  I can't shake the feeling that one day, someone will create one that can do more than spit out code similar to what it's seen before. reply",

In days GPT-5 will come out which by early reports (and anecdotal evidence on LMarena) is substantively better than the best current coding models. Will it surpass humans? It is a possibility, unless there is some yet unforeseen impassable intelligence gap below human intelligence and above SOTA AI intelligence. Coding as a hobby seems to be more fun for people without AI tools. You get the experience of more completely holding the system in your head, your interaction with the codebase is more intuitive and connected deeply to your natural reasoning faculties. However, I believe the purism of eschewing AI tools is a trap that had few consequences in 2023, or even 2024, but by the end of 2025, the standard for what a \"productive software developer\" can accomplish in a week will be set by the boon AI tools give to mid and senior developers. That's it, there's no getting around the reality of technological progress. Soon after that, there will be few if any humans in the loop at all for all except the highest level executive decisions.

The first time I actually got something from a MCP was when I just asked claude to check my emails for anything I need to act on. I had 8 emails in the inbox, didn't expect it to find anything. But it found an important request from accounting that was cc-ed and forwarded multiple times to the point I didn't see the actual ask. It was also some tedious bureaucratic stuff so Claude write the response to it in 2 minutes and I didn't have to procrastinate on it the whole morning. reply",

I use LLMs every day for random stuff, but not really because I need the output, more because I need to know and understand where it's strengths and weaknesses are. You're not trying to become an overnight expert here. Nobody expects that. But there's this gap right now between what stakeholders think AI can do (basically everything) and what it actually can do. And guess who needs to bridge that gap? As a software engineer part of your responsibility is to advise non-software engineers on what is just now possible with technology, because when a stakeholder comes to you with some wacky idea, you need to be able to judge it and decide on the investment of time the idea might require, or if it's even possible today/now. reply",

          "text": "Yes, you should. As you're not a developer, but haven't told us your field, here are some general reasons why. My non-devwloper friends (we're in our 40s) are using it to improve their productivity. They have already realized that the AI is bad at some tasks but great at others. For example, a person in PR now no longer writes the 'day to day' PR releases. It's a complete waste of their time, they're really just a formality anyway, and an AI can do it. But they still do all the important ones. It can release you from routine tasks, or make them trivial. I've also heard of someone who's using it to find jobs to tender for that they previously didn't have time to figure out. Filter + summarize. So tasks and opportunities that were too time consuming are now viable. People are making their own mini apps for personal use that are specific for their field. You don't necessarily have to have the ideas, but you do need to talk to people in your field and find out what they're doing. MCP/Agents/etc. are pretty cutting edge, but you will start hearing non-techies using them soon. Agents/MCP means the LLM can do things. You can ask it to make a plan of action, and then DO the actions. It's still a bit ropey. But soon you might be able to ask your AI to go into HubSpot, find 10 leads that look like they've gone stale and send them a special offer. (It's not quite there yet, and a bit unreliable on something as high level as that, code is less fuzzy and so it performs better). reply",

          "text": "Your first question conflicts with your goal or earning enough for living expenses. Software that supports a lifestyle business is typically different than YC scale or ideas accepted by YC. If your goal is to build a lifestyle business that affords a salary of ~$100K, you likely don't need to scale beyond $1M in revenue. You would actively want to avoid raising money (from YC or other investors) because their goals are to get companies to $100M+. That isn't a bad thing — it actually opens up the door to a much wider range of problems & niches, with more flexibility & less pressure. 1. Given the above, scrap the YC aspect of the question. But ideas can come from your own experiences with problems or pain points you felt. Or can pick an industry or role and have conversations with people to find common issues or challenges. 2 & 3. This depends on the vertical & industry you serve + their role. If you're selling to VP of sales of startups, can get by with emailing + LinkedIn. If you're selling to local professional services, can get by with cold calling. Where you build your list will depend on your target. reply",

          "text": "This successful B2B SaaS was (originally) developed by a single person who didn't know how to code (without any investors): https://www.paperlesspipeline.com The key insight was: marketing was the most important part. And the most important part of marketing was finding (and validating) a painful problem businesses would pay for. - It is important to talk directly with real prospects: real business owners. You can use stuff like Gartner reports to help find a niche, but it is essential to talk directly with real people who have the problem. - Validation involved getting a prepayment even though the software did not exist. Not even a design. Prepayment got the initial 10 or so \"champions\" a lifetime discount and personal input into how the app would be developed. - The prepayments served as a much stronger validation than a verbal \"yes.\" Also it funded development of the initial version. The 10 champions' input also made the initial version much better. - Generally, a \"painful\" problem will result in at least a 10X ROI (additional revenue, saved expenses, saved time, etc). If you describe the painful problem better than the prospects themselves can, they will assume you have the solution and jump straight to \"how do I pay you? (sign up)\" - The market research math is roughly: find a niche with at least 10,000 prospects. Plan to capture 1% of this market, or 100 customers. If you can find a painful problem whose solution is worth paying $100-200/month, you should be able to achieve $80K profit/year. (The Paperless Pipeline origin story is slightly different. For example, there was really only a single true \"champion.\" But this champion was the happy customer of another SaaS that was built with the same process. This champion kept asking for this other SaaS that turned into PaperlessPipeline.) --- So I think the resources below provide the most risk-free (highest chance of success) way of achieving your goal (I think YC targets \"unicorns\" with much higher potential ROI with the understanding at least 90% will fail): - The founder of Paperless Pipeline has been teaching his method: https://startfromzero.com (Specifically \"Idea Extraction\" is the most important part) - Apparently he is going to start a YouTube channel where he teaches his stuff for free. - https://30x500.com is another great course that teaches a similar method, and more geared toward engineer-types. - https://shop.stackingthebricks.com : Kind of like the a-la-carte version of the 30x500. The two most valuable parts are probably \"Sales Safari\" and \"Just F*ckin Ship.\" reply",

So many threads used to be essentially Cursor vs Windsurf, Cursor alone as a presumed champion, and more recently Claude Code.<p>Basically never hear about Augment Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, etc. which all seem pretty well respected. Or Replit, Bolt which seem to have huge user numbers (not professional devs though which is why I assume they're so under-represented here).</p></div>",

Claude Code grabbed tons of attention because it uses the command line and enables developers to boost their productivity. Because it works via the command line, it doesn’t require using an editor/IDE you may not use, and it’s extensible via custom slash commands and hooks. It’s only been out a few months and there’s already a cottage industry of websites, tutorials and videos supporting it. It’s not perfect but it’s really good in ways that matter to developers. I’ve never seen so many developers making videos and blogposts describing how happy they are to pay $200/month for the Max plan due to the productivity gains. reply",

Codex CLI just feels like a stripped-down version of Claude Code. Claude Code wins for me for one simple reason: I can just pay for a MAX account and not worry about running out of credits or going through my credit card limit. That makes me use the tool twice as much as the others, where I’m constantly watching my credit balance. Cursor wins because it was the first big one, not sure if it has any important advantages over claude code anymore. reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple RAG pipelines across Windsurf, Claude, and even Gemini-Codex hybrids, and I’ve learned this: Most of the current devtools are competing at the UX/UI layer — not the semantic inference layer. Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

One friend, who did his university studies in Europe, responded with: \n\"A friend of a friend is doing a computer science bachelor's. Same place I did mine. But the easier version. And he doesn't know anything, everybody just cheats on everything.\"<p>Of course, this is anecdata. But I've never heard him be so strongly opinionated about university.<p>So I'm simply asking the question to see if there's nuance to this discussion or whether this is becoming the new normal rapidly. Or perhaps I'm just in a bubble.<p>I'm open to your experiences about this and what you all know.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

That studying for 4 years does not give you that skill? Because it probably does. That doesn't make them better than people who didn't do that study, it just is a different experience. And if they abused AI in the process, there will be better and worse students from any given cohort.... but that was true before AI as well. There have always been people who deeply engaged with their education, alongside people who skated by just barely doing enough work to graduate. reply",

They undervalued it in terms of the technical skills I've learned simply because they projected their educational experiences onto mine. That's what that it is. But apparently _now_ it seems we're going to a world where hiring managers don't believe _anyone_ to have those skills, even if they in fact do have it. I guess new grads have to make a portfolio on the side and take care of the code quality. Because even if you vibe coded that application, vibe coding a project with high code quality still shows a strong skill in programming as LLMs aren't there yet to do that fully themselves? Like, how are skillful new grads supposed to show their skill when everyone (is about to) believe their education doesn't show any evidence of skill? And yea, I agree, cheaters will be cheaters.

          "text": "Overall, I think it's still credible, but less credible than before, and heavily depends on your situation. I run a program for students as a replacement for university, so I'm a bit biased when it comes to this discussion. It's useful to analyze both what a student want out of a degree and how a degree is \"consumed\" by another party (ex. an employer). 1. University degrees are still the \"gold standard\" in socially accepted proof-of-education. I think this is mostly due to social momentum. A few years of a \"bad batch\", ex. due to rampant cheating etc, will not change this. When I talk to other hiring managers, it's a bit of mixed bag. Some sorta understand where the students are coming from, as they also think that a lot of courses etc are arbitrary. Others are more concerned about the ethics of cheating, and the implications on a student's character, rather than the education outcomes (\"I can work with inexperience, I can't tolerate lying\"). 2. If you're planning to pursue a heavily regulated profession, like medicine, you most likely need a degree. 3. As others pointed out, the university criteria now more closely resembles a toll someone must pay to access higher-paying jobs. Ie. it's less about education than gatekeeping. Having it doesn't make you qualified. Not having it disqualifies you in many people's eyes. I think this is partially driving a lot of the cheating. Students sense the disconnect from the university program (and schooling in general) vs real skills. It's just another hoop they have to jump through so they will choose the path of least resistance. For many parents, it's a sort of capstone project for a parenting job well-done. And that adds more to the complexity. 4. How you take advantage of your university experience matters. I wouldn't count on the university for a durable education, ie. actually teaching you things that will make you successful. You need to get that elsewhere (thus the emphasis on work experience). But the social momentum is important, as universities are social centers for young adults, so you may get socially isolated if you don't go. In this case, the value is in the network, not so much the programs etc. The university experience, despite it's flaws, is still the status quo and definitely the safer \"bet\". Unless a person have clear understanding of why they shouldn't go, they should probably still go. reply",

          "text": "In some ways, it's not better. I agree that the shift is now going towards more real-world experience rather than academics. Part of the motivation for me to create the program was to introduce more self-direction and real-world problems[1]. In addition, I think it's useful to separate education from schooling. What we often confound is the actual acquisition of useful knowledge (fundamental meaning of education) and our institutions (education systems). Learning on your own is very much education! However, I think employment etc are more complex than just education. There are other factors, like social acceptability, political risk, etc. I've talked to managers who are just risk-averse when it comes to non-degreed students. They'll privately accept that this person has all the skills, maybe even more so than other candidates, but they can't accept them because if this candidate messes up, they will get blamed for hiring them. The political risk is too much, and would be much less if the candidate has more degrees. The systems of accountability is messed up but that's the reality young people have to navigate. They have to understand the markedness of not having a degree. It's sorta like the social version of \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" Depending on what they want to do, the degree won't matter. If you start your own company, obviously no one will care if you have a degree. Some investors see it as a plus. You can argue that putting a 4-yr university tuition as startup capital will teach more useful skills than a degree, even if they don't pursue entrepreneurship later. But most people are not willing or can't take those risks. [1] https://www.divepod.to reply",

It uses ultrasonic sonar to detect mosquitoes, and missile control theory to ram into mosquitoes and grind them in its propellers. Our target platform is a 40 grams tinywhoop so it’s safe to fly everywhere and makes almost no noise :). A Roomba for mosquitoes! The main plus compared to traditional systems is that a drone can cover an enormous surface in a short time compared to static systems or man-portable insecticide spraying.

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

          "text": "So cool! So, I buy this brand of thin-sole shoes called Xero. Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

You don't have to make all design decisions beforehand, but can wear something for a while and then make changes based on your needs & observations. I haven't quite figured out how to apply this thinking to seam sealing though. The current garments that have taped / waterproof seams are locked into the taped configuration. For tents I have some geometrically water repellent structures (that guide the water away as long as it's coming from above), but for the soles of footwear, you might want something 100% sealed. reply",

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

I built it after my girlfriend had to manually classify 7,500 research papers. Cellm automates that kind of repetitive work. Since we added MCP and the use of structured output to \"spill\" multiple return values into adjecent cells, it is the quickest way I know of to monitor competitors blogs everyday before my 09:00 meeting. And also the quickest way I know of to test new AI models. I have a sheet with SimpleQA, MMLUPro, or GPQA Diamond and testing a new model is a matter of adding a new column. The whole idea is to enable normal people (like, non-techies) to automate manual, repetitive tasks with AI like programmers routinely do. https://github.com/getcellm/cellm reply",

I was looking at some stuff that seemed to indicate to me that the OSA could make it difficult to self host Mastodon without providing age verification. I was then reading the provisions and realsised that it didn't really affect you unless you have at least 3 million monthly users, so in theory would not affect self hosters with only a few users. But then I thought that if you are federated with a very large instance then your users could potentially be able to interact with enough users to fall under the provisions.<p>This could potentially be a grey area that could expose self hosters to considerable risk if they are not careful.<p>I wonder if there any UK based Mastodon hosters out there who are considering this. Are you considering shutting down to prevent any liability? Could this be the \"death\" of Mastodon hosting in the UK?</p></p></div>",

If you have an instance and are below the 3m MAUs, you're likely fine. Until you're not. The moment a Mastodon instance is found to be hosting content the OSA is meant to protect minors from, that instance will be investigated and explored to the most liberal interpretation of the law, and that individual is going to find themselves either implementing age verification, shutting down that instance, or fighting their stance in court. Risk, as ever, is about likelihood, not just impact. How likely are you to find yourself hosting such content? Could you self host just for you and people known to you? Your question implies you want to set up a centralised instance with lots of people you don't know, but that's the exact scenario Mastodon is meant to counter, it's meant to be federated. And if it's just you and your mates, what's the issue? If you want to give children access, you're into another World of problems, so maybe for your own sanity - and arguably, theirs - just don't do that. reply",

          "text": "As an oldie who has lived through multiple hype cycles - Don't take the \"retire early\" crowd seriously. Over the decades, I have seen too many friends who have fallen for this story, 'hit their numbers' and loose their minds after 'retiring'. This is because the mind just unravels(unable to find meaning), if it doesn't have daily structure and purpose. You are ready to retire, not just when you are financially independent but when you have settled into a pattern that is sustainable long term, of daily 'meaning formation'. AI will create problems too. Anything that grows in complexity also generates more issues. Never less issues. Don't believe the hype. Tune it out. Focus on problems. Not tools. Another thing I learnt is - Balance the work \"has to feel good\" story with whatever responsibilities you have or will have in life. So if people depend on you or will depend on you in future, don't make the decision purely on I want work to feel like play. It's easier to keep work and play separate than to try and merge them. Both are required though for 'meaning formation' but balance it out. So look for both in separate areas. Try looking for work with teams that are multi-disciplinary. If you head back to Uni don't just roam the comp sci dept. Go look depts and ask them if they need you skills. This is where the most \"fun\" happens imho. But people head where the money is and end up doing a lot more boring stuff. Software is everywhere so you can get involved with whatever you want - chemistry, biology, astrophysics etc etc if you just go look. All the best! reply",

However, when it comes to my actual job it’s almost always weird stuff done in a weird way that there isn’t much information out there for. I have to assume a lot of companies are this way. Enterprise apps tend not to have a bunch of code examples out on GitHub for AI to train on. A couple years ago we got some professional services from a well known vendor that makes the platform we were running. What they developed was basically something you’d see in a blog post, it was useless. If that’s what AI is going to do, it’s not helpful. We ended up throwing away all their code and doing our own thing so that it would scale and not be a pain to use. As far as I can tell this will be a weakness of AI for some time to come. reply",

I'm pretty sick of the industry too. Yeah you're probably right and I suppose this is more a factor than AI itself. The company I work for has been stack ranking for about a year and a half. It's exhausting and, combined with the onslaught of AI hype, it's pretty easy to slip into a pattern of thought where I feel I contribute no value. So AI might just be the proverbial straw. It also doesn't help that the engineering landscape in Australia is a bit lacklustre when it comes to anything more complicated than web/app development. Would love to work on operating systems or crazy hardware projects like piloting software or robotics. reply",

No doubt this has drifted out-of-reach for more people across-the-board, but if you are in an area where a decent job alone is not enough and you are actually completely dependent on a decent job market in addition, that may be an unrecognized disadvantage. Whether you are still young or not, if that's the kind of situation you've been involved in your whole life it may not be easy to realize there are still many other options out there.  Not that you withdraw from market dependency completely, but it really can be overbearing if it acts as a dominating force. reply",

          "text": "Maybe move to being a program manager or something? If you truly enjoy coding, don't stop, but try to make it a hobby? I never enjoyed coding, it was a means to an end -- I was interested in systems administration and learned about infosec along the way, trying to protect my machine in an age when hard drive space was scarce and virtual machines weren't a thing -- you burned a CD and spun up Knoppix if you had decent ram... Anyways, the things AI are doing is more \"software carpentry\" than \"software engineering\". AI is not finding zero days. AI is not writing tight C to speed up I/O intensive processes. OTOH, I don't have a career -- I bounced from UX research to policy to pentesting to being a SOC analyst, trying to find just... stability, respect, and a challenging environment. When you're young it can be tempting to chase the perfect job but if you have one now, I'd try to get into a management position where you have a good work life balance. Find people you can trust to work under you, and treat them well. That isn't always a money thing -- letting them use their PTO, not screaming throwing things or hitting them, not forcing them to conduct every communication over email as if interactions that don't occur in writing are fair game to be manipulative... Anyways I think the things AI will \"solve\" are stuff like when you're tweaking some code to parse a CSV or automating the standing up of a wordpress site. As for trades? My dad was a carpenter. If things aren't being built, there's no work. It can be very boom or bust. Same goes for other trades -- having a salary and an office are big perks that a lot of folks take for granted. One thing I didn't see mentioned is uni -- especially in AUS where it's lower cost, I'd do that if you have the chance. I struggled in high school, but when I got to pick my major, pick my classes, and be surrounded by others who actually enjoy learning I found I really enjoyed school. You'll get a chance to learn to write well, in a literary way. You can also dive deep on math and coding concepts you might struggle to teach yourself. Try to find someplace that keeps your brain engaged, has good work life balance, and yes save aggressively... but your brain is still forming. You might not be the same person in ten years, in terms of ideas or tastes -- I used to be an XTREME dew chugging edgelord... now I listen to classical and drink tea. Anyways, sorry to kind of ramble but it's annoying, seeing young folks like you buy into this AI hype. It's not going to replace skilled coders, full stop -- and I'd focus on stuff like assembly, C, and other \"bare metal\" skills if you're truly concerned about that. reply",

First, as proven by the breach, privacy was not guaranteed.\nSecond, I do not see how a women-only app made to complain on men can help any men get better in their behavior, instead of balcanizing society even more, creating camps and hatred. This is not safe in itself. It won't further women's condition in their relationship with men. It alienates men even more, gives arguments to the Jordan Peterson-style toxic masculinity influencers, and inevitably fosters toxic behavior in women too. reply",

Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I came here to ask OP if they mean \"without STEM degree\", \"without STEM education\" ... Would physics degree (while STEM, it's supposedly not as close to Software/Tech as math or other types of engineering studies). Loads of such not strictly TECH folks end up in Big Tech as data scientists, as well as programmers. I only have ~25 years of \"work\" experience. I finished electrical engineering/electronics highschool (in parts of Europe you're 18 y/o by the time you finish highschool). And then just as I started with (computers focused) EE College - I also started freelancing. I started making websites/scripts/etc in the early 2000s. It turned into full time contracting, and then even moving countries for \"Software Engineering\" job - all before I finished college. Anyway - although in the last 2-5 years (Covid/Wars/etc) it became less common for companies to accept \"graduates\". My impression is that it's more about hiring freeze in general, than the more recent \"AI makes 100x developers possible\" hype. And by \"graduates\" I've seen both young folks with tech education but 0 work experience, as well as no (complete or at all official) tech education yet self taught and much more \"work experience\" from personal projects, competitions, hackathons. And of course there's also other tech stuff - UX/design, db/net/sys admins and such. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

Figured out that it was basically \"instruction manuals for computer professionals\". Realized it was a good fit. Took a bunch of basic C.S. courses at community college. Family friend got my foot in the door at an IoT startup, but it was really those C.S. classes that persuaded them to give me a try. And the fact that I would work for peanuts. Turned out that I was competent in the work and I really enjoyed programming. A few years later, Google recruited me, and I've been at Google ever since.

In my experience, not having a STEM degree is not a significant barrier to success (and as others have said, can be an advantage in specific contexts). My experience is that virtually nobody has cared, apart from some very funny compliance/procedural contexts where people assume that \"Philosophy\" means \"PhD in Computer Science.\" reply",

This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch. I do think this effect would have faded out gradually either way, markets are going to reach equilibrium.

          "text": "Worked in SA under hybrid roles including Administration/Infrastructure/Architect, for 10 years, many certifications (CCNA (expired now), and MS related certs for autopilot/MDM) no degree, top of the competency chart according to everyone I've ever worked with even the begrudging co-workers and business leaders. AI layoffs, and AI ghost jobs came along late 2022 early 2023, and I haven't been able to find a single opportunity for work since. Application to callback conversion changed from around 2-3 in 100 to the same in 1200. Roughly two years of daily applications submitted, only about 12 callbacks, 5 for pre-interview questioning, the rest were low-ball offers beneath livable wages (i.e. <34k/yr). Total, somewhere around 10,000-12,000 positions submitted to. Around 2023, 80% of my professional network was out of work, many took jobs that were beneath their capabilities (architects/SA at helpdesk) and also locked themselves into anti-competitive agreements which have made their lives harder. Today roughly 50% is still out of work, the other 30% is underemployed. The ghost job/AI fiasco also doesn't just apply to IT, it has affected every single place with an online application process. Even the local jobs for simple things like retail, grocery cashiering, etc. I've talked with a few hiring managers at local places to get the scoop, and they say they are overwhelmed with hiring because of the amount of spam which they cannot differentiate between a true applicant, has reached epic proportions; it translates into extreme cost on their side (just as it does on the applicant side). So I fell back to other skills I have, and have been self-employed ever since, albeit barely getting by between the odd jobs and welfare to pay for food with the help of family. Inflation, and constant draw without work destroyed the savings I had saved up so far for retirements; that's gone. Inflation isn't keeping pace with welfare benefits/prices so end of the month is always extremely rough where you may go a few days without food if you didn't have a means to buy and preserve ahead of time (at your own expense). I'm going back to school to retrain, because as it stands, there is no future in IT/White Collar work. I held on for two years, hoping to see some iota of a recovery, and there has been no recovery, which means it has a long way further to fall. What's worse online platforms are censoring and de-amplifying real stories like mine, which is just absolutely vile. While I don't hold a STEM degree, I have completed classwork that would meet most of the requirements to get one (i.e. Completed Multivariable Calculus, and have working knowledge of most concepts in Differential Equations/Linear Algebra/Discrete Mathematics). The world today has become completely disconnected from reality, and when that kind of distortion occurs, you get chaotic whipsaws that continue growing until the positive feedback system ends catastrophically. The profession has drilled in enough such that I know a thing or two about systems, system properties, and where it all leads. There are plenty of people who have the skills, competency, and experience to do these types of work but they can't be found because of tortious/vexatious interference of bad actors who have jammed communications beyond the Shannon Limit. At that stage of communications jamming, you get the same behavior as happens in cellular networks with RNA interference. The bad jobs block good jobs from matching up. Money-printing through debt or money-substitutes has also decoupled the need for business to act to correct destructive behaviors and cyclical dynamics they create. Its all a problem for next quarter, and by the time they realize it needs to be taken care of now and that next quarter was 4 quarters ago, its far too late. Hysteresis trap. Given the sequential nature of career development pipelines, the progression of AI,  I fully expect a complete collapse in white-collar/IT sector to be visible, losing industry knowledge in the next 3 years, and 7 years out possibly becoming lost/inaccessible knowledge/expertise (where you can't find these people no matter how much you pay). All I wanted to do for retirement was buy a small farm/homestead. That's looking pretty out of reach now given the entire lack of employment opportunity despite overwhelming effort, utilizing every possible option out there. My experience, competency isn't rewarded at all, in most cases its punished because it doesn't follow the cult of qualification. Sometimes things seem good, but you always wait for the other shoe to drop. There are plenty of STARs out there wanting work who can't find work. Many would simply go out and start their own business if they could, but financial engineering has ensured most industry have these huge cost moats, where you need to be scaled up to a certain point before you can compete, or there is regulatory preventing entry. The base-costs unscaled are operating at a loss, so its barren ground where nothing can grow. reply",

          "text": "My history is pretty wack. I have a graduate degree (MFA) in physical performance, and my work history until I was 40 was entirely in theatre: acting, writing, directing, and teaching. (And, you know, waiting tables, and selling shit, and all the other gig-work stuff actors have to do to get by). Thing is, I was always a tech nerd, too. I put up websites for every project I worked on - and plenty for friends, too - going back to the late nineties. I programmed (and sometimes physically repaired) lighting and sound systems. I built plug-ins for lighting and sound software, to solve problems various shows had. I set up networking stacks for a couple of theatres. In 2004 or so I built what was basically Brown Paper Tickets (before Brown Paper Tickets existed) for a theatre company I was working for at the time - backed by an Access database, of all things, running on an old box in the office because that's all we had to work with without paying for it. Later I built effectively MailChimp, to promote my own show. Arguably I should have monetized one or another of those tech projects, and done theatre later, but that was never the point. I enjoyed messing with tech, but didn't want to do any of it, except insofar as it made possible something else I really wanted to do. At 40 I lost my teaching job (enrollment dropped, and arts are always the first to go), and my wife and I didn't want to move, and were thinking of having a family, so I finally sold out. A restauranteur I'd worked a fair bit for in my twenties needed an IT Director for his growing company, and figured I could do it, which it turns out I can. I make three times what I did as a teacher, five or six times what I did in my best year as a working actor, and... Eh. I like my job. I'm pretty good at it, but it's what I'm doing in order to do what I really want to do, which these days is to support my family. I don't recommend my career path to anyone as a way into tech (lol!), and I think our world would be a better place if there were less money in tech, and more in arts and education. reply",

In fact, apart from Elon Musk, I am at pains to find anyone influential who has a degree. Some may insist that a degree is more common than this narrative suggests, but granted that, it seems there is a weak to nonexistent correlation between technical career success and an advanced degree.

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

          "text": "Self-taught programmer here. Went to university in '97, but flunked out after two years. The first couple years were easy. It was before the dot-com bubble burst and I lived in the bay area, so finding jobs was trivial. I worked at Adobe for a while, then Ask Jeeves (a household name from that era, for you young'uns). After the bubble burst it was a bit harder. I moved cross-country to a rural area and took tech-related jobs to make ends meet. Eventually I started working remotely for a bottom-scraping company on Long Island. There I started dating a coworker. Her father was the facilities manager for a major financial institution in Manhattan and got me an interview. I was 100% a nepotistic hire, but I worked hard and did skunkswork projects for the CTO. This was circa 2006, and once you've worked at one finance company it's easy to find related jobs. So I bounced around finance for a bit. Banks, hedge funds, etc. I worked right across the street from Lehman Brothers and watched their crash from the windows. Eventually I got married and decided I didn't want NYC kids. We decided to move back to the bay area around 2010. I found a small company I could work for while I looked for something else. I was referred into Google and started at L4. Promo'd to L5 and stayed there for a bit. In 2022 I left and did a bunch of odd stuff. The timing was really bad, and I got laid off twice, but I was lucky enough to be working again before severance ran out both times. On the whole it was probably better for me in terms of TC, but who knows. I just returned to Google last month. We'll see how this run does. Not having a degree probably hurt me in the beginning. I had to tune and A/B test my resume to get past hiring managers. I list the years I went to colleges and what I studied. I had gone to a separate university for summer extension classes while in high school, so on paper it looks like I went for 4 years, but I'm cautious to say I don't have a degree. I'm honest about it, but not forthcoming. I've had managers tell me that if they had realized, they wouldn't have hired me, but they're glad they did. I've had interviewers ask for transcripts and then take me over the coals about why I failed Intro to Viticulture and Enology 20 years ago. I've had hiring managers who needed to get creative about my title, because they didn't allow a title with \"Engineer\" in it without a degree. I've had managers throw it in my face and use it as a reason to cut me. But most of my managers never knew. I'm 25 years into my career at this point, and nobody cares. I bring it up occasionally, but with many years at multiple FAANGs, it's just not a concern. My kids know the full history and are in high school. I'm advocating for them to take a better path, but I'm aware it's their choice. The elder has severe ADHD, and my suggestion for him is to do a two year stint in the military between high school and college. I know he'll test high on the ASVAB, which means he probably won't be in a combat MOS. And I think the service will be good for him, and give him a leg up in a variety of areas. He's considering it, leaning towards air force. My younger wants to be a teacher, but isn't certain and wants to do something more creative. She's good at STEM, so we're exploring alternatives like architecture, civil engineering. reply",

Not to necessarily focus on the operating system used, but think of the attacker model and risk appetite of the organisation. What are the required integrity goals? What retention do you (legally) require? Who should be able to access those logs; on their own, or n-eye principle? Do such accesses need to be logged as well? What are the requirements from the users of the audit log? The things you'll need to log will become clear after answering such questions. How you structure them depends on the required access patterns. Tamper evidence can be achieved in many ways, but that depends on the integrity requirements; is an empty log line where one should have been enough \"tamper evident\"? Do you need some sort of verification mechanism that confirms the log lines you see were stored in that order? If your log only persists on the machine where it originated, does that satisfy integrity requirements? reply",

Claude Code grabbed tons of attention because it uses the command line and enables developers to boost their productivity. Because it works via the command line, it doesn’t require using an editor/IDE you may not use, and it’s extensible via custom slash commands and hooks. It’s only been out a few months and there’s already a cottage industry of websites, tutorials and videos supporting it. It’s not perfect but it’s really good in ways that matter to developers. I’ve never seen so many developers making videos and blogposts describing how happy they are to pay $200/month for the Max plan due to the productivity gains. reply",

Codex CLI just feels like a stripped-down version of Claude Code. Claude Code wins for me for one simple reason: I can just pay for a MAX account and not worry about running out of credits or going through my credit card limit. That makes me use the tool twice as much as the others, where I’m constantly watching my credit balance. Cursor wins because it was the first big one, not sure if it has any important advantages over claude code anymore. reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple RAG pipelines across Windsurf, Claude, and even Gemini-Codex hybrids, and I’ve learned this: Most of the current devtools are competing at the UX/UI layer — not the semantic inference layer. Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

Best of the best as far as Im aware is Qwen3 coder run in your choice of agentic coder. Up there with cloud strength in coding. BUT it's 480B. Q4_K_M is 290 GB. You're talking $50,000, rackmount, 30amp electrical going into that beast. 10x 32GB cuda cards is yikes. Here's what literally just released hours ago: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct I'm currently downloading the unsloth IQ4_NL version which should run well. This will run on a 24GB card with good context size and good speed. If you have 1x 32GB card even better. What I've been using lately. https://mistral.ai/news/devstral On a 24GB card this is great. Just look at the benchmarks and it's absolutely completely usable. Meant to be used in openhands. This absolutely is completely functioning once you get the settings correct like a low temperature and such. reply",

It uses ultrasonic sonar to detect mosquitoes, and missile control theory to ram into mosquitoes and grind them in its propellers. Our target platform is a 40 grams tinywhoop so it’s safe to fly everywhere and makes almost no noise :). A Roomba for mosquitoes! The main plus compared to traditional systems is that a drone can cover an enormous surface in a short time compared to static systems or man-portable insecticide spraying.

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

          "text": "So cool! So, I buy this brand of thin-sole shoes called Xero. Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

You don't have to make all design decisions beforehand, but can wear something for a while and then make changes based on your needs & observations. I haven't quite figured out how to apply this thinking to seam sealing though. The current garments that have taped / waterproof seams are locked into the taped configuration. For tents I have some geometrically water repellent structures (that guide the water away as long as it's coming from above), but for the soles of footwear, you might want something 100% sealed. reply",

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

I built it after my girlfriend had to manually classify 7,500 research papers. Cellm automates that kind of repetitive work. Since we added MCP and the use of structured output to \"spill\" multiple return values into adjecent cells, it is the quickest way I know of to monitor competitors blogs everyday before my 09:00 meeting. And also the quickest way I know of to test new AI models. I have a sheet with SimpleQA, MMLUPro, or GPQA Diamond and testing a new model is a matter of adding a new column. The whole idea is to enable normal people (like, non-techies) to automate manual, repetitive tasks with AI like programmers routinely do. https://github.com/getcellm/cellm reply",

          "text": "While this true enough, an ironic side effect of my attending a couple of rounds of sales related negotiation training ( compulsory for everyone at that company ), was to really highlight how calculatingly manipulative this is. I mean, we kinda all know that anyway, but somehow it reinforced it enough that I know find it actively distasteful. Even the classic sales approach of buying coffee or a meal feels creepy know, but I've had to relearn to accept it because it's just so hard to fight every time. When I tell people, the normal response is encredulous \"but it's free?\".\nIt's really really not, the costs just aren't immediately financial. (Gifts outside corporate life are generally fine, an actual human wanting to \"manipulate\" me into liking them more is generally expressing some level of affection. A corporation cannot do that) Every know and again I get something funny enough that it gets me anyway.. I'm very fond of my all blue Rubic's cube from ibm for example, and I've got a few unbranded water bottles around the place. Anything else I can't politely refuse just gets binned as soon as I can do so without a fuss. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am not currently a user of Mastodon, but I have some interest in the project. I was looking at some stuff that seemed to indicate to me that the OSA could make it difficult to self host Mastodon without providing age verification. I was then reading the provisions and realsised that it didn't really affect you unless you have at least 3 million monthly users, so in theory would not affect self hosters with only a few users. But then I thought that if you are federated with a very large instance then your users could potentially be able to interact with enough users to fall under the provisions.<p>This could potentially be a grey area that could expose self hosters to considerable risk if they are not careful.<p>I wonder if there any UK based Mastodon hosters out there who are considering this. Are you considering shutting down to prevent any liability? Could this be the \"death\" of Mastodon hosting in the UK?</p></p></div>",

If you have an instance and are below the 3m MAUs, you're likely fine. Until you're not.

Risk, as ever, is about likelihood, not just impact. How likely are you to find yourself hosting such content? Could you self host just for you and people known to you? Your question implies you want to set up a centralised instance with lots of people you don't know, but that's the exact scenario Mastodon is meant to counter, it's meant to be federated.

One friend, who did his university studies in Europe, responded with: \n\"A friend of a friend is doing a computer science bachelor's. Same place I did mine. But the easier version. And he doesn't know anything, everybody just cheats on everything.\"<p>Of course, this is anecdata. But I've never heard him be so strongly opinionated about university.<p>So I'm simply asking the question to see if there's nuance to this discussion or whether this is becoming the new normal rapidly. Or perhaps I'm just in a bubble.<p>I'm open to your experiences about this and what you all know.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They undervalued it in terms of the technical skills I've learned simply because they projected their educational experiences onto mine. That's what that it is.

I guess new grads have to make a portfolio on the side and take care of the code quality. Because even if you vibe coded that application, vibe coding a project with high code quality still shows a strong skill in programming as LLMs aren't there yet to do that fully themselves? Like, how are skillful new grads supposed to show their skill when everyone (is about to) believe their education doesn't show any evidence of skill? And yea, I agree, cheaters will be cheaters.

If you genuinely think people should pay 100 grand just for the joy of learning from a professor in person and being surrounded by a bunch of other people without expecting a financial return, then yes I think that's completely intellectually dishonest.  It might sound insulting, and it kind of is, but I don't think I'm wrong. This is coming from someone who has been a university lecturer, and has been part of a PhD program.   It's not like I'm completely speaking out of my ass here. ETA: To be clear, I am not saying there are no positives to in-person university and I'm not saying university has no value over self-learning.  I'm saying it's expensive and I take issue with your statement of \"If you feel that the purpose of higher education is just to get a job, you are already off-track.\" It's a potentially six-figure investment.   It's not weird or wrong for people to do it to get a better job. reply",

          "text": "Overall, I think it's still credible, but less credible than before, and heavily depends on your situation. I run a program for students as a replacement for university, so I'm a bit biased when it comes to this discussion. It's useful to analyze both what a student want out of a degree and how a degree is \"consumed\" by another party (ex. an employer). 1. University degrees are still the \"gold standard\" in socially accepted proof-of-education. I think this is mostly due to social momentum. A few years of a \"bad batch\", ex. due to rampant cheating etc, will not change this. When I talk to other hiring managers, it's a bit of mixed bag. Some sorta understand where the students are coming from, as they also think that a lot of courses etc are arbitrary. Others are more concerned about the ethics of cheating, and the implications on a student's character, rather than the education outcomes (\"I can work with inexperience, I can't tolerate lying\"). 2. If you're planning to pursue a heavily regulated profession, like medicine, you most likely need a degree. 3. As others pointed out, the university criteria now more closely resembles a toll someone must pay to access higher-paying jobs. Ie. it's less about education than gatekeeping. Having it doesn't make you qualified. Not having it disqualifies you in many people's eyes. I think this is partially driving a lot of the cheating. Students sense the disconnect from the university program (and schooling in general) vs real skills. It's just another hoop they have to jump through so they will choose the path of least resistance. For many parents, it's a sort of capstone project for a parenting job well-done. And that adds more to the complexity. 4. How you take advantage of your university experience matters. I wouldn't count on the university for a durable education, ie. actually teaching you things that will make you successful. You need to get that elsewhere (thus the emphasis on work experience). But the social momentum is important, as universities are social centers for young adults, so you may get socially isolated if you don't go. In this case, the value is in the network, not so much the programs etc. The university experience, despite it's flaws, is still the status quo and definitely the safer \"bet\". Unless a person have clear understanding of why they shouldn't go, they should probably still go. reply",

          "text": "In some ways, it's not better. I agree that the shift is now going towards more real-world experience rather than academics. Part of the motivation for me to create the program was to introduce more self-direction and real-world problems[1]. In addition, I think it's useful to separate education from schooling. What we often confound is the actual acquisition of useful knowledge (fundamental meaning of education) and our institutions (education systems). Learning on your own is very much education! However, I think employment etc are more complex than just education. There are other factors, like social acceptability, political risk, etc. I've talked to managers who are just risk-averse when it comes to non-degreed students. They'll privately accept that this person has all the skills, maybe even more so than other candidates, but they can't accept them because if this candidate messes up, they will get blamed for hiring them. The political risk is too much, and would be much less if the candidate has more degrees. The systems of accountability is messed up but that's the reality young people have to navigate. They have to understand the markedness of not having a degree. It's sorta like the social version of \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" Depending on what they want to do, the degree won't matter. If you start your own company, obviously no one will care if you have a degree. Some investors see it as a plus. You can argue that putting a 4-yr university tuition as startup capital will teach more useful skills than a degree, even if they don't pursue entrepreneurship later. But most people are not willing or can't take those risks. [1] https://www.divepod.to reply",

          "text": "I started working in 1996 and I am on my 10th job.  While my resumes have always been pretty good - I still have electronic copies of every version of my resume except the first one I used out of college in 1996  - they have only been the deciding factor of my getting my first job out of college and my third job after being out of the loop too long in 2008. 1.  Outreach to local external recruiters in Atlanta where I lived until 2022 and talking to them either in person in their office, meeting them for lunch  or on the phone - found jobs in 1999, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018.  I’ve never had a local reliable recruiter submit my resume and it not lead to at least an interview and very very few rejections (I’ve kept spreadsheets since 2012). 2.  Mindlessly submitting my resume on job boards - once in 2008 after staying at one job for 9 years. 3. Internal recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn - 2020 (my one, only and hopefully last job at BigTech) and 2024 4. Targeted outreach to companies where I had a non commodity set of skills and experience they were looking for - 2023. If you are blindly submitting your resume to an ATS, you’ve already lost. In 2023, I was Amazoned after 3.5 years.  The first time I actively looked for a remote job (that one fell into my lap).  I had a great resume, credentialed, keyword matched to all of the top cloud skills and experience, over a decade (on my resume) of development and experience and leading projects. I submitted my resume to hundreds of jobs and my application was rarely opened (LinkedIn shows you) and every job had hundreds of applications.  I heard crickets. Using my network I had two offers for full time jobs within two weeks and one short term contracts. Targeted outreach based on some niches where at the time I was considered an industry expert (see time at AWS) led to two other interviews within two weeks and one offer. Hiring managers barely read your resume, they definitely aren’t going to take the time to go out and read your blog posts or a random GitHub profile.  Open source opened doors for me in 2023.  But that was only because at the time I was the second highest contributor to a popular official “AWS solution” in its niche.  No one cared about the other open source work I did, published to AWS’s official GitHub repository and had on my profile and a linked to. The other work wasn’t some one off.  I’ve used it personally at 2 other companies since I left. reply",

          "text": "As an oldie who has lived through multiple hype cycles - Don't take the \"retire early\" crowd seriously. Over the decades, I have seen too many friends who have fallen for this story, 'hit their numbers' and loose their minds after 'retiring'. This is because the mind just unravels(unable to find meaning), if it doesn't have daily structure and purpose. You are ready to retire, not just when you are financially independent but when you have settled into a pattern that is sustainable long term, of daily 'meaning formation'. AI will create problems too. Anything that grows in complexity also generates more issues. Never less issues. Don't believe the hype. Tune it out. Focus on problems. Not tools. Another thing I learnt is - Balance the work \"has to feel good\" story with whatever responsibilities you have or will have in life. So if people depend on you or will depend on you in future, don't make the decision purely on I want work to feel like play. It's easier to keep work and play separate than to try and merge them. Both are required though for 'meaning formation' but balance it out. So look for both in separate areas. Try looking for work with teams that are multi-disciplinary. If you head back to Uni don't just roam the comp sci dept. Go look depts and ask them if they need you skills. This is where the most \"fun\" happens imho. But people head where the money is and end up doing a lot more boring stuff. Software is everywhere so you can get involved with whatever you want - chemistry, biology, astrophysics etc etc if you just go look. All the best! reply",

However, when it comes to my actual job it’s almost always weird stuff done in a weird way that there isn’t much information out there for. I have to assume a lot of companies are this way. Enterprise apps tend not to have a bunch of code examples out on GitHub for AI to train on. A couple years ago we got some professional services from a well known vendor that makes the platform we were running. What they developed was basically something you’d see in a blog post, it was useless. If that’s what AI is going to do, it’s not helpful. We ended up throwing away all their code and doing our own thing so that it would scale and not be a pain to use. As far as I can tell this will be a weakness of AI for some time to come. reply",

I'm pretty sick of the industry too. Yeah you're probably right and I suppose this is more a factor than AI itself. The company I work for has been stack ranking for about a year and a half. It's exhausting and, combined with the onslaught of AI hype, it's pretty easy to slip into a pattern of thought where I feel I contribute no value. So AI might just be the proverbial straw. It also doesn't help that the engineering landscape in Australia is a bit lacklustre when it comes to anything more complicated than web/app development. Would love to work on operating systems or crazy hardware projects like piloting software or robotics. reply",

Whether you are still young or not, if that's the kind of situation you've been involved in your whole life it may not be easy to realize there are still many other options out there.

          "text": "Maybe move to being a program manager or something? If you truly enjoy coding, don't stop, but try to make it a hobby? I never enjoyed coding, it was a means to an end -- I was interested in systems administration and learned about infosec along the way, trying to protect my machine in an age when hard drive space was scarce and virtual machines weren't a thing -- you burned a CD and spun up Knoppix if you had decent ram... Anyways, the things AI are doing is more \"software carpentry\" than \"software engineering\". AI is not finding zero days. AI is not writing tight C to speed up I/O intensive processes. OTOH, I don't have a career -- I bounced from UX research to policy to pentesting to being a SOC analyst, trying to find just... stability, respect, and a challenging environment. When you're young it can be tempting to chase the perfect job but if you have one now, I'd try to get into a management position where you have a good work life balance. Find people you can trust to work under you, and treat them well. That isn't always a money thing -- letting them use their PTO, not screaming throwing things or hitting them, not forcing them to conduct every communication over email as if interactions that don't occur in writing are fair game to be manipulative... Anyways I think the things AI will \"solve\" are stuff like when you're tweaking some code to parse a CSV or automating the standing up of a wordpress site. As for trades? My dad was a carpenter. If things aren't being built, there's no work. It can be very boom or bust. Same goes for other trades -- having a salary and an office are big perks that a lot of folks take for granted. One thing I didn't see mentioned is uni -- especially in AUS where it's lower cost, I'd do that if you have the chance. I struggled in high school, but when I got to pick my major, pick my classes, and be surrounded by others who actually enjoy learning I found I really enjoyed school. You'll get a chance to learn to write well, in a literary way. You can also dive deep on math and coding concepts you might struggle to teach yourself. Try to find someplace that keeps your brain engaged, has good work life balance, and yes save aggressively... but your brain is still forming. You might not be the same person in ten years, in terms of ideas or tastes -- I used to be an XTREME dew chugging edgelord... now I listen to classical and drink tea. Anyways, sorry to kind of ramble but it's annoying, seeing young folks like you buy into this AI hype. It's not going to replace skilled coders, full stop -- and I'd focus on stuff like assembly, C, and other \"bare metal\" skills if you're truly concerned about that. reply",

Not to necessarily focus on the operating system used, but think of the attacker model and risk appetite of the organisation. What are the required integrity goals? What retention do you (legally) require? Who should be able to access those logs; on their own, or n-eye principle? Do such accesses need to be logged as well? What are the requirements from the users of the audit log? The things you'll need to log will become clear after answering such questions. How you structure them depends on the required access patterns. Tamper evidence can be achieved in many ways, but that depends on the integrity requirements; is an empty log line where one should have been enough \"tamper evident\"? Do you need some sort of verification mechanism that confirms the log lines you see were stored in that order? If your log only persists on the machine where it originated, does that satisfy integrity requirements? reply",

Do you have hundreds of books and articles in your to-read list, but wish you could extract the main ideas faster? The goal of Shortform is to make the world's best ideas more accessible. We started by creating the world's best book guides, with in-depth chapter-by-chapter summaries, original insights building on the book, and distillation of ideas into actionables. They're like superpowered book summaries. Our ultimate goal is to index every idea on Earth and make sense of it. Specifically, we want to summarize and contextualize every meaningful idea published each day, in every form of media (books, articles, podcasts, videos, news, research papers). Illustrative ideas include a news summarizer that shows the entire spectrum of opinions on a topic to help avoid polarization, and mini-courses that draw from the best sources across media to teach a topic (eg to learn negotiation, start with this book, then listen to this interview, then see these news articles for the principles at work, do these exercises). If ideas like these interest you, please apply. -------- Company status: We launched 6 years ago. Shortform was funded by the founder (who has built multiple bootstrapped profitable companies in the past) and has taken on no outside investment. Our financials allow us to be profitable, but currently we're reinvesting in growth. Engineering team consists of 10 full-stack engineers. Technology: Vue.js on frontend, Flask / Python on backend, with heavy R&D in AI / LLM / GPT. (Keywords for searchers with tech flexibility: Angular, React, Django | BERT, LLaMA, Natural Language Processing / NLP, Large Language Models, ML) About the role: Ideally you're fullstack on the web, and comfortable on both front-end and back-end. Position is remote (current team is worldwide). Fulltime roles preferred; hours negotiable for strong candidates. We're able to pay competitive market salaries (i.e. not decreased by equity). Email jobs+engineerhn@shortform.com to get more details about the company, what we're building, and the application process. In your email, please discuss your experience for our stack, and also your favorite non-fiction book (to help us screen spam emails). reply",

There may be upsets, though sudden and dramatic change are not how these things work (however they appear post dramatically).

Even so, the housing market problem is largely a modern one - we went from a society where the majority of homes were multi-generational to one where homes are nuclear. So per capita, the demand for homes has skyrocketed. But also as baby boomers are retiring and shedding assets, I would anticipate this situation could improve itself in 10-20 years. The administration is doing some pretty horrible stuff by modern first world standards, but is not actually out of alignment with how politics existed before the Cold War. We'll probably witness the end of Pax Americana, but society can continue to exist even in illiberal times where war and violence are more common. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.<p>But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.<p>After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.<p>After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.<p>When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.<p>Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.<p>Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.<p>Should I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Coding has nothing to do with degrees. It's actually a huge waste of time. Unless you are studying to be a doctor or a lawyer, school is waste of time and money and has huge opportunity costs. So definitely do not even think about masters. I have started fiddling with HTML around 2000, PHP in 2004, then Go in 2018-ish. I always worked with websites, though thanks to Go, nowadays it is mostly backend related and lower level stuff. Anyway, I say this as I have seen the market develop for quarter of a century. And what you are experiencing is simply saturated market. Everyone thinks they can write code nowadays and so there is too much supply. Then add the the \"AI\" crap and you find yourself very quickly being obsolete. The real economy is tanking, despite fake numbers propping up the stock market, one just needs to glance at massive tech layoffs since 2022 to realise the time is up. So not a good time to be a newbie in this field. But is that really so? No, absolutely not. My whole \"career\", I worked in niches and that always paid my bills. And I always recommend the same. Don't be a generalist, specialise on something unique where there is little competition and sufficient demand and stability. It can be absolutely anything imaginable, just make sure you become an expert in this niche. This will then allow you to easily filter out job advertisements so you can focus on jobs where you will have high chance of being a fit for and also experience little competition, comparatively to the rest of the job market. Last tip, focus on the east, not on the dying west. The future is in China when it comes to tech. There is competition, but again, keyword is \"niche\". And the job market is there and will be there. As you are in Iraq, that poses quite a problem, even for remote work. So you might be forced to look for middle eastern countries with tech jobs. I guess UAE would be my pick as from what I hear the salaries are great and supply is low, mostly because nobody wants to move there. Also you would have no time zone issues for remote work. Either way, you have to think in the context of your situation in general and make decisions based on your capabilities and options. reply",

Some people mentioned starting your own project above. I think that’s a really great path. I was in a similar situation: I started learning programming about five years ago. I don’t have a technical background at all — I’m actually a humanities student. I didn’t choose programming because it was trendy. I chose it because something inside me said, “This is my path.” At the time, I lost my job. I had several children to take care of. It was a tough time, but I kept learning every day - step by step. And now? I create things. Not for money yet - for craftsmanship, for freedom, for the future. And little by little, doors are opening. That’s why I say: follow your heart, but don’t forget about your mind. No problem is unsolvable. Sometimes the road is long. But it’s still a road. reply",

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

          "text": "I'm continuing the work on Cellm, an Excel extension that let's you call LLMs in cell formulas like =PROMPT(A1, \"Rate the sentiment of the customer feedback as positive, neutral, or negative\"), and then drag the formula down to apply the same prompt to thousands of rows. I built it after my girlfriend had to manually classify 7,500 research papers. Cellm automates that kind of repetitive work. Since we added MCP and the use of structured output to \"spill\" multiple return values into adjecent cells, it is the quickest way I know of to monitor competitors blogs everyday before my 09:00 meeting. And also the quickest way I know of to test new AI models. I have a sheet with SimpleQA, MMLUPro, or GPQA Diamond and testing a new model is a matter of adding a new column. The whole idea is to enable normal people (like, non-techies) to automate manual, repetitive tasks with AI like programmers routinely do. https://github.com/getcellm/cellm reply",

When people start relying on the \"I just want it to work this way\" mentality and let AI take over, they can lose track of how things actually work under the hood. And that opens the door to a lot of problems — not just bugs, but blind trust in things they don't understand. For me, the joy is in understanding. Understanding what each part does, how it all fits together.\nIf that disappears, I think we lose something important along the way. reply",

I’m not saying everyone needs to go all the way down to the metal — but I do think it’s important to at least understand the boundaries. Know what’s underneath, even if you don’t touch it every day. Otherwise, it’s not engineering anymore — it’s guessing. And I’ve never been good at just “believing” things work. I need to poke around, break them, fix them.\nThat’s how I learn.

If not, they may ignore/be unaware of problems that are existential to the company. * Will they have the capacity to deal with non-tech issues? Running a company, esp a fast growing company, is too much work for one person to handle. * Can they attract other talent to work for them? If they're a solo, are they difficult to work with/for? It'd be good to address some of these underlying issues, rather than check the box. * As you mentioned, having previous success helps alleviate some of the concerns. * If your product is growing very quickly, they may take the risk. * Finding another potential cofounder organically as a pre-condition for funding. VCs will rarely force you to find a co-founder. That might actually introduce further friction into the team and risk the investment. The hope would be for you to find another person with whom you have good working relationships, which is the key. Even if they're also technically inclined, they can be trained to handle the other sides of the business. Generally speaking, it's easier to train a tech founder on sales/business skills, rather than vice-versa. Personally, I'd recommend you continue building, but with the intent to find other folks who are also interested in the product/business. It'll be good for you whether you decide to get venture fund or not. reply",

So convincing evidence would be success or an obvious different reason for solo status like just got out of prison.

          "text": "Some models often report their training hardware. It doesn't take 5min to figure out that you can't \"catch up\" with it. If you have the resources to \"catch up\", you would probably not ask poorly stated questions on HN, unless you have ulterior motives (which might be harmless, or not). It seems like a question designed to steer people who might be unaware of such limitations into believing they can somehow buy cheap hardware and make their own datacenter, which is a weird propositon. That's an absurd idea, and such things would only be valuable for cheap spammy purposes (I've been investigating those schemes for a while). So, we have a few scenarios here: - Beginner guy who's too lazy to research for himself. - Scammer trying to dump off hardware that was used for scams into other people's hands (my favorite kind of investigative meal). - Someone else that is doing the same kind of investigative work I'm doing. My answer suits these three profiles. It would humble the beginner, scare the shit out of the scammer, and elicit some respect from the investigator. I know this is hard to follow, but keep focus on why these kinds of profiles are important. If you can think of another one, please share it, and I would rethink my answer in favor of that. reply",

Best of the best as far as Im aware is Qwen3 coder run in your choice of agentic coder. Up there with cloud strength in coding. BUT it's 480B. Q4_K_M is 290 GB. You're talking $50,000, rackmount, 30amp electrical going into that beast. 10x 32GB cuda cards is yikes. Here's what literally just released hours ago: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct I'm currently downloading the unsloth IQ4_NL version which should run well. This will run on a 24GB card with good context size and good speed. If you have 1x 32GB card even better. What I've been using lately. https://mistral.ai/news/devstral On a 24GB card this is great. Just look at the benchmarks and it's absolutely completely usable. Meant to be used in openhands. This absolutely is completely functioning once you get the settings correct like a low temperature and such. reply",

I was looking at some stuff that seemed to indicate to me that the OSA could make it difficult to self host Mastodon without providing age verification. I was then reading the provisions and realsised that it didn't really affect you unless you have at least 3 million monthly users, so in theory would not affect self hosters with only a few users. But then I thought that if you are federated with a very large instance then your users could potentially be able to interact with enough users to fall under the provisions.<p>This could potentially be a grey area that could expose self hosters to considerable risk if they are not careful.<p>I wonder if there any UK based Mastodon hosters out there who are considering this. Are you considering shutting down to prevent any liability? Could this be the \"death\" of Mastodon hosting in the UK?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "While this true enough, an ironic side effect of my attending a couple of rounds of sales related negotiation training ( compulsory for everyone at that company ), was to really highlight how calculatingly manipulative this is. I mean, we kinda all know that anyway, but somehow it reinforced it enough that I know find it actively distasteful. Even the classic sales approach of buying coffee or a meal feels creepy know, but I've had to relearn to accept it because it's just so hard to fight every time. When I tell people, the normal response is encredulous \"but it's free?\".\nIt's really really not, the costs just aren't immediately financial. (Gifts outside corporate life are generally fine, an actual human wanting to \"manipulate\" me into liking them more is generally expressing some level of affection. A corporation cannot do that) Every know and again I get something funny enough that it gets me anyway.. I'm very fond of my all blue Rubic's cube from ibm for example, and I've got a few unbranded water bottles around the place. Anything else I can't politely refuse just gets binned as soon as I can do so without a fuss. reply",

          "text": "London | In person/hybrid or Abroad | Remote Magic position for people who know HEAPs about the playwright testing framework. We are an early stage company with a different, and we hope refreshing attitude, towards work. We think it’s okay to not be obsessed with your job. We think if you’re a bit older (out of your 20s) you might be more of a guide for others (a Gandalf) than a power train (we hire young people for that energy who are eager to learn from you). We invest a lot in our team. We pay for you to have therapy (optional), but we want you to have it as we think you’ll be happier, calmer and “unblock” yourself. We spend half a day a week reading documentation and doing nothing else, and another full day coaching the team on cutting edge tech (how to design, build, train, deploy ai models). We’re based in London, but open to applications from anywhere. The main thing is that you have a well of knowledge about the open source playwright framework! Personal email in bio reply",

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance.

About Solace: The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients & improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes. We're a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast. Check out our funding announcement in the WSJ here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-coverage-fuels-solaces...

We're an Austin TX based company on a mission to build the world’s largest decentralized food production network, starting with AI powered chicken Coops.  We’ve been in the market for about 18 months and our customers are in 48 states and will generate about >5M eggs this year. It's insanely fun to work on and we have a shot at building a huge business in the connected urban farming space. If you’re big into computer vision, consumer products that are fun, and an awesome team we would love to chat. The Coop has an automatic door + cameras doing computer vision work (predator detection, egg alerts, remote health monitoring, etc). It's a super exciting time and are seeing directional product market fit which I'm thrilled about. Seriously go check out our website, it's a super fun + amazing product. We’re a tight-knit team of 6 people with 15+ years of experience working together. We’ve been through YC, started and scaled multinational million-dollar businesses together, taking them from idea to acquisition by a Fortune 50 company. We’re gritty and passionate without taking ourselves too seriously - and we’re here to build something really exciting that helps people reconnect with their food and the planet. We're VC backed (call it $5M) by some of the world's best investors but we are a scrappy small team that moves fast. We have an absolutely fantastic CTO Ryan that I'm looking for his / our right hand person to work alongside with. I think the term full stack is overused but that's closest to what we're looking for. Also this really isn’t a traditional Eng role, I look at it as we’re a small growing team and you would be one of us working on a ton a cool projects on day 1. Also, we LOVE working with founders so if you've started a company before that's epic. You can also reach out to me directly at: aj[at]coop.farm - Just email me your LinkedIn / GitHub / portfolio + why you think you'll be an awesome fit and I'll respond. This is my 3rd company (2 have exited) and I want to build the super solid core team and you might be the perfect fit for us and vice versa. Bwok Bwok! AJ reply",

We’re building deep, vertically integrated technology systems to solve fundamental problems in US healthcare - the biggest market in the world ($5T).

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip - Community engagement platform for soccer fans. Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire! reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual. I am always looking to improve not only myself but also my work. reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking.

I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

Resume: LinkedIn -- https://www.linkedin.com/in/wcunning Email: wdocunningham@gmail.com Background: Masters in control theory and signal processing, working in the auto industry for the last 7 years, first on low level powertrain software then the last year or so on LIDAR/computer vision for autonomous vehicles. I've done the most work in C, but I'm now contributing to safety development work with the Rust consortium and Ferrous Systems through my current employer. Recently had to read the Linux kernel source and use the BCC tool suite to find a subtle issue in the network stack causing high latency on sensor data for AV, also coincidentally fixed most of the network timing infrastructure. Currently doing software defined vehicle software architecture with a focus on fail-safe and fail-operational, loosely coupled, distributed systems. This includes some standards contributions and work with high level suppliers like Nvidia and Renesas for next-generation software/hardware system co-development. Primary skills include hard real time embedded systems, safety critical applications, firmware development, system integration and complex hardware/software interaction debugging, along with detailed data analysis problems. Side interests include machining, 3D printing, embedded system development, coffee roasting and furniture making. reply",

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmior/ Email: michael@mior.ca I'm a computer science professor with a PhD looking to make a move back to industry. I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others. I have 10+ years experience as a researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me. I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles. The technology used is less important to me than an interesting product and a great team.

Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paddymullen/ Email: paddy@paddymullen.com I'm a developer who believes code isn't valuable unless it's used. That's why I start with conversations, not commits. I work to understand real problems before reaching for shiny new packages. I build tools that are simple, effective, and easy to adopt. My goal is always to solve the problem and make sure people know there’s a solution. In my next role, I'm looking to work with a team that values clarity and impact. I'm especially interested in data heavy environments where thoughtful tooling can make workflows better. Most recently, I built [Buckaroo]( https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo ) an open source data table for Jupyter using Pandas/Polars. It combines fast rendering, summary stats, and a low-code UI. It scratches an itch I've had for over a decade and has already streamlined my own analysis workflow. reply",

Right now I'm looking for technical PM or design roles, but am open to other opportunities. I've worked on developer tools for much of my career, so I'm extremely comfortable working closely with engineers. That includes time working on .NET SDKs and Visual Studio while at Microsoft, as well as doing design work for DevOps tools. Right now my preference would probably be for teams working on dev tools, but I'm also somewhat familiar with the veterinary industry and would be interested in doing something there. Remote roles only with the exception of roles local to Philadelphia or at companies based in New York where I can make an occasional trip up. I'm a US citizen but have also recently acquired Italian citizenship and am interested in working for an EU-based company, if remote hires are possible. reply",

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me!

Something I do see happening is companies are doing a lot of low hanging fruit themselves in my space (I do revenue and business analytics). Today, they will get 80% of my specialty done themselves. That is enough for most companies. But that last 20% for those who want it, still requires a specialist like me who knows the domain entirely. reply",

There just weren't enough programmers on earth to take up the load of writing all the software that would be necessary. So new tools, like COBOL and ALGOL, were devised to help programmers produce correct software quickly. Today's software crisis is not one of too little but too much. We are absolutely spoiled for computing power -- a smartphone having enough capacity to replace a mainframe that in the 1970s or 1980s would have handled a national bank's transactions, many times over . We are awash in software, most of it bad. We need less software and better software. Stochastic slop generators are going to make this problem worse, not better. It may be a rough few years, but on the other side there will be a boom in demand for programmers to clean up the mess \"AI\" has made. reply",

Some are great to just merge, others you have no clue what they are doing wrong but it's totally them; and you get paid in github stars? Now there's a bunch of open source projects that are just working for me every day, but i havent modified in years and they look stagnant. but even in the non-open source realm, no dev wants to forever maintain a project.

          "text": "I started a job hunt support standup group. I asked around in various tech communities I was already apart of for other job seekers who were interested. Once I had a small group, we picked a time we were all free to do a video call standup. I think it was twice a week. We’d do the usual “what we completed, what’s in progress, what we’re doing next”, then people could stay on the call to chat. We ended up giving each other mock interviews, making connections, and doing resume reviews outside of the standup. Having the support of other people going through a similar experience was very helpful, and the accountability helped keep me motivated. It was easy to set up. If people got annoyed about something like wanting to join but having a schedule conflict, or not liking the format the group wanted, I cheerfully said that’s a great idea, and suggested they start a new group. Setting that limit got rid of a lot of the annoying parts of organizing events. The group changed as people got hired or dropped out, and when I got hired I handed it off to other group members. Job hunting sucks. Having support makes it way easier. reply",

Limit searching to 2 to 3 hours MAX a day. 2) Get exercise.  A regular scheduled DAILY is best. 3) Study / learn something.  Ideally have a theme or plan.  It is useful for the interview question of 'So what have you been doing the last 6 months'.  Yes looking for a job, but they want to hear you are doing something. 4) Reach out to see if there are job hunting club in your area.  They could help identify something you might be doing wrong. 'Well I think a hawaiian shirt is my favorite' :) 4 b) if you know others looking, set up a weekly meeting to encourage each other and provide a sense of stability. 5) Join toastmasters.  Trust me on this, it will help immensely in the interview. 6) Make an itemized list of what your job requirements are.  What are you not willing to compromise on. 6 b) after 3 months, look at that list and decide what needs to go.  It broke my heart to move, but it was what I had to do. 7) Volunteer.  Preferably in person as it is a GREAT way to network.  If you are a techie, you could do some opensource project, but volunteering still in person is much better. reply",

          "text": "Here's some more generalized advice about avoiding burnout while job-seeking/interviewing. I would say the best way to avoid burnout and get better results is to tailor your resume to each job posting. Most people send out general resumes which causes a candidate to blend into the crowd. My sister used to be in HR and sometimes they only have a small amount of time to skim each resume. So in your cover letter and resume you want to show off your interest in the company and skills right off the bat. Think of the job posting as bullet points, hit the major points they are looking for in the brief intro paragraph, they will have more incentive to give you an interview. If you know a graphic designer, it may be worth in to get a custom resume design. Though templates work too, just make sure to not pick a commonly used template. Consider templates on Gumroad or similar sites if you are on a budget. Another Interview Point. If it takes them 7 interviews to decide on a candidate don't bother with that company. It shows you that they are a.) Don't have their act together. A red flag for incompetence. b.) Are looking for a unicorn candidate and are just stringing you along as a backup candidate. c.) Already know who they want to hire but have to play \"the hiring game\" so they can justify why they hired their chosen candidate. I worked with a company that had me do 5 interviews to get the job and it wasn't a great experience. I ended up quitting due to the management and lack of support. My advice is a 3 interviews rule. If the company can't figure out if they want you after 3 interviews it is best to look elsewhere. You have to remember that your time has value. Hope this helps. reply",

The best jobs I've had were after 7+ rounds of actual interviews: code challenge, several peer panels, systems design, hiring manager, Senior manager, Cutler fit, etc. That of course doesn't mean there aren't companies out there abusing the system or who have less than genuine tactics.

Have a \"no politics\" rule unless you want culture warring on your platform for whatever reason. - Then you enforce the rules as you see fit. The final rule should be \"moderators have discretion\" and if someone is pushing against the rules and/or irritating others, ban them. At the same time, be lenient and give second and third chances at least for non-blatant offenses; escalate, first with a warning, then with a temp ban, then a longer temp ban, etc. It's a careful balance, but if done correctly, your form will be both tolerant and not dominated by assholes. - To prevent spam and banned users opening new accounts, either: make the form invite-only (where users can invite others) and screen applicants; charge a small fee for signing up; require flexible proof of identity (e.g. one of: phone #, Google account, GitHub account, Facebook account, etc.); require new user posts to be approved by moderators before they show up; or something else. This will make it significantly harder for your userbase to grow, and many people will refuse to sign up, but it will be hard and some people won't sign up anyways. - If your forum grows enough, you can recruit moderators. You need enough people and activity to select moderators who you trust, because every time you override their moderation or kick them beyond \"very rarely\", you look worse (more incompetent, power-tripping, incoherent) and the overall community \"vibes\" become slightly more toxic. reply",

We have a hybrid system: everyone gets basic voting rights (maintaining the democratic principle you describe), but we also have weighted \"contribution votes\" based on earned influence. So it's not replacing democracy, but adding a parallel track. Basic decisions use equal votes, but for governance and quality decisions, contribution-based weight provides additional input. Think of it as \"democracy plus meritocracy\" rather than replacing one with the other. But we believe: hybrid democracy is also democracy. Just as representative democracy and direct democracy are both legitimate forms of democratic governance, contribution-weighted democracy can preserve democratic legitimacy while addressing practical concerns about informed participation. This way we preserve the fundamental democratic principle you're defending - everyone has a voice - while creating mechanisms for those most invested in outcomes to have proportional influence. Do you think this hybrid approach maintains democratic legitimacy while addressing some of the practical concerns about informed decision-making? reply",

You provided the most thoughtful theoretical framework in this entire discussion, and I responded with just a throwaway line. That wasn't respectful of the depth you brought. Your analysis of Habermas and \"perfect deliberative process\" is exactly what we're grappling with in GistFans. The tension you identify between early adopter quality and scalability, the corruption of sustainable organizations vs the power of \"structureless\" activism - these are the core contradictions we're trying to navigate. We're experimenting with a \"Stars\" system where users earn influence through contributions, then spend these stars on governance decisions. The hypothesis: when participation has real cost (earned influence), people might act more thoughtfully - potentially addressing both the good faith problem AND the \"believing others act in bad faith\" issue you mention about Twitter. But your point about \"benign despotism with exit rights\" is fascinating. Maybe the key isn't eliminating hierarchy but making it transparent and merit-based rather than arbitrary? We're deliberately staying small and experimental rather than chasing sustainability/growth. Better to run genuine experiments that inform future builders than create another corrupted institution. Have you seen any examples where contribution-based influence actually improved deliberative quality? Or do the fundamental human nature issues make this unsolvable through design? reply",

The \"retaliation equilibrium\" working initially is fascinating - shows that peer accountability can work at small scale. But the faction coordination problem seems almost inevitable as communities grow. Makes me think the key might be preventing large factions from forming in the first place, rather than trying to make democracy work despite them. reply",

Democracy as Socrates or written by Plato would have said democracy is hard to succeed at as it’s ruled by many who may not have the education.. wisdom.. to run well for all. Read Ship of State. A certain level of freedom of speech is required, or else it’s a pool of similar thinkers. A collective who everyone else must talk and think alike, for the good of the collective. See Ayn Rand. Pretty much like downvoting, I get downvoted without knowing who or why and is a form of censorship and one or more are offended or just don’t like it. Just cuz you don’t like it doesn’t mean it should be downvoted. My other comment here on YT shorts being useful is an example. A down vote and all I said is “ I learnt drums for a song I like from shorts. Blanket bans are not a solution” Take care to not apply so much policy that group think and collectivism takes hold. reply",

          "text": "You're absolutely right about these concerns, and I should be more honest - we don't have a magic solution to groupthink. Even our transparency isn't absolute - we only guarantee proposal transparency, not complete visibility. But I think a community's real vitality might come from self-direction rather than top-down solutions. Democratic processes themselves promote community self-purification. In our ideal community, everyone has the right to propose. Every proposal goes to public vote with open voting. When proposals pass and get executed, that execution itself improves the community. This might be closer to what an ideal community looks like. Our ideal community has only one rule: community-driven. That's all. I tend to describe it as a kind of utopia - where the community continuously evolves through its own collective decisions rather than having solutions imposed from outside. Maybe the answer to groupthink isn't preventing it, but creating systems where the community can organically correct itself over time. It's admittedly idealistic, but I think there's value in experimenting with these utopian concepts, even if they don't solve every problem perfectly. What do you think - can democratic self-governance actually lead to self-correction, or am I being too optimistic about human nature? reply",

You can try YC co founder matching but that’s also filled with incompetent people at best or toxic snakes at worst who will waste your time end of the day, especially if you have made progress already. Your best best (if you’re serious and not just a fan of calling yourself a FOUNDER) is to just learn, build, and sell. Learn what you don’t know. Build what you can. You need to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Your cofounder is probably burning out at a golden handcuffs job and might see your progress and want to join. Don’t waste your time or worse equity (yes 1yr cliff and vesting, but still you’ll meet complete idiots who don’t understand anything who just waste your time) on randoms who are probably 5% as passionate about the problem you’re trying to solve. Hire people if you need. There are loads of people who are open to work right now and you can hire them on fixed contract. reply",

          "text": "I’m open to discuss here if that’s okay. If it can also help others who are in similar boat. Biggest advice I can offer is that if YOU are building something you have the most to gain, and also lose. You give a shit, that’s why you are doing it. The 50/50 equity split works for college students who want to do a startup. Don’t bother with MBAs, people who dress up as Steve Jobs, and people who have done only sales (add them on LinkedIn for their connections). IMO if you’re a solo technical founder you should give yourself 60% (leave 40% unallocated). Until you find the right co-founder or early employee, you should own 100% of your company. Keep building the IP, keep networking, and push through the negative signals (there will be many). You should add as many people on LinkedIn as you can. Add other founders, people who can be your potential customers, and anyone in the middle who has 500+ connections. Go through those connections of theirs and keep messaging and adding people. Warm up to them (takes time), don’t be pushy/salesy, and you’ll do well. Also join any communities (slack, discord, forums, etc) that have your potential customers. Warm up there, hop in and add to off topic and such channels so the regulars get to know you. Then, when you do start pitching you won’t get banned lol. At worst you will probably burn through the first few dozen as you figure out what works and doesn’t. Thankfully there are billions of people and probably hundreds of thousands or millions potential people who will talk to you. reply",

The main plus compared to traditional systems is that a drone can cover an enormous surface in a short time compared to static systems or man-portable insecticide spraying.

Wasps have a very wide-band doppler echo – their relatively long and thin wings are moving slower at the roots than at the tips. Flies, on the other hand, have stubbier wings, and emit a tighter echo signal. The mosquito signal is even tighter. Fascinating engineering! Doesn't seem like it would be possible but it apparently is. There's also more visuals at about 17 minutes in the video embedded in that article, the signatures seem fairly distinct. reply",

Their Do It Yourself kit is a simple Vibram sole I can cut to size, a hole punch to find the right fit, and a long lace that I can tie in many different ways, including as a slipper, or sandal, or greek-style laced-up huarache. Tie style, with different colour combinations of sole and lace make for distinctive personalisation. Your stuff takes it to a whole other level. It makes me imagine a constructible footwear that can morph from a flip-flop (band across foot) all the way up to an all-weather knee-length boot. No doubt you have already imagined how experimentation with materials and sealing/binding techniques could yield a design system that everyone can make their own; from the multi-spectral La Sape , to baby wear for those fast-growth years, to field equipment for the extreme adventurer.

You don't have to make all design decisions beforehand, but can wear something for a while and then make changes based on your needs & observations. I haven't quite figured out how to apply this thinking to seam sealing though. The current garments that have taped / waterproof seams are locked into the taped configuration.

Caching will likely be fairly tuned toward the operation itself, since it's not a general-purpose DBMS and I can fairly accurately predict which pages will likely be useful to cache or when read-ahead is likely to be fruitful based on the operation being performed. For keyword-document mappings some LRU cache scheme is likely a good fit, when reading a list of documents readahead is good (and I can inform the pool of how far to read ahead), when intersecting document lists I can also generally predict when pages are likely to be re-read or needed in the future based on the  position in the tree. Will definitely need a fair bit of tuning but overall the problem is greatly simplified by revolving around very specific types of access patterns. reply",

Not sure why.  Work uses BT to distribute customized Debian images, though as far as I can tell none of these images have copyrighted material in them.  Maybe my ISP is telling CloudFlare I'm a bad person me 'cause it sees BT and doesn't care that it can't find evidence of copyright infringement?<p>So about half the time, the CloudFlare dashboard is blocked with a message saying I should email the site I'm trying to reach and get them to unblock me.  But it's CloudFlare I'm trying to reach and their support people don't respond (even if I try to email them.)<p>I mean... I guess it's time to move to Akamai.  But CloudFlare's still poisoned my IP.<p>Also... seems like if a CDN is going to block access to a site's data and say \"email the site to get access restored\" they would have an email address you can use to do that.  If I have to go to the web site to find out what the email address I have to send a message to and that site is blocked...<p>Am I supposed to pay CloudFlare for the privilege of not being blocked by people who use their service?  Has it become a protection racket?<p>Anyway... if anyone knows how to get ahold of CloudFlare support, maybe by phone(?), that would be appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I don't know if it's cause some support person saw John's request or if it was just a random thing that fixed itself.  But if say... one third of the top 1000 web sites are behind CloudFlare and CloudFlare only has five-nines, that probably means tens of thousands of people are getting false positives every day. I understand wanting to defend against bad guys, but if there's no way to contact CloudFlare support because CloudFlare blocked you from contacting their support... Though... yeah... I was able to get in to the support portal on my mobile phone.  There's got to be a better way.

I'm on a smaller ISP and I wonder if their AS got blackmarks for not sufficiently blocking spammers or botnets. And if this happens to you, be sure to record as much data as you can.  I sort of spaced and didn't record the Ray ID on the error page.  I think that would have helped a great deal in debugging the problem. And yes... their AI generated response is sort of horrible, but... well... it's an automated response.  I'm not going to ding CF for that.  Everyone's automated responses are horrible. I went into this wanting to be uncharitable to CF, but they seem to be taking it serious, so kudos to them. [Edit.  Lol - didn't look close enough.  I think dknecht is the current CTO.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.<p>But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.<p>After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.<p>After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.<p>When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.<p>Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.<p>Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.<p>Should I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Coding has nothing to do with degrees. It's actually a huge waste of time. Unless you are studying to be a doctor or a lawyer, school is waste of time and money and has huge opportunity costs. So definitely do not even think about masters. I have started fiddling with HTML around 2000, PHP in 2004, then Go in 2018-ish. I always worked with websites, though thanks to Go, nowadays it is mostly backend related and lower level stuff. Anyway, I say this as I have seen the market develop for quarter of a century. And what you are experiencing is simply saturated market. Everyone thinks they can write code nowadays and so there is too much supply. Then add the the \"AI\" crap and you find yourself very quickly being obsolete. The real economy is tanking, despite fake numbers propping up the stock market, one just needs to glance at massive tech layoffs since 2022 to realise the time is up. So not a good time to be a newbie in this field. But is that really so? No, absolutely not. My whole \"career\", I worked in niches and that always paid my bills. And I always recommend the same. Don't be a generalist, specialise on something unique where there is little competition and sufficient demand and stability. It can be absolutely anything imaginable, just make sure you become an expert in this niche. This will then allow you to easily filter out job advertisements so you can focus on jobs where you will have high chance of being a fit for and also experience little competition, comparatively to the rest of the job market. Last tip, focus on the east, not on the dying west. The future is in China when it comes to tech. There is competition, but again, keyword is \"niche\". And the job market is there and will be there. As you are in Iraq, that poses quite a problem, even for remote work. So you might be forced to look for middle eastern countries with tech jobs. I guess UAE would be my pick as from what I hear the salaries are great and supply is low, mostly because nobody wants to move there. Also you would have no time zone issues for remote work. Either way, you have to think in the context of your situation in general and make decisions based on your capabilities and options. reply",

          "text": "I don’t want to sound discouraging, but I’ll be honest. First of all, you need to figure out what you really want  and what you’re willing to do to get there. Some people mentioned starting your own project above. I think that’s a really great path. I was in a similar situation: I started learning programming about five years ago. I don’t have a technical background at all — I’m actually a humanities student. I didn’t choose programming because it was trendy. I chose it because something inside me said, “This is my path.” At the time, I lost my job. I had several children to take care of. It was a tough time, but I kept learning every day - step by step. And now? I create things. Not for money yet - for craftsmanship, for freedom, for the future. And little by little, doors are opening. That’s why I say: follow your heart, but don’t forget about your mind. No problem is unsolvable. Sometimes the road is long. But it’s still a road. reply",
