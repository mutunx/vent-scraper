      "title": "Ask HN: Quality of recent gens of Dell/Lenovo laptops worse than 10 years ago?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Couple of reasons - the first is that there is a price premium which I cannot seem to justify and second is the teething / niggling issues which I have had to face in pretty much every Dell I have owned. Sometime, it will be too long a time to wake up from sleep or a random crash which requires me to fetch bitlocker key from my account so that I can boot it up again to driver update issues to the fan continuously running for no reason etc. I had, by chance, a good experience with Acer in the past and since then have purchased a couple fo them more and the experience has been seamless and pleasant. I do hope Dell ups its game as it was an iconic and innovative brand but there is less now to differentiate it from competition and so no reason for the premium to be charged. reply",

I'd argue my case even if I had not purchased Dell Care. But still, failing in a couple of years is really unacceptable. I was thinking 5 years for the battery and another 5 years for everything else. If you and me have to spend some $2,000 every 3-4 years it sounds more like a subscription service.

The best experiences I've had with Dell hardware have been mid though... worse with HP, won'y buy their stuff at all any more. I've had mixed to very good experiences with Lenovo...

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

But tech progressed and we started noticing that he was having trouble hearing \"s\" sounds. I researched and got him the Oticon Real and it's been amazing and his speech dramatically improved with the new tech. There have been a lot fewer problems with wind noise and he can talk and pay attention in loud environments like school or a restaurant. His grades shot up. The newer tech is definitely worth it but spendy. There are times though when I'm a bit jealous, too!  He can turn them off when he doesn't want to hear and can listen to anything on his phone over bluetooth, as well as take calls. And he never wakes up at night because of noise :) reply",

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "Let’s try some actual numbers. A fancy passive IEM quotes: > Sensitivity: 114 dB-SPL (@ 0.1V) That’s on the high side for an IEM.  Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

But considering the kind of hardware they most likely are using, how is the captioning actually happening? I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these. Edit: I realize now this product is not at all for people like me, \"Boost caption accuracy up to 98%\" and \"More accurate translations\" are locked behind a $15/month subscription, kind of disgusting how they hide making the product work as it should behind a subscription. I just want some simple glasses that can caption what people are saying without ripping me off, I guess we're too late into capitalism for that to actually be made for consumer. reply",

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

Essentially I have filtering issues, as soon as multiple people talk, I can’t really understand anyone anymore, unless they very directly speak into my ears so they are significantly louder than other noises. It’s a brain thing, my hearing itself is above average for my age (40), so I’m not sure what exactly can be done, but there was an article many years ago about someone (Bose?) working on aids for that issue, no idea what came of it. I guess all modern hearing aids have some focus mode.

You use half a dozen microphone transducers (minimum; Crappy microphone transducers are cheap and quality is expensive, so just use a bunch of them), and through a combination of phase and intensity they decode relative location, and amplify that phase expectation while suppressing everything that isn't phased like that. Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

I currently have Oticon Opn1’s and have had Oticons since 2017 (and got new ones in 2022) and they are fabulous. I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

I tried Phonaks and found that the use of Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone was painfully flakey (there were certain locations in my neighborhood that every time I walked in front of a particular house, I would lose audio). I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

Oticon just announced/released their 'Zeal' product - a non-custom CIC, with seemingly all the bells and whistles, including bluetooth.\nPlanning to try them soon. I have tried a few aids before (Starkey and some older Phonak) and I do really like the Oticon 'sound'. They work for me, but of course YMMV. I think many aid manufacturers (many of them the same company - WDH!) do 60 day trials. Worth a shot. My only dislike is the new fad, particularly of Oticon, of stopping disposable batteries and only going rechargeable.\nDisposable zinc-air cells have great life (I'd get a week on the Opns at least, with a few hours streaming per day). I travel for work a lot, so carrying a couple of tiny 312's in my wallet or keychain was perfect.\nThe Zeal look to have what Oticon think is a 'compact' charger - but it ain't small.\nMy kingdom for a charger the size of the AirPods Pro case... reply",

          "text": "I tried Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Amazon was confusing, not intuitive and because of hidden dashboards i had a running service that cost me money that i did not know about. Microsoft Azure was also very confusing and I don't think I was even able to use it because I had no clue how. Google had the best dashboard and I never had issue with anything, despite it lacking in offering(back then). In the end, I ditched all cloud providers and went to standard VPS providers because cloud is good to get you going when you might need elasticity for unknown growth. Buts after that, it makes no financial sense and is a huge vendor lock-in trap. PS and no, companies that provide VPS hosting are not \"cloud\". reply",

You'd have to be more specific about what you actually want to do before someone could give you a more informed take than that. I've built out at least one nontrivial thing on all of the major names and many of the lesser known ones by this point and I'm likely to continue to just because infra is fun :) From a position of zero knowledge otherwise, I would probably default to Azure just because I have a lot of faith in it being able to drive enterprise workloads while staying compliant with whatever regulations exist under the sun. If I find out that more or less we don't care about that I then pass the torch to AWS because they tend to have a slight pride advantage. If I find out yet more information, like e.g. the client prefers running everything on VMs they themselves control, I might look into Hetzner, etc. Cloudflare for very specific egress or serverless needs... But you can see it really all depends on the project, and if you don't know any better you might as well just pick one of the big three at random and go for it. reply",

My point is really that if transactions are taking minutes to complete, that's likely to be a social/structural problem, not a technical one. With today's technology and all the work in this space, it's not particularly technically difficult to get such times down into the seconds or milliseconds, depending on the constraints. Yes, HFT has gone to extremes to get trade execution times down as low as microseconds. And sure, that involves technical challenges.

There are plenty of financial systems that takes days or weeks to fully process transactions.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

There are insanely dirty hacks that you could do to start controlling the fallout of the page faults (like playing games with userfaultfd), but they're unmaintainable in the long term as they introduce a fragility that results in unexpected complexity at the worst possible times (bugs).  Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings. Having been a kernel developer for a long time makes it a lot easier to spot what will work well for applications versus what can be considered glass jaws. reply",

          "text": "This is where having a little bit of swap can help you out. Not because you need swap, but because swap use % and swap I/O rates are good indicators. Something like 512 MB to maybe 1 G; not something like 2x your memory (unless you're on a very small system, and then use min(2x memory, 512 MB); having too much swap extends the amount of time your system can be swapping to death before it actually dies. If your swap use jumps 10 points in a small time frame, you are running out of memory quickly. If your swap use hits 50 % or 80% or [whatever threshold], without any big jumps you're running out of memory slowly. If your swap I/O is all output, not a huge deal... you're swapping stuff you never read. If you've got a lot of swapping in, chances are you're swapping to death. > The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. I'm a big fan of straight up even distribution of requests. It's simple and predictable, although it's not going to get you the best throughput, predictability and simplicity is often better than perfection. If you always send each node 1/Nth of requests, worst case of a node that is broken but looks up is that you're still sending it a share when it should get nothing; if you have some sort of utilization based metric, if it looks underutilized because it's just dropping requests and responding with success but empty, it sucks up all your requests. Alternatively, people have good results with select M nodes by metrics, and then random selection between those. But also, IMHO, you want to reduce the work your load balancer(s) do, because load balancing load balancers is hard. reply",

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

          "text": "It's not clear whether you're using Kubernetes, but the Kubernetes way of dealing with this problem is to declare a memory reservation (i.e., a request) along with the container specification. The amount of the reservation will be deducted from the host's available memory for scheduling purposes, regardless of whether the container actually consumes the reserved amount. It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer. Of course, for this to work, you have to figure out what that reserved amount should be. That is an exercise for the implementer (i.e., you). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-res... >  Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap. Yeah, don't do that.

We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. A few things come to mind... First, you're talking about a load balancer, but it's not clear that you're trying to balance load! A good metric to use for load balancing is one whose value is proportional to response latency. It smells like you're trying to provision resources based on an optimistic prediction of your working set size. Perhaps you need a more pessimistic prediction. It might also be that you're relying too heavily on the kernel to handle paging, when what you really need is a cache tuned for your application that is scan-resistant, coupled with O_DIRECT for I/O. reply",

          "text": "It might have a minor beneficial impact to tourism in Saint Barthelemy and Norfolk Island from geeks wanting a trendy new account registered in a territory with fewer than 1000 IPv4 addresses allocated.[1] A more useful addition would be a contributions calendar similar to GitHub's [2] but focused on which time zones the user is active within, and importantly, the latency of the user's replies. It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

Seemingly, it's the same kind of misalignment that makes people loudly complain when political threads get flagged and killed. This site is specifically a salon where a bunch of pseudonymous \"too smart\" nerds opine about topics that stimulate their curiosity, following guidelines on best-intent and good-faith that are essentially debate rules. Sometimes, amidst those discussions, you'll witness seemingly personal anecdotes or seemingly insider insights, which you should always be taking as a grain of salt, used only to drive (or repel) your own curiosity and desire for more discussion and debate. It's not a great place for earnest politics, activism, or anything so serious and existential. And because it doesn't aim to be, it doesn't beg for disclosures like location. As long as you can \"talk the talk\" here, and follow the guidelines, you're welcome to participate in the discussion how you'd like, without being measured by your person, its history, or its geography. Its great to have a place like that online. reply",

Post history for each account is already visible, so if you have an agenda, it sticks out like a sore thumb there. Moderation: Won't meaningfully impact moderation. HN can already see this info and they are the ones that take moderator action. It may hurt moderation/increase moderation costs because people may tend more to report content based on country instead of content. Transparency: Outright influencer content (political or corporate) doesn't make it to the front page enough for it to matter, or if it does, I can't tell. Anti-abuse: Same as moderation. Abuse reports should be processed based on content and not country of origin. Meaningfully improves discussion quality: If a story is about something happening in a particular country, people who look like they are from that country might get asked more or different questions. This puts people from that country on the spot. They may get increased unsolicited communication or thread hijacks. Right now, if someone wants to be on that spot, they can voluntarily identify, either in the profile or in the post. Possibly something useful would be a rule/requirement that claiming to be from a country different than the one you made an account from--seen either in a profile or post--requires verification for further posting, but if you never make such a contrary claim, the verification is not needed. reply",
