The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects.  The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine.  It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files.  I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

It's an open-source form submissions forwarder. I built it mostly because I wanted a service thats transparent, with usage based pricing that I could use economically for my low traffick sites.

Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery. reply",

Most companies have nuclear engineers like me who picked up some software skills along the way, but I've found it's always a huge benefit to bring in some nuclear-interested SWEs to help get things running with best practices. Some SWEs I've hired in the past felt a little isolated, but others have engaged well with the nuclear and mechanical engineers and had a great time.

          "text": "On my free time I've been making a small \"game\" where you control a spacecraft using a 6502 computer. You can control things like thrusters, antennas and read data from star sensors, gyros, etc. using memory mapped I/O directly and you can't control anything directly. The whole thing works pretty well, it's built using Godot & a custom Rust extension with the 6502 emulator & assembler. It can even be exported to the web so you can write your code using a CodeMirror editor and send it to the game in the browser. Now, as expected, the hard part is making it fun. Just giving players an empty code editor and a manual for the sensors/actuators doesn't seem great, and there's also no goal for now. I'd like to take inspiration from Shenzhen I/O to build a sense of progression by tackling more and more difficult control challenges maybe? It also supports running multiple computers at once so I think there's some fun potential for a \"multiplayer\" mode where you try to achieve some objective (scanning X, mining Y) against other players by sending spacecrafts with your code on them and all the crafts would run on one server. Anyway I'm curious if people would be interested in such a game! reply",

          "text": "Thanks! The answer is neither; it isn't remotely imitating the Lisa's architecture, nor is it a skin over some other previously written JS code. To be clear: this is absolutely NOT a CSS skin. The only CSS involved is used for the positioning of the canvas element on the page, and for the styling of the temporary UI elements which mimic the Lisa's hardware test screen (and those that display as a fallback if JS is disabled). When the system \"boots\" all those temporary elements are replaced with a single canvas element on which the UI is displayed. I should perhaps have been less modest in my original comment in that all of the UI components are coded from scratch. This includes a hierarchical system for displaying objects on the canvas (not dissimilar to the the DOM), the windowing system, a typesetting system, multiple systems for displaying and storing image data, and much more. I've written what I hesitate to call a graphics engine, but I guess that's sort of what it is... it even supports 1-bit blending modes. This was originally going to be more along the lines of a CSS skin, but I became so deeply frustrated with visual inconsistencies across browser engines and platforms that I ultimately decided to move all the logic I could into JS. The result is what you see now. reply",

I imagine there are lots of people who have the talent and creativity to create a multiplayer game but don't have the interest or patience in learning how to code multiplayer, and so that's who this is for!

          "text": "To be honest, that's kind of why I'm here posting about it. I think https://gatew.easel.games is impressive, but I also know the engine is capable of so much more than what people have made with it so far, and I'm trying to find people who have dreams but haven't found the right tool yet so I can build that for them. The pricing model and how to run Easel sustainably is a huge question. Easel is basically a free product, which is what I want because (a) I would just like people to use it and (b) multiplayer games need lots of players. I made the upfront decision to never run ads on Easel because I want parents and schools to be happy with it being used by their teenagers, and that has greatly changed the business dynamics. I have very delicately managed the cost-efficiency of Easel only expecting about 1% of people to ever subscribe to Easel+. For this reason, I've avoided expensive features so that one dedicated server can run at least 1 million projects and handle thousands of concurrent players at a manageable cost. It's been a real slimming exercise. I know the catalogue is small, but despite that, there are some people who come back and play one game every single day on Easel. There are also people who come back and make games every day on Easel. And there are some who do both. We have people exceeding 100+ hours a month sometimes. It's these people who Easel+ is for. Easel+ is designed as a package deal with a bunch of different game-playing and game-making perks so that people can decide for themselves what parts of the package they find valuable. But I would honestly be happy to have thousands of people using it and not paying a cent. This is my life's work and I just want it to be used, even if I have to fund it all myself. reply",

          "text": "Yes, in the end I just made this decision pragmatically and it's not a grand statement about how I think programming languages should work. I felt that it would be possible to add gradual typing to Easel eventually, and so chose to prioritise other programming language features. One of the original \"agitators\" which caused me to make Easel was because I was so surprised at how popular the modding tools for my previous game were with first-time coders. The modding tools used JSON, which might sound primitive, but if you look past the JSON it was actually defining a hierarchical declarative language for defining game behaviour. I have many theories for why first-time coders could just pick it up, but one of them is I think the hierarchical shape meant everything could be written inline, without indirection or jumping around. This format allowed all these gamers to just accidentally fall into coding and it was quite impressive how far they got without any help. But those old modding tools were quite limited really, and that limited how much coding people could learn. So for years I just kept wondering what would happen if someone made that magic hierarchical declarative shape unlimited by merging it with a traditional imperative programming language. Would it allow gamers to accidentally fall into learning actual coding? It took me about 2 years to squash together these two seemingly-opposed paradigms and make the Easel programming language. Doing this required slimming down on the other language features in order to iterate quickly on this big problem, so that's how we ended up not having strong typing, amongst other things. But I don't regret what I chose to prioritise, and I hope to address this in the coming years! reply",

          "text": "LLMs give you superpowers if you work on a wide range of tasks and aren't a deep expert on all of them.  They aren't that great if you know the area you are working in inside and out and never stray from it. For example, using an LLM to help you write a Dockerfile when you write Dockerfiles once a project and don't have a dedicated expert like a Deployment Engineer in your company is fantastic. Or using an LLM to get answers faster than google for syntax errors and other minor issues is nice. Even using LLM with careful prompting to discuss architecture tradeoffs and get its analysis (but make the final decision yourself) can be helpful. Generally, you want to be very careful about how you constrain the LLM through prompts to ensure you keep it on a very narrow path so that it doesn't do something stupid (as LLMs are prone to do), you also often have to iterate because LLMs will occasionally do things like hallucinate APIs that don't actually exist.  But even with iteration it can often make you faster. reply",

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

It gets stuck in loops (removing and adding the same code/concept), it gets hung up on simple errors, etc. For greenfield it’s amazing, no doubt, but unless you are watching it very closely and approving/reviewing the code along the way it will go off the rails. At a certain point it’s easier to add the new feature or make the modification yourself. Even if the LLM could do it, it would burn tons of money and time. I expect things to get better, this will not always be the state of things, but for now “vibe coding” (specifically not reviewing/writing code yourself) is not sustainable. Most people doing it have a github profile that is a mile wide and a meter deep. LLM’s are amazing and useful, but “vibe coding” with them is not sustainable currently. reply",

Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code.

LLM doesn’t have a standardized directory structure, so you end up with different projects having different structures and file naming conventions. This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

I'm absolutely convinced that people who say LLMs are not making them more productive either don't understand how to use them correctly, or they are working on very specific niche problems/infrastructure where they aren't useful. 2x may not sound like much compared to what you read in the media, but if a few years ago you had told companies that you can provably make their engineers even 2x more productive on average you'd probably be swimming in billions of dollars now. That kind of productivity increase is absolutely huge. reply",

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often. Before quality search engines like Google, this meant I was always flipping through reference books, man pages, and worse. Then came search engines and that was a step more productive. Then came things like SO, and that was a step more productive. I find LLMs to be another step forward, but not like a quantum leap or anything. Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch.

This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs.

          "text": "I'm learning math through Math Academy, ChatGPT and YouTube (mostly 3Blue1Brown and similar channels). Without that specifc combination, it would've been hell. Now it's just nice. A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

          "text": "Is it? I didn't bother to check as it wasn't too relevant. I wasn't stuck anymore. Worst-case it's a memnonic that is untrue. Best case: it is. For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

Let's face it \"prompt engineering\" is a synonym for \"I have to waste time coming up with hacky workarounds to make this dumb LLM come up with something usable\". In the end, its always quicker and easier to do it myself.  And unless you are fresh out of school, if you've got more than 10 minutes of coding experience, you will always do a better job than the LLM. Every time a new LLM model comes out, I fall into the same old trap \"oh well, this one must be better, surely\" I say to myself. And yet its always the same \"you can't polish a turd but you can roll it in glitter\" experience. I'm sick and tired of LLMs hallucinating shit. I'm sick and tired of LLMs inventing functions that have been available in stdlib for years. I'm sick and tired of LLMs generating useless code with boilerplate subfunctions that just contain a single commented \"implement it yourself\" line. On top of that LLMs are simply terrible for the environment, guzzling up all that electricity, producing nothing but hot air and bullshit results in return.

And then there’s the middle group, people quietly getting real, uneven, but worthwhile value. You’d be surprised. The vast majority of engineering isn’t that unique. Usefulness often depends on the age of the codebase and the dynamics of the team. I’m firmly in the middle camp: far from perfect, but I get real value from these tools as they stand today.

I use a wide variety of tools. For more private or personal tasks, I mostly rely on Claude and OpenAI; sometimes I also use Google or Perplexity—whichever gives the best results. For business purposes, I either use Copilot within VSCode or, via an internal corporate platform, Claude, OpenAI, and Google. I’ve also experimented a bit with Copilot Studio. I’ve been working like this for about a year and a half now, though I haven’t had access to every tool the entire time. So far, I can say this: Yes, LLMs have increased my productivity. I’m experimenting with different programming languages, which is quite fun. I’m gaining a better understanding of various topics, and that definitely makes some things easier. But—regardless of the model or its version—I also find myself getting really, really frustrated. The more complex the task, the more I step outside of well-trodden paths, and the more it's not just about piecing together simple components… the more they all tend to fail. And if that’s not enough: in some cases, I’d even say it takes more time to fix the mess an LLM makes than it ever saved me in the first place. Right now, my honest conclusion is this:\nLLMs are useful for small code completion tasks, troubleshooting and explaining —but that’s about it. They’re not taking our jobs anytime soon. reply",

In my experience, LLMs are way more useful for coding and less problem-prone when you use them without exaggerated expectations and understand that it was trained on buggy code, and that of course it is going to generate buggy code. Because almost all code is buggy. Don't delegate design for it, use functional decomposition, do your homework and then use LLMs to eliminate toil, to deal with the boring stuff, to guide you on unfamiliar territory. But LLMs don't eliminate the need for you to understand the code that goes with your name. And usually, if you think a piece of LLM generated code is perfect, remember that maybe the defects are there, but you need to improve your own knowledge and skills to find it.

          "text": "Basically yes, once the \"problem\" gets too big, the LLM stops being useful. As you say, it's great for automating away boring things; as a more complicated search & replace, for instance.  Or, \"Implement methods so that it satisfies this interface\", where the methods are pretty obvious.  Or even \"Fill out stub CRUD operations for this set of resources in the API\". I've recently started asking Claude Opus 4 to review my patches when I'm done, and it's occasionally caught errors, and sometimes has been good at prompting me to do something I know I really should be doing. But once you get past a certain complexity level -- which isn't really that far - it just stops being useful. For one thing, the changes which need to be made often span multiple files, each of which is fairly large; so I try to think carefully about which files would need to be touched to make a change; after which point I find I have an idea what needs to be changed anyway. That said, using the AI like a \"rubber duck\" programmer isn't necessarily bad.  Basically, I ask it to make a change; if it makes it and it's good, great!  If it's a bit random, I just take over and do it myself.  I've only wasted the time of reviewing the LLM's very first change, as nearly everything else I'd've had to do if I wrote the patch myself from scratch anyway. Furthermore, I often find it much easier to take a framework that's mostly in the right direction and modify it the way that I want, than to code up everything from scratch.  So if I say, \"Implement this\", and then end up modifying nearly everything, it still seems like less effort than starting from scratch myself. The key thing is that I don't work hard at trying to make the LLM do something it's clearly having trouble with.  Sometimes the specification was unclear and it made a reasonable assumption; but if I tell it to do something and it's still having trouble, I just finish the task myself. reply",

It can then give me approximate code that I will probably need to modify a fair bit, but that I can use as the basis for my work. Having an LLM code a preliminary solution is often more efficient than jumping to reading the docs immediately. I do usually need to read the docs, but by the time I look at them, I already know what I need to look up and have a feasible approach in my head. If I know exactly how I would build something, an LLM isn't as useful, although I will admit that sometimes an LLM will come up with a clever algorithm that I wouldn't have thought up on my own. I think that, for everyone who has been an engineer for some time, we already have a way that we write code, and LLMs are a departure.

The actual writing of the code is never the hard part or time-consuming part for me - it's figuring out the right architecture, figuring out how to properly refactor someone else's hairball, finding performance issues, debugging rare bugs, etc. Yes, LLMs accelerate the process of writing the boilerplate, but unless you're building brand new products from scratch every 2nd week, how much boilerplate are you really writing?

I find it completely falls over on a complete feature. I tried using aider and people seem to love it but it was just a disaster for me. I wanted to implement a fairly simple templated email feature in a Next.js app. The kind of thing that would take me about a day. This is one of the most typical development scenarios I can imagine. I described the feature in it's entirety and aider completely failed, not even close. So I started describing sub-features one by one and it seemed to work better. But as I added more and more, existing parts began to break, I explained the issues to aider and it just got worse and worse with every prompt.

I just need something that works, but I can still ask for code that can be maintained and expanded if needed. It finally clicked for me when I tried Gemini and ChatGPT side by side. I found that my style of working is more iterative than starting with a fully formed plan. Gemini did well on oneshots, but my lack of experience made the output messy. This made it clear to me that the more chatty ChatGPT was working for me since it seems to incorporate new stuff better. Great for those \"Oh, crap I didn't think of that\" moments that come up for inexperienced devs like me. With ChatGPT I use a modular approach. I first plan a high level concept with 03, then we consider best practices for each. After that I get best results with 4o and Canvas since that model doesn't seem to overthink and change direction as much. Granted, my creations are not pushing up against the limits of human knowledge, but I consistently get clean maintainable results this way. Recently I made a browser extension to show me local times when I hover over text on a website that shows an international time. It uses regex to find the text, and I would never have been able to crank this out myself without spending considerable time learning it. This weekend I made a Linux app to help rice a spare monitor so it shows scrolling cheat sheets to help me memorize stuff. This turned out so well, that I might put it up on GitHub.

Thus, my recommendation would be - try non-agentic tools. My primary workflow is something that works with the Zed editor, and which I later ported as a custom plugin to Goland. Basically, you first chat with the AI in a sidebar possibly embedding a couple of files in the discussion (so far nothing new), and then (this is the new part) you use contextual inline edits to rewrite code \"surgically\". Importantly, the inline edits have to be contextual, they need to know both  the content of the edited file, and of the conversation so far, so they will usually just have a prompt like \"implement what we discussed\". From all I know, only Zed's AI assistant supports this. With this I've had a lot of success. I still effectively make all architectural decisions, it just handles the nitty-gritty details, and with enough context in the chat from the current codebase (in my case usually tens of thousands of tokens worth of embedded files) it will also adhere very well to your code-style. reply",

I was still learning Java at uni (while being a Python/Lisp fanboy) when I realised this: - Complex and wordy languages need tooling (like autocomplete, autoformatting) to handle the tedious parts. - Simple and expressive languages can get away with coding in notepad.exe. - Lisp, as simple and powerful as it is, needs brace highlighting. You. Simply. Just. Can't. Now 10, 20 years later you can look back at the evolution of many of these languages; some trends I've observed: - Java, C#, C++, have all borrowed a lot from functional languages. - JVM has Clojure. - Go stubbornly insists on \"if err != nil\" - which isn't even the worst part; the following fmt.Errorf is. - Rust (post-1.0) cautiously moved towards \"?\"; Zig (still pre-1.0) also has specific syntax for errors. - Python is slowly getting more verbose, mostly because of type annotations. - Autoformatters are actually great, you don't even have to care about indenting code as you spit it out, but... Python, being whitespace-sensitive, makes them a bit less useful. Good tooling helps you with wordy languages. Expressive languages help you write concise code. Code is read much more often than it's written. Deterministic tooling can work with the structure of the code, but LMs (being probabilistic) can help you work with its intent . Language models are an evolution of automated tooling - they will get better, just like autocomplete got better; but they will never \"solve\" coding.

          "text": "Nope, at least Claude code is very useful IME. Great for annoying ad-hoc programming where the objective is clear but I lack the time or motivation to do it. Example: After benchmarking an application on various combinations of OS/arch platforms, I wanted to turn the barely structured notes into nice graphs. Claude Code easily generated Python code that used a cursed regex parser to extract the raw data and turned it into a bunch of grouped bar charts via matplotlib. Took just a couple minutes and it didn't make a single mistake. Fantastic time saver! This is just an ad-hoc script. No need to extend or maintain it for eternity. It has served its purpose and if the input data will change, I can just throw it away and generate a new script. But if Claude hadn't done it, the graphs simply wouldn't exist. Update: Sorry, missed \"writing self-contained throwaway pieces of code\"... well for core development I too haven't really used it. reply",

Particularly, with data structures it is garbage: it nevers understands the constrains that justify writing a new one instead of relying on the ones from the standard library. And finally, it is incapable of understanding changes of mind. It will go back to stufd already discarted or replaced. The worst part of all is that it insists in introducing its own \"contributions\". For example, recently I have been doing some work on ML and I wanted to see the effect of some ablations. It destroyed my code to add again all the stuff I had removed on purpose. Overall, it provides small typing/search savings, but it cannot be trusted at all yet. reply",

A muddied or insufficient context can sometimes degrade performance by a whole model generation, ime. What works for me is collecting it manually and going one implementation chunk at a time. If it fails, I either do it myself or break it down into smaller chunks. As models got better these chunks got larger and larger. Collecting context manually forces me to really consider what information is necessary to solve the problem, and it's much easier to then jump in to fix issues or break it down compared to sending it off blind. It also makes it a lot faster, since I shortcircuit the context collection step and it's easier to course-correct it. Collecting manually is about 10 seconds of work as I have an extension that copies all files I have opened to the clipboard. reply",

The podcast is a short-format that explains the problem, the tool as a solution and some side notes. Example: \"File renaming is annoying and complicated. Then I found the `renameutils` package and from that i use qmv. It opens your favourite editor with the names of all files you want to rename. Once you are done with the modifications, you close the editor and the files are renamed. That's it! Enjoy!\" I actually started it as I just LOVE cli tools and want to spread some love for them. Also I love telling people about them and so many people were thankful for the hints and later-on told me \"oh that tool saved me so much time! i love it.\" And the podcast is just the idea to spread the knowledge of those tools reply",

          "text": "Since you already work as an automation engineer, it might be a bit harder since programming is probably part of your job, but this is what I did at a previous company:\nI wrote up a contract basically saying that since programming large programs was outside the scope of my normal work, any such programs I wrote would not be considered \"works for hire\" (a legal term in the US) and not property of the company, but instead my own property that I could sell elsewhere if I wanted.  I was specifically allowed to use company resources to develop the software (including reasonable time my manager signed off on) and in return the company would get a non-exclusive perpetual right to use and modify the software as they saw fit. This contract was a win-win.  My company got the features they wanted as part of my normal employment, but I also got to keep the idea and monetize it outside the company if I wanted to.  The company didn't need to worry about licensing if I left since I granted a perpetual right to use/modify. Unfortunately for various reasons the project never got completed and I never monotized it, so I can't tell you the real-world outcome, but I do know we were all happy with the terms going into it. reply",

          "text": "Mentioning that you negotiated to keep your code from falling under \"works for hire\" does a lot of heavy lifting in this (very well packed) example. I recommend that the OP dig into what \"works for hire\" means in the US to get a sense of what they should negotiate [to avoid]. It can definitely be a win/win for the company as well as for an enterprising engineer. The general idea is simply to go outside the scope of your contract and do something the company didn't ask for, in exchange for a bit of money and the right to reuse whatever code you developed for them. Avoiding works for hire contracts is how I built a 25 year war chest of reusable components and frameworks, each piece commissioned to an individual task but each used and modified in my next jobs for my next clients, until many versions later I would update my original clients with them. My advice to OP is to always present your ideas to owners or managers with open ears, and explain how it will help the company. Secondly, never do the work for free. Thirdly, always retain your rights to your ideas and your code when you're working on something creative. If they have a problem with that you can also explain that it's unlikely anyone else will either fill this niche to save them money or that any competitor will ever actually know about or use what you will build for them, but that having it at your disposal is a way for you to continue increasing their efficiency (which is true). It's also a way to make them beholden to you at very little initial cost. reply",

Formalizing the idea while employed and then taking it outside could be trouble.  Probably worth discussing details with a lawyer before attempting.

          "text": "Quick suggestion: maybe contact the vendor company and offer to create a frontend for them instead as a contract thing? --- I've gone through the exact scenarion in your question though, this is roughly the path I took (Estonia & EU, YMMV in other jurisdictions): - start by going over your contract - is this overall even allowed? Some companies capture all IP you create 24/7, in this case you'll need to get the contract changed or get an exception - even if your contract allows doing other work (creating separate IP) outside of company time, still ask for written permission from your manager and possibly a skip level or two. I got a written email from my VP of eng and CTO before proceeding. - you will probably need to _completely_ separate your own work from the company work. This means using your personal laptop, never working on this during work hours, etc. Separating this sometimes can be hard, especially if you get something like a bug report from your employer - you can't work with it until you're off the clock. - I also completely cut myself off from the purchasing decision - I let them know I was working on a project, gave them a landing page and let the purchasing team do a decision completely on their own - if you hope to build a business out of this it's best to be upfront about it, e.g. by telling your manager that you might leave to focus on the business full-time if it takes off All of this assumes you're on good terms with your employer overall. reply",

For example, instead of buying your product the execs could fire you and hire someone else to do this internally. I see only three ways you might wing it: 1. Talk to your execs (ideally, the CEO) directly and sell this. On failure, be prepared to work on this internally. If so, ask for more money/promotion, which may not work but will not hurt either. 2. Call the other company and offer to improve their product for more money/promotion. 3. Get a techie friend to front for you: he approaches your company, you do the work, he shares the money. That's really grey area (being charitable). My 2c. reply",

Because the corporate answer is: \"Seeing and working on improving your organization is already part of your job. Talk to management and get a project rolling.\" Do it well, get promotions and raises. And then the entrepreneurial answer is to skip all that, go build it yourself, then sell it to many organizations. But you probably cannot do that as an employee, depending on your employment contract. So sure, the surface levels answers are to talk to a lawyer, your manager, etc. But the deeper answer is to decide on and commit to a direction - are you happy being an employee, or do you need to walk out and start your own thing? (And as a side note, don't build a startup that is a front-end to someone else's product. It may fill a need, but you are going to be spending all your hours keeping up with their changes, and ultimately your success is tied to their decisions and they could wipe you out just by spending a month improving their UX.) reply",

If it's something that's specific to your company and there is no market outside it, you have one customer that at the same time has strong leverage over you due to your current employment. If it's something that could be generally useful, you likely still don't have a market: if your product ever became popular, the big-name company selling the original software could add it as a feature or paid extension and would have a huge marketing advantage over you. The company you currently work for will likely not be willing to pay much for your work, and might take offense and fire you if you try to negotiate too hard. They could also decide that your new job is writing this thing... You could try to leverage it for a bonus or promotion or something like that. That's unlikely to capture a significant amount of the value you provide, but so are the other options. If you think the idea in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44080196 will fly, you could try that. I think it's unlikely to fly but it's the option that likely pays out best if it does fly, and if you approach it carefully (\"this is outside the scope of my role and my department, but I could do it in my free time\"), you might be able to pull it off with limited risk. You also need to understand how decision processes work at your company and optimize your proposal for it. If it's more work to get legal to approve the contract with you than to get approval to pay 10x as much to the original vendor to add something half as good as a feature, the vendor gets the job. reply",

          "text": "All decisions/actions have a “ceiling” and a “floor”, the best possible outcome and the worst. Let’s consider them for this situation. Ceiling - Company buys your software - You sell it to other companies - This becomes your full time job Floor - Fired - Trust lost, future advancement blocked (not saying it’s right, just that it could happen) Also important are how likely the outcomes are. Looking at the above and my own experience working at companies, having side projects, and selling them, I think you are much closer to the floor than the ceiling (in probability). Here are some hard truths: - Even if something is a win-win, many companies will not see it that way. They often react negatively to things they don’t understand or are uncommon. - Depending on where you work it might be impossible to develop a side project without the company owning the IP (sometimes you can get a special waiver but not if it has overlap with what your company does) - How capable are you of writing this software and are you really sure you have the problem/solution well understood? I don’t want to be rude but it sounds like you saw one presentation and think you can build and sell a solution that’s not spec’d out. I’m also not sure if your skill set, have you created software like this on your own before? - Just because people are enthusiastic about the prospect of this tool doesn’t mean they are willing to pay for it (or will even still be interested 1 day, 1 week, 1 month from now) - Developing software for a company (as an employee) and developing on your own are 2 different sets of skills. There is overlap, but it’s not the same - Sales/Marketing and running a business are a completely different set of skills. It’s rare to have a developer who can also do this well. Not impossible, just rare. - If you aren’t passionate about this then even if you are successful, you will not be happy. Employee? Work on whatever, no problem. Contractor? Work on whatever. Sole proprietor? Make sure it’s something you enjoy/care about. Maybe you do care about YAML file GUIs. At a minimum I would wait 2-4 weeks and gauge interest in the tool again. See if people are still super interested or if it’s “Huh? Oh yeah, ehh, it was just something that would be cool but we wouldn’t pay for it”. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, think everyone is as excited as you, then find out later they don’t care. Also use this time to see if the project still interests YOU. If, after all of this, you still want to pursue this then make sure to check your employment contract and even if there is nothing about side-projects/IP get _written_ approval from your manager. Lastly, ignore the people here suggesting you do anything “sneaky”, like the “I have a friend who is developing software that does this”. This is no way to live and those chickens will come home to roost. Either the company will catch you and/or you will be committing some kind of crime if you do obscure it. In all honesty there is a _very_ low chance that this is worth pursuing. I know personally how easy it can be to get caught up in an idea like this but the chances of it working out are low. Maybe in a better world they would be higher but I’ve seen enough to assume that the company will respond _poorly_ even to a well reasoned and mutually advantageous offer. It sucks, but that’s just the reality of most places. Even if your company is not like this, it still might be better for you to just pitch working on it internally and leverage a bonus/raise/title. reply",

          "text": "Depends on what you want to do. But my 2 cents are that like all new technology, LLMs will become a commodity. Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

          "text": "LLMs already are a commodity. Google has already kicked off the competitive price wars.  Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

It's actually pretty helpful for a SWE to understand them reasonably deeply, especially when they're so leaky as an abstraction (arguably, even the more nuanced characteristics of your database of choice will influence the design of your whole application).

We save a lot of manual time where we used to have to resolve unknown documents. The LLM can help fill out missing data, too. It's all stored as annotations so it's clear who/what edited the data. Granted this is a pretty simple task and a low stakes scenario, but I don't think we should limit ourselves to assuming AI will always only be dev tooling. reply",

Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy.

The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking.

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

There may also be some white collar jobs that will be safe longer due to regulatory reasons or whatever. Maybe get your physician's assistant license or something?

Currently people would tend to involve data scientists into this job, but data scientists are often less versed into the software engineering aspect, eg when they work more on notebooks than web apps.\nThe job is akin to being a web developer, so a \"normal\" developer but specialized in a certain field. Knowing the internals of LLMs is a big bonus, but you can start your journey with treating them as black box tools and still craft relevant solutions. You'll need to learn about running systems with databases (vector, graph, relational and nosql are all useful) and plugging multiple services together (docker, kubernetes, cloud hosting). reply",

          "text": "Maybe I'm too late to the party, but here are my 2 cents. AI/LLMs for web dev is like StackOverflow on steroids. Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

          "text": "> What kind of tasks you give Codex? Currently in the stage of evaluating Codex (mostly comparing it to Aider and my own homegrown LLM setup). I'm able to get changes out of it, that mostly make sense, but you really need to take whatever personal guidelines you have for coding and \"encode\" them into the AGENTS.md, and really focus on asking the right question/request changes in the right way. Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

The nature of day jobs is that even when your day job is doing something you love, you still resent it to some degree because it is a day job...the touring musician still has to ride in rented vans and stay in cheap hotels. Which is to say that all a day job needs to do is pay for rent and ramen and a good day job allows you to do the things that feed your soul in your time away from it. That's it. Good luck. reply",

The commit message ought to mention tradeoffs or alternative attempts. It may never happen, but post-mortem folks will want to have the assurance of thoughtfulness. That's true even if it's your own invention. You would want to note prior work. (If there aren't any or none was searched, you wouldn't have to cite anyway.) Likely though, implementors and adopters are interested in the design and references. The prompt doesn't necessarily need to be committed to source control, but it does bring up a question: if the prompt can reproduce the (company-owned) code diff, doesn't it need to be independently auditable as well? Same with local scripts. It's on the company machine, but it's not really as inspectable as on a remote branch. Does one default-share those? Some are truly experimental. That would depend on policy. (A major outage can influence policy.) It's easier if the prompt is on a company account; then only the link needs to be included, instead of a massive text file. reply",

          "text": "I think this type of question is, roughly, backwards. If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

          "text": "I've always been under the impression that if you make something truly useful or interesting, it will spread through word of mouth naturally and quickly. This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "This [0] comment and discussion under it about how non technical businesses are very rarely run by technical people, and how if you apply your technical skills to such a business it can be a force multiplier. Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

From being a place to debate/discuss technology and technology-related concepts to a source of news that has given me a edge (IMHO). Even at work I feel starved for that (not enough time and/or people interested in it) but here you can always find a topic to talk about and geek-out on.

If I'm really devoted to feeding the hungry, for instance, I should always remember the proper goal is to end hunger (outright). Even if that goal is unattainable. Maybe because that goal is unattainable.

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",

If they could do it, developers wouldn't have a problem. One must resist the temptation to help and should only observe how the users \"misuse\" the code. When they make a mistake, it's usually a good indicator of bad design, which is promptly corrected.

I've been a product management lead for 2 commercial open-core companies and people drastically overestimate: - How much code the community contributes (in both cases, >95% of all code was written by employees hired by the commercial company)\n- How few commercial resources are needed to support the community (running forums, answering GitHub tickets, etc)\n- How much financial support is actually forthcoming when there's not some \"locked commercial features\" As the paper points out, many of these widely used commercial projects receive a few hundred thousand dollars at most in donations (often much less) but need to employ more developers than that financing can support to maintain a baseline capability to address basic bug fixes (including security fixes) once they become \"popular enough\" to be known by the masses. reply",

It's one of the few open source projects (besides Blender and GIMP) that is used directly by non-technical end-users and that has managed to surpass its commercial brethren , both in features and popularity. This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use). The situation has gotten better since then, Windows now comes with Narrator, which is... usable, but NVDA is still the top contender for most (non-enterprise) use cases.

Most of us live a busy life, and it's usually hard to stop for a moment and think of the many things around us that make living better, even if it's a tiny open source project that solves a little, almost unknown, problem, run by some random guy in Hungary or Minnesota or Sicily. I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort. Side note: I am worried about robots, and am actively looking for a project that could make robot OS or components or the AI/brain that drives them, more human and less harmful.

Recently someone posted K-scale labs [4] as robot OS, but imo looks more like a well-funded SV startup that will go full OpenAI and close everything off as soon they hit R&D traction.

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

At their current level of importance, they need to be progressives, not revolutionaries. They essentially took up arms against the industry using covid as an excuse. Well, I personally despise the IP industry and think that it needs radical reform, if not complete destruction, we have to live to fight another day as well. Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States. The whole point of copyright and other protections was to ensure that there was some incentive to people to produce content and be able to monetize it. I think it's ludicrous to suggest that you need such an utterly long period with a shark full of teeth to go after people in order to incentivize the producing of content. reply",

You can offer your time, coding skills, feedback, design expertise, or simply help by spreading the word. In a world overflowing with information, visibility is a valuable form of support. Choosing to boycott what doesn't align with your values is often underappreciated but can be very impactful. Personally, I prefer to reshare and promote the projects I believe in.

At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators.

This was considerably more money than I could afford to contribute personally. And across more projects. When doing this it is important to communicate clearly if these are one-off contributions or if the projects can expect an annual contribution.  Sadly, I didn't trust the bean counters at my employer, so I made it clear that \"these are one off contributions - do not plan for future contributions from XYZ Corp\".  Still we managed to contribute for a handful of years. (They stopped contributing after I left the company.  Actually, the entire division, bean counters and all, was scrapped.

If your --about has it, cool if your --version has it cool, or in your Help->About menu option, cool.

I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

          "text": "There's a ton of money pouring into nuclear power right now, both fusion and fission. There are dozens of small VC-funded startups now in addition to the more \"traditional\" billionaire-funded nuclear startups. Each of them need SWEs to help with automating the physics/design simulations, document creation/management, plant design configuration/change management, QA compliance, construction management, experiment IT (instruments, controls, data collection, data reduction). Most companies have nuclear engineers like me who picked up some software skills along the way, but I've found it's always a huge benefit to bring in some nuclear-interested SWEs to help get things running with best practices. Some SWEs I've hired in the past felt a little isolated, but others have engaged well with the nuclear and mechanical engineers and had a great time. Be prepared for some weird fights with nuclear IT teams who are extra afraid of criminal penalties associated with export control laws. reply",

It's a good-enough boiling water reactor that Hitachi was able to construct with record-breaking speed. The IAEA is the best place to start.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects.  The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine.  It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files.  I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "https://easel.games A game engine that lets you code multiplayer games without coding the multiplayer! My idea was to put multiplayer into the fabric of the programming language itself. This allows the engine to automatically turn your game into a multiplayer game, without you needing to learn anything about networking or synchronization. I imagine there are lots of people who have the talent and creativity to create a multiplayer game but don't have the interest or patience in learning how to code multiplayer, and so that's who this is for! I've been working on this for 3 years and there were lots of tricky parts rolling back and deterministically executing a whole programming language, but it's working now! My next phase is to increase the breadth of features so better games can be made with it! reply",

          "text": "To be honest, that's kind of why I'm here posting about it. I think https://gatew.easel.games is impressive, but I also know the engine is capable of so much more than what people have made with it so far, and I'm trying to find people who have dreams but haven't found the right tool yet so I can build that for them. The pricing model and how to run Easel sustainably is a huge question. Easel is basically a free product, which is what I want because (a) I would just like people to use it and (b) multiplayer games need lots of players. I made the upfront decision to never run ads on Easel because I want parents and schools to be happy with it being used by their teenagers, and that has greatly changed the business dynamics. I have very delicately managed the cost-efficiency of Easel only expecting about 1% of people to ever subscribe to Easel+. For this reason, I've avoided expensive features so that one dedicated server can run at least 1 million projects and handle thousands of concurrent players at a manageable cost. It's been a real slimming exercise. I know the catalogue is small, but despite that, there are some people who come back and play one game every single day on Easel. There are also people who come back and make games every day on Easel. And there are some who do both. We have people exceeding 100+ hours a month sometimes. It's these people who Easel+ is for. Easel+ is designed as a package deal with a bunch of different game-playing and game-making perks so that people can decide for themselves what parts of the package they find valuable. But I would honestly be happy to have thousands of people using it and not paying a cent. This is my life's work and I just want it to be used, even if I have to fund it all myself. reply",

          "text": "Yes, in the end I just made this decision pragmatically and it's not a grand statement about how I think programming languages should work. I felt that it would be possible to add gradual typing to Easel eventually, and so chose to prioritise other programming language features. One of the original \"agitators\" which caused me to make Easel was because I was so surprised at how popular the modding tools for my previous game were with first-time coders. The modding tools used JSON, which might sound primitive, but if you look past the JSON it was actually defining a hierarchical declarative language for defining game behaviour. I have many theories for why first-time coders could just pick it up, but one of them is I think the hierarchical shape meant everything could be written inline, without indirection or jumping around. This format allowed all these gamers to just accidentally fall into coding and it was quite impressive how far they got without any help. But those old modding tools were quite limited really, and that limited how much coding people could learn. So for years I just kept wondering what would happen if someone made that magic hierarchical declarative shape unlimited by merging it with a traditional imperative programming language. Would it allow gamers to accidentally fall into learning actual coding? It took me about 2 years to squash together these two seemingly-opposed paradigms and make the Easel programming language. Doing this required slimming down on the other language features in order to iterate quickly on this big problem, so that's how we ended up not having strong typing, amongst other things. But I don't regret what I chose to prioritise, and I hope to address this in the coming years! reply",

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

It will not. And I say this as someone whose been building internal LLM tools since 2021. The issue is their context window. If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

          "text": "> For greenfield it’s amazing I'll preface this comment with: I am a recent startup owner (so only dev, which is important) and my entire codebase has been generated via Sonnet (mostly 3.7, now using 4.0). If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

Greenfield != boilerplate and basic CRUD app. I'm a consultant writing greenfield apps solo, and 90% of my time is spent away from my editor thinking, planning, designing, meeting with stakeholders. I see no benefit in using a low-IQ autocomplete tool to automate a small part of the remaining 10% of the job, the easiest and most enjoyable part in fact. Personally I find most of coding I do is unsuitable for LLMs anyway, because I don't need them to regurgitate standard logic when libraries are available, so most of that 10% is writing business logic tailored for the program/client. Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code. Less is more, and I appreciate programming-as-an-art rather than being a code monkey paid by the line of code I commit.

Just asking it \"Where does the check for X take place\" where there's tons of inheritance and auto-constructor magic in a codebase I rarely touch, it does a pretty good job of showing me the flow of logic. reply",

This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

Hell, only engineers know that the devil is in the details. Quick example: let’s say a Contact Us page needs to be built. There are tons of details that need to be accounted for and the LLM may skip them if it is not told about them: where does the data of the form go to? A backend endpoint? What about captcha? What about analytics? What about validation of specific fields? What about the friendly URL? And disabling the button after sending to prevent duplicate requests? An LLM is very capable of implementing all of that… if only someone who knows all of that stuff tell them first. And most importantly: LLMs don’t challenge the task given. Engineers do.

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

It obviously isn't 100x or even 10x except for very specific toy tasks, but for me it's probably around ~1.5-2x in everyday work. And I work on mostly long-tail scientific stuff, I imagine it's more if you do something like frontend dev with a lot of boilerplate. I'm absolutely convinced that people who say LLMs are not making them more productive either don't understand how to use them correctly, or they are working on very specific niche problems/infrastructure where they aren't useful. 2x may not sound like much compared to what you read in the media, but if a few years ago you had told companies that you can provably make their engineers even 2x more productive on average you'd probably be swimming in billions of dollars now. That kind of productivity increase is absolutely huge. reply",

It’s valuable to have it talk through something or explain why something is designed a certain way. So it’s definitely helped me grow as an engineer.

Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords??

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often.

Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

          "text": "Is it? I didn't bother to check as it wasn't too relevant. I wasn't stuck anymore. Worst-case it's a memnonic that is untrue. Best case: it is. For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

I think it's helpful to think of engineering as a _process_ instead of a role, and the reality is that a lot of development work doesn't necessarily rely on the strong engineering methodology (e.g. measurement, material properties, tolerances, modelling, etc.) that the people developing the software might imagine just based on the number of job adverts for 'engineers'. This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs. (Unless you're writing software for launching rockets, in which case the engineering _process_ porbably should be strong). reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch. I find this easier than the Cursor roll back or being overly cautious with suggested edits. I’m just getting to this realization so tbd if it works well.

Or the open source alternatives. That’s where people are seeing actual gains today. Why go all-in on anti-hype without talking about your direct experience? reply",

You get better output when your inputs are tuned to the scenario. Some of your inputs in this paradigm could be considered as optional parameters because you still get output without them. If you need to remember parts of the inputs in between user sessions then you need to save state of those somewhere to a disk. Databases are a common choice especially in web development but you could also just put things in a file. Another option if this isn't a web development context is to use something like sqlite since it will help organize the data a little better than say CSVs or similar. reply",

          "text": "Proper usage of LLMs so you don't just flood them with useless context will just be custom tailored prompts that only include the pertinent context, with prompts saying how it's related to what you're looking for. I don't think there's a cheap way around it maybe on the plus side you can tune them using ai code. \nI think tools are really over used and over-rated and have had horrible experience with them, nothing beats just custom tailoring stuff and setting up a system around it. What I do is use elixir pheonix, have a genserver keep track of the user state and I just include the related state in the request and just helper functions to generate the related prompts per type of state/context and append them wherever makes the most sense. I think LLMs make most sense to be viewed of as singular atomic interactions where you have the whole input (prompt/context/data) and get a concrete output. Everything else just seems like people being lazy trying to avoid thinking about the best way of structuring it. Where you put the context/data and how you include it will vary per prompt or the specific atomic interaction, there is no standard rule each interaction is unique. You have to experiment and see what provides the best output for each kind of request. I'd read Anthropics prompting docs if you haven't it's very good. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-... My way of thinking is just viewing every isolated LLM request as a unique function that is\nthe prompt + llm = a unique function\nContext is just what data you pass into the function (prompt+llm+settings(temp, etc))(data) to get whatever specific output you want. The prompt includes prewriting user/system messages, system prompt, structured output stuff or whatever. Any single request might lead to 1 or 30 of these that feed back into each other. \nBut yeah based on that it depends on just custom tailoring them for anything, it's pretty conceptual and intellectual but I find it fun but I don't think there's any easy way around it. Having the ability to have all your requests be stateful and modify what goes into the prompt based on the current user state (like genservers/elixir makes very easy) is a nice technical thing that helps though. reply",

I was specifically allowed to use company resources to develop the software (including reasonable time my manager signed off on) and in return the company would get a non-exclusive perpetual right to use and modify the software as they saw fit. This contract was a win-win.  My company got the features they wanted as part of my normal employment, but I also got to keep the idea and monetize it outside the company if I wanted to.  The company didn't need to worry about licensing if I left since I granted a perpetual right to use/modify. Unfortunately for various reasons the project never got completed and I never monotized it, so I can't tell you the real-world outcome, but I do know we were all happy with the terms going into it. reply",

          "text": "Mentioning that you negotiated to keep your code from falling under \"works for hire\" does a lot of heavy lifting in this (very well packed) example. I recommend that the OP dig into what \"works for hire\" means in the US to get a sense of what they should negotiate [to avoid]. It can definitely be a win/win for the company as well as for an enterprising engineer. The general idea is simply to go outside the scope of your contract and do something the company didn't ask for, in exchange for a bit of money and the right to reuse whatever code you developed for them. Avoiding works for hire contracts is how I built a 25 year war chest of reusable components and frameworks, each piece commissioned to an individual task but each used and modified in my next jobs for my next clients, until many versions later I would update my original clients with them. My advice to OP is to always present your ideas to owners or managers with open ears, and explain how it will help the company. Secondly, never do the work for free. Thirdly, always retain your rights to your ideas and your code when you're working on something creative. If they have a problem with that you can also explain that it's unlikely anyone else will either fill this niche to save them money or that any competitor will ever actually know about or use what you will build for them, but that having it at your disposal is a way for you to continue increasing their efficiency (which is true). It's also a way to make them beholden to you at very little initial cost. reply",

Formalizing the idea while employed and then taking it outside could be trouble.  Probably worth discussing details with a lawyer before attempting.

          "text": "Quick suggestion: maybe contact the vendor company and offer to create a frontend for them instead as a contract thing? --- I've gone through the exact scenarion in your question though, this is roughly the path I took (Estonia & EU, YMMV in other jurisdictions): - start by going over your contract - is this overall even allowed? Some companies capture all IP you create 24/7, in this case you'll need to get the contract changed or get an exception - even if your contract allows doing other work (creating separate IP) outside of company time, still ask for written permission from your manager and possibly a skip level or two. I got a written email from my VP of eng and CTO before proceeding. - you will probably need to _completely_ separate your own work from the company work. This means using your personal laptop, never working on this during work hours, etc. Separating this sometimes can be hard, especially if you get something like a bug report from your employer - you can't work with it until you're off the clock. - I also completely cut myself off from the purchasing decision - I let them know I was working on a project, gave them a landing page and let the purchasing team do a decision completely on their own - if you hope to build a business out of this it's best to be upfront about it, e.g. by telling your manager that you might leave to focus on the business full-time if it takes off All of this assumes you're on good terms with your employer overall. reply",

          "text": "IANAL either. I believe that UK law would be similar to that in Australia. To the best of my understanding, as an employee the IP of all work you produce is owned by the company. Even as a contractor you need rather specific contracts if your work for hire is not to be owned by the client. My first reaction is to advise you to let the idea go. The most likely outcome is that you will do a huge amount of work and then get caught up in legal nightmares. Getting legal advice up front won't spare you from more drama down the track. Assuming that there are many companies that use the same software and have similar needs, then you have the option of leaving, developing a MVP and then selling it to other companies first and eventually to your ex-employer.  Even then there are risks of being accused of taking proprietary information to enrich yourself. Another scenario is that the big-name company could beat you to the market with a poorly designed but aggressively marketed alternative to your solution. reply",

No one demands complete unconditional loyalty, but there should be some unwritten codes (regardless of what's written in your contract) People who value their freedom should not be salaried employees. Start yr own business & do whatever u want. With caveats, in some jurisdictions employees are much better protected by law than businesses or self-employed consultants/contractors, & companies often ask the latter to sign more draconian contracts, NDAs, and non-competes (viewing them as potential competitors). U can always negotiate, but there are less scurpolous businesses & consultants who will sign any contract just to get the project/deal, & that's lowers the bar for everyone reply",

Talk to your execs (ideally, the CEO) directly and sell this. On failure, be prepared to work on this internally. If so, ask for more money/promotion, which may not work but will not hurt either. 2. Call the other company and offer to improve their product for more money/promotion. 3. Get a techie friend to front for you: he approaches your company, you do the work, he shares the money.

And then the entrepreneurial answer is to skip all that, go build it yourself, then sell it to many organizations. But you probably cannot do that as an employee, depending on your employment contract. So sure, the surface levels answers are to talk to a lawyer, your manager, etc. But the deeper answer is to decide on and commit to a direction - are you happy being an employee, or do you need to walk out and start your own thing? (And as a side note, don't build a startup that is a front-end to someone else's product. It may fill a need, but you are going to be spending all your hours keeping up with their changes, and ultimately your success is tied to their decisions and they could wipe you out just by spending a month improving their UX.) reply",

If it's something that's specific to your company and there is no market outside it, you have one customer that at the same time has strong leverage over you due to your current employment. If it's something that could be generally useful, you likely still don't have a market: if your product ever became popular, the big-name company selling the original software could add it as a feature or paid extension and would have a huge marketing advantage over you. The company you currently work for will likely not be willing to pay much for your work, and might take offense and fire you if you try to negotiate too hard. They could also decide that your new job is writing this thing... You could try to leverage it for a bonus or promotion or something like that. That's unlikely to capture a significant amount of the value you provide, but so are the other options. If you think the idea in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44080196 will fly, you could try that. I think it's unlikely to fly but it's the option that likely pays out best if it does fly, and if you approach it carefully (\"this is outside the scope of my role and my department, but I could do it in my free time\"), you might be able to pull it off with limited risk. You also need to understand how decision processes work at your company and optimize your proposal for it. If it's more work to get legal to approve the contract with you than to get approval to pay 10x as much to the original vendor to add something half as good as a feature, the vendor gets the job. reply",

          "text": "All decisions/actions have a “ceiling” and a “floor”, the best possible outcome and the worst. Let’s consider them for this situation. Ceiling - Company buys your software - You sell it to other companies - This becomes your full time job Floor - Fired - Trust lost, future advancement blocked (not saying it’s right, just that it could happen) Also important are how likely the outcomes are. Looking at the above and my own experience working at companies, having side projects, and selling them, I think you are much closer to the floor than the ceiling (in probability). Here are some hard truths: - Even if something is a win-win, many companies will not see it that way. They often react negatively to things they don’t understand or are uncommon. - Depending on where you work it might be impossible to develop a side project without the company owning the IP (sometimes you can get a special waiver but not if it has overlap with what your company does) - How capable are you of writing this software and are you really sure you have the problem/solution well understood? I don’t want to be rude but it sounds like you saw one presentation and think you can build and sell a solution that’s not spec’d out. I’m also not sure if your skill set, have you created software like this on your own before? - Just because people are enthusiastic about the prospect of this tool doesn’t mean they are willing to pay for it (or will even still be interested 1 day, 1 week, 1 month from now) - Developing software for a company (as an employee) and developing on your own are 2 different sets of skills. There is overlap, but it’s not the same - Sales/Marketing and running a business are a completely different set of skills. It’s rare to have a developer who can also do this well. Not impossible, just rare. - If you aren’t passionate about this then even if you are successful, you will not be happy. Employee? Work on whatever, no problem. Contractor? Work on whatever. Sole proprietor? Make sure it’s something you enjoy/care about. Maybe you do care about YAML file GUIs. At a minimum I would wait 2-4 weeks and gauge interest in the tool again. See if people are still super interested or if it’s “Huh? Oh yeah, ehh, it was just something that would be cool but we wouldn’t pay for it”. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, think everyone is as excited as you, then find out later they don’t care. Also use this time to see if the project still interests YOU. If, after all of this, you still want to pursue this then make sure to check your employment contract and even if there is nothing about side-projects/IP get _written_ approval from your manager. Lastly, ignore the people here suggesting you do anything “sneaky”, like the “I have a friend who is developing software that does this”. This is no way to live and those chickens will come home to roost. Either the company will catch you and/or you will be committing some kind of crime if you do obscure it. In all honesty there is a _very_ low chance that this is worth pursuing. I know personally how easy it can be to get caught up in an idea like this but the chances of it working out are low. Maybe in a better world they would be higher but I’ve seen enough to assume that the company will respond _poorly_ even to a well reasoned and mutually advantageous offer. It sucks, but that’s just the reality of most places. Even if your company is not like this, it still might be better for you to just pitch working on it internally and leverage a bonus/raise/title. reply",

          "text": "Persevere. Get emotionally invested. Be a little stubborn. Commit 100%. As investors say, strong opinions, weakly held. The stages of grief are a biological checklist: 1. Denial: Is it a measurement error? A fluke? Not enough time? Unexpected disadvantage? 2. Anger: Am I a coward for abandoning this? Why did I do this in the first place? Does the new path go against my moral values? 3. Bargaining: Is there a way around this problem? Do I need to give up or can I concede something? 4. Depression: At this point, you accept it is over. Mourn the idea. Have some kind of ritual. Blog about failure. Separate from it cleanly. The trick is to approach each stage logically . People tend to be completely irrational. They'll call the data fake, blame the sources, blame luck, blame privilege, government, etc. People get stuck on this for years. They become scared of failure. They burn through the passion, then rely on discipline. Then they burn through the discipline too and settle wherever they are. Go through the grief, but treat it like a form. You have to deal with each stage, especially depression and the burial of that goal. Sometimes you get stuck at bargaining - \"I'll come back to this project later.\" reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have talked to a number of people regarding this. The classic pivot vs persevere problem. 1) My view is that you don't/can't really know in advance. Most of the examples you see/hear about are retrospective, and suffers from survivorship bias and/or positive reporting bias. Ex. Typically, you only hear about how people's decisions led to success. Or you only hear about earlier failures if the subject later succeeded. What you don't hear about are other people who made similar choices and still failed. Unless you're connected to these builders/founders networks and have insider-access/great rapport, it'll be difficult for you to get exposed to the hidden, unreported side. 2) What's worth analyzing are the material consequences of whatever outcome/decision path. One thing you do want to avoid is anything that could take you out of the game, so to speak. Like huge financial obligations, etc. 3) And most decisions aren't so black and white. There's a very large, gray area in between where you could get real creative. In this gray area are 3rd options where you could be positioning yourself for long-term sustainability to work on whatever it is on your mind. Sometimes I call it \"pivot to persevere.\" Ex. creating another venture B to fund venture A. reply",

Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

          "text": "My 2 centes: 1. Learn basic NNs at a simple level, build from scratch (no frameworks) a feed forward neural network with back propagation to train against MNIST or something as simple. Understand every part of it. Just use your favorite programming language. 2. Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy. This is just some useful technology surrounded by a lot of hype of all the people that want to get rich with AI and understand they can't compete with the LLMs themselves. So they pump the part that can be kinda \"productized\". Never forget that the product is the neural network itself, for the most part. reply",

A full-stack engineer will likely have at least a solid understanding of the HTTP protocol, HTTPS, WebSockets, the interface layer between the frontend server and their chosen Web webdev stack, and so on.

I’ve noticed that Gemini 2.5 Pro seems way dumber when used in the Copilot agent, vs me just running all the required context through OpenRouter in Continue.dev. The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

Same with coding stacks. There are plenty of ways to use what's available now, as \"tools\". Play around, see what they can do for you now, see where it might lead.

The first group is definitely not hype. Their core business relies on ML and they don’t need hype for that to be true. For the second group, it depends on the business model. The fact that you can make an API call doesn’t mean anything. What matters is solving a customer problem.

If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking.

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

With low demand for AI internals and a high supply of talent—many people have earned data science certificates in AI hoping to land lucrative jobs at OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.—the bar for accessing these few roles is very high. 2/ The risk here is AI makes everyone good at full-stack. This means more competition for roles, less demand for roles (now 1 in-experienced engineer with AI, can output 1.5x the code an experience Senior engineer could do in 2020). In the short/medium term, 2/ has the best risk/reward function. But 1/ is more future proof. Another important question is where are you in your career? If you're 45 years old, I'd encourage you to switch into leadership roles for 2/. This wont be replaced by AI. If you're early in your career, it could make more sense to switch. reply",

          "text": "Hi, I am working in making the term \"llm developer\" more popular in France and train people to this new job.\nWe will need a bunch of them in the months/years to come to implement advanced AI systems after companies manage to properly pick and set up their AI platforms. Currently people would tend to involve data scientists into this job, but data scientists are often less versed into the software engineering aspect, eg when they work more on notebooks than web apps.\nThe job is akin to being a web developer, so a \"normal\" developer but specialized in a certain field. Knowing the internals of LLMs is a big bonus, but you can start your journey with treating them as black box tools and still craft relevant solutions. You'll need to learn about running systems with databases (vector, graph, relational and nosql are all useful) and plugging multiple services together (docker, kubernetes, cloud hosting). reply",

Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

It's an open source web framework I have been working  on ( https://github.com/adamritter/pageql ). To tell you the truth it slowed down yesterday as most of the features were done and I had to fix memory/signal/callback leaks, but even that was done much faster than if I did it by hand.

Engineering solutions with LLM is a lot of fiddling,\nwhich is experimental rather than analytical/logical. It is worth getting use to that mind-set, and then use LLMs as a tool (they are likely here to stay, because big tech have started to integrate features based on them everywhere, for better or worse). So this is your option (2.). Personally, I prefer software I use NOT to be smart, but to be 100% deterministic. But already my favorite LaTeX authoring environment (Overleaf) has a button pop up called \"fix this\" that auto-resolves syntax errors, many of which overwhelm my doctoral students that no longer read books end-to-end (here, to learn LaTeX). Gradually, you may dive deeper into the \"how\", driven by either need or curiosity, so eventually you will probably have done both (2.) and (1.). - in the same way that you will have first learned SQL before learning how replication, transactions, data buffers and caches, or query optimizers are implemented. reply",

Take databases as example, network stack, etc. Just because a field is popular, doesn't mean you should switch to going deep into it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it - it costs a few dollars to try it out and see whether it fits your workflow. If it does, this is great and you can be more productive and focus on stuff that you can solve and LLM can't, but if it doesn't, that is fine too. reply",

          "text": "I think this type of question is, roughly, backwards. If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

          "text": "I've always been under the impression that if you make something truly useful or interesting, it will spread through word of mouth naturally and quickly. This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "Realistically, it was probably graduating high school. It's step one in the so-called 'success sequence' for a reason: 1. Finish high school. 2. Get a full-time job once you finish school. 3. Get married before you have children. 97% of millennials who followed that sequence avoided poverty by the time we hit age 30 or so, so it's got a pretty good success rate. #2 has the most immediate impact here, but #1 makes #2 much easier, and not following #3 sadly makes #2 moderately harder (juggling childcare is tough even in the best of circumstances). Finishing college would be a somewhat distant second, as it makes the entry pathway into a lot of white collar jobs a lot easier, even internationally. This was especially important when I realized pretty soon after finishing college that I had good reason to leave the US. I'm now happily married with kids and full time employed in a senior position here in Finland, all by 30, so I'd say I've done pretty well for myself. reply",

          "text": "This [0] comment and discussion under it about how non technical businesses are very rarely run by technical people, and how if you apply your technical skills to such a business it can be a force multiplier. Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

The really important computing nowadays is all done on the GPU; the CPU is little more than a front-end processor. Furthermore, with AI and LLMs we're rapidly converging on a future where programming won't even resemble programming as we know it. If you're young and talented, the time to get ahead of the game is NOW. I am no longer young, so I will probably be one of the ones left behind. reply",

If I'm really devoted to feeding the hungry, for instance, I should always remember the proper goal is to end hunger (outright). Even if that goal is unattainable. Maybe because that goal is unattainable.

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",

I spent the whole day today writing a JavaScript serialization package, and even though I know someone has already done it, I am still willing to write a new one for my specific scenario.\nOn the other hand, I think that although AI seems friendly to newcomers (inexperienced developers), it is actually more friendly to experienced developers because you can have AI help you complete some tasks and then review them yourself. Inexperienced developers have difficulty accurately pinpointing problems when they encounter issues, causing AI to keep going in circles and hitting walls. reply",

          "text": "The only software project I donate to is NVDA[1]. It's an open source screen reader, AKA software that makes it possible for the blind to use computers through synthesized speech. It's one of the few open source projects (besides Blender and GIMP) that is used directly by non-technical end-users and that has managed to surpass its commercial brethren , both in features and popularity. This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use). The situation has gotten better since then, Windows now comes with Narrator, which is... usable, but NVDA is still the top contender for most (non-enterprise) use cases.

Most of us live a busy life, and it's usually hard to stop for a moment and think of the many things around us that make living better, even if it's a tiny open source project that solves a little, almost unknown, problem, run by some random guy in Hungary or Minnesota or Sicily. I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort. Side note: I am worried about robots, and am actively looking for a project that could make robot OS or components or the AI/brain that drives them, more human and less harmful. If you know anything worth exploring, please share. reply",

De-facto standard at least in academia, some startups (for MVP), and institutes. If you are more keen about the hardware side (imo this side probably require more funding if you really want to keep Robots OS, software can come later) I like Robot Studios work by Rob Knight [2], it's OS afaik, with projects such as DexHand [3]. Recently someone posted K-scale labs [4] as robot OS, but imo looks more like a well-funded SV startup that will go full OpenAI and close everything off as soon they hit R&D traction.

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

At their current level of importance, they need to be progressives, not revolutionaries. They essentially took up arms against the industry using covid as an excuse. Well, I personally despise the IP industry and think that it needs radical reform, if not complete destruction, we have to live to fight another day as well. Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States. The whole point of copyright and other protections was to ensure that there was some incentive to people to produce content and be able to monetize it. I think it's ludicrous to suggest that you need such an utterly long period with a shark full of teeth to go after people in order to incentivize the producing of content. reply",

At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators.

          "text": "Supporting a project doesn't always mean donating money; contributions can take many forms. You can offer your time, coding skills, feedback, design expertise, or simply help by spreading the word. In a world overflowing with information, visibility is a valuable form of support. Choosing to boycott what doesn't align with your values is often underappreciated but can be very impactful. Personally, I prefer to reshare and promote the projects I believe in. It's not about financial contributions—it's about increasing their reach. Sometimes, that's what makes the most significant impact.

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

My main concern would be to overwhelm recipients if they'd ever get included in multiple people's newsletters. I've been building on the opposite end of this. It's an open-source form submissions forwarder. I built it mostly because I wanted a service thats transparent, with usage based pricing that I could use economically for my low traffick sites. Sometime this year I want to add docker-compose to make it easier to self host. Currently it's all manual. https://simplecontactform.org reply",

Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery. reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

          "text": "https://easel.games A game engine that lets you code multiplayer games without coding the multiplayer! My idea was to put multiplayer into the fabric of the programming language itself. This allows the engine to automatically turn your game into a multiplayer game, without you needing to learn anything about networking or synchronization. I imagine there are lots of people who have the talent and creativity to create a multiplayer game but don't have the interest or patience in learning how to code multiplayer, and so that's who this is for! I've been working on this for 3 years and there were lots of tricky parts rolling back and deterministically executing a whole programming language, but it's working now!

          "text": "To be honest, that's kind of why I'm here posting about it. I think https://gatew.easel.games is impressive, but I also know the engine is capable of so much more than what people have made with it so far, and I'm trying to find people who have dreams but haven't found the right tool yet so I can build that for them. The pricing model and how to run Easel sustainably is a huge question. Easel is basically a free product, which is what I want because (a) I would just like people to use it and (b) multiplayer games need lots of players. I made the upfront decision to never run ads on Easel because I want parents and schools to be happy with it being used by their teenagers, and that has greatly changed the business dynamics. I have very delicately managed the cost-efficiency of Easel only expecting about 1% of people to ever subscribe to Easel+. For this reason, I've avoided expensive features so that one dedicated server can run at least 1 million projects and handle thousands of concurrent players at a manageable cost. It's been a real slimming exercise. I know the catalogue is small, but despite that, there are some people who come back and play one game every single day on Easel. There are also people who come back and make games every day on Easel. And there are some who do both. We have people exceeding 100+ hours a month sometimes. It's these people who Easel+ is for. Easel+ is designed as a package deal with a bunch of different game-playing and game-making perks so that people can decide for themselves what parts of the package they find valuable. But I would honestly be happy to have thousands of people using it and not paying a cent. This is my life's work and I just want it to be used, even if I have to fund it all myself. reply",

          "text": "Yes, in the end I just made this decision pragmatically and it's not a grand statement about how I think programming languages should work. I felt that it would be possible to add gradual typing to Easel eventually, and so chose to prioritise other programming language features. One of the original \"agitators\" which caused me to make Easel was because I was so surprised at how popular the modding tools for my previous game were with first-time coders. The modding tools used JSON, which might sound primitive, but if you look past the JSON it was actually defining a hierarchical declarative language for defining game behaviour. I have many theories for why first-time coders could just pick it up, but one of them is I think the hierarchical shape meant everything could be written inline, without indirection or jumping around. This format allowed all these gamers to just accidentally fall into coding and it was quite impressive how far they got without any help. But those old modding tools were quite limited really, and that limited how much coding people could learn. So for years I just kept wondering what would happen if someone made that magic hierarchical declarative shape unlimited by merging it with a traditional imperative programming language. Would it allow gamers to accidentally fall into learning actual coding? It took me about 2 years to squash together these two seemingly-opposed paradigms and make the Easel programming language. Doing this required slimming down on the other language features in order to iterate quickly on this big problem, so that's how we ended up not having strong typing, amongst other things. But I don't regret what I chose to prioritise, and I hope to address this in the coming years! reply",

So what I usually do is pick a random blurb in the news and paste the entire thing along with the Reuters link at the beginning and inform chatgpt that we'll be carrying on language practice specifically over that topic of discussion. I've used this to carry an hour long foreign language practice in Spanish while walking my dog without even needing to look at my phone. reply",

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

At a certain point it’s easier to add the new feature or make the modification yourself. Even if the LLM could do it, it would burn tons of money and time. I expect things to get better, this will not always be the state of things, but for now “vibe coding” (specifically not reviewing/writing code yourself) is not sustainable.

It will not. And I say this as someone whose been building internal LLM tools since 2021. The issue is their context window. If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

All team members should follow these guidelines when creating, updating, or completing tickets. ## Ticket Organization Tickets are organized by status and area in the following structure: TICKETS/\n  COMPLETED/       - Finished tickets\n    BACKEND/       - Backend-related tickets\n    FRONTEND/      - Frontend-related tickets\n  IN_PROGRESS/     - Tickets currently being worked on\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/\n  BACKLOG/         - Tickets planned but not yet started\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/ ## Ticket Status Indicators All tickets must use consistent status indicators: -  *BACKLOG* - Planned but not yet started\n-  *IN_PROGRESS* - Currently being implemented\n-  *COMPLETED* - Implementation is finished\n-  *ABANDONED* - Work was stopped and will not continue ## Required Ticket Files Each ticket directory must contain these files: 1. *Main Ticket File* (TICKET_ .md):\n   - Problem statement and background\n   - Detailed analysis\n   - Implementation plan\n   - Acceptance criteria 2. *Implementation Plan* (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):\n   - Detailed breakdown of tasks\n   - Timeline estimates\n   - Success metrics 3. *Implementation Progress* (IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md):\n   - Status updates\n   - Issues encountered\n   - Decisions made 4. *Design Documentation* (DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md), when relevant:\n   - Architecture recommendations\n   - Code patterns and examples\n   - Error handling strategies 5. *API Documentation* (API_DOCUMENTATION.md), when applicable:\n   - Interface definitions\n   - Usage examples\n   - Configuration options ## Ticket Workflow Rules ### Creating Tickets 1. Create tickets in the appropriate BACKLOG directory\n2. Use standard templates from .templates/ticket_template.md\n3. Set status to *Status: BACKLOG* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ### Updating Tickets 1. Move tickets to the appropriate status directory when status changes\n2. Update the status indicator in the main ticket file\n3. Update the \"Last Updated\" date when making significant changes\n4. Document progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md\n5. Check off completed tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ### Completing Tickets 1. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met\n2. Move the ticket to the COMPLETED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: COMPLETED*\n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file\n5. Create a completion summary in the main ticket file ### Abandoning Tickets 1. Document reasons for abandonment\n2. Move to COMPLETED/ABANDONED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: ABANDONED* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ## Ticket Linking When referencing other tickets, use relative links with appropriate paths: markdown\n@TICKET_NAME Ensure all links are updated when tickets change status. ## Ticket Cleanup and Streamlining ### When to Streamline Tickets Tickets should be streamlined and cleaned up at major transition points to maintain focus on remaining work: 1. *Major Phase Transitions* - When moving between phases (e.g., from implementation to testing)\n2. *Milestone Achievements* - After completing significant portions of work (e.g., 80%+ complete)\n3. *Infrastructure Readiness* - When moving from setup/building to operational phases\n4. *Team Handoffs* - When different team members will be taking over the work ### What to Streamline *Replace Historical Implementation Details With:*\n- Brief completed tasks checklist ( high-level achievements)\n- Current status summary\n- Forward-focused remaining work *Remove or Simplify:*\n- Detailed session-by-session progress logs\n- Extensive implementation decision histories\n- Verbose research findings documentation\n- Historical status updates and coordination notes ### Why Streamline Tickets 1. *Git History Preservation* - All detailed progress, decisions, and implementation details are preserved in git commits\n2. *Clarity for Future Work* - Makes it easier to quickly understand \"what needs to be done next\"\n3. *Team Efficiency* - Anyone picking up the work can immediately see current state and next steps\n4. *Maintainability* - Shorter, focused tickets are easier to read, understand, and keep updated ### How to Streamline 1. *Archive Detailed Progress* - Historical implementation details are preserved in git history\n2. *Create Completion Summary* - Replace detailed progress with a brief \"What's Complete\" checklist\n3. *Focus on Remaining Work* - Make current and future phases the primary content\n4. *Update Status Sections* - Keep status concise and action-oriented\n5. *Preserve Essential Context* - Keep architectural decisions, constraints, and key requirements *Goal*: Transform tickets from \"implementation logs\" into \"actionable work plans\" while preserving essential context. ## Maintenance Requirements 1. Keep the TICKET_INDEX.md file up to date\n2. Update \"Last Updated\" dates when making significant changes\n3. Ensure all ticket files follow the standardized format\n4. Include links between related tickets in both directions ## Complete Documentation For detailed instructions on working with tickets, refer to: - @Ticket Workflow Guide\n- @Ticket Index\n- @Tickets README ``` reply",

LLM doesn’t have a standardized directory structure, so you end up with different projects having different structures and file naming conventions. This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code. I very much prefer having a company template to asking an LLM to generate the initial project. reply",

Greenfield != boilerplate and basic CRUD app. I'm a consultant writing greenfield apps solo, and 90% of my time is spent away from my editor thinking, planning, designing, meeting with stakeholders. I see no benefit in using a low-IQ autocomplete tool to automate a small part of the remaining 10% of the job, the easiest and most enjoyable part in fact. Personally I find most of coding I do is unsuitable for LLMs anyway, because I don't need them to regurgitate standard logic when libraries are available, so most of that 10% is writing business logic tailored for the program/client. Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code. Less is more, and I appreciate programming-as-an-art rather than being a code monkey paid by the line of code I commit.

Hell, only engineers know that the devil is in the details. Quick example: let’s say a Contact Us page needs to be built. There are tons of details that need to be accounted for and the LLM may skip them if it is not told about them: where does the data of the form go to? A backend endpoint? What about captcha? What about analytics? What about validation of specific fields? What about the friendly URL? And disabling the button after sending to prevent duplicate requests? An LLM is very capable of implementing all of that… if only someone who knows all of that stuff tell them first. And most importantly: LLMs don’t challenge the task given. Engineers do.

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords??

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often.

Then came things like SO, and that was a step more productive. I find LLMs to be another step forward, but not like a quantum leap or anything. Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

If you are looking for rigorous formal proofs, you won't find them on this book. But it is a quite funny and quirk book that gives you a different perspective on math concepts and will satisfy your hunger for knowing the people and the historical context behind it. reply",

          "text": "Is it? I didn't bother to check as it wasn't too relevant. I wasn't stuck anymore. Worst-case it's a memnonic that is untrue. Best case: it is. For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs.

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand.

It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch.

          "text": "Proper usage of LLMs so you don't just flood them with useless context will just be custom tailored prompts that only include the pertinent context, with prompts saying how it's related to what you're looking for. I don't think there's a cheap way around it maybe on the plus side you can tune them using ai code. \nI think tools are really over used and over-rated and have had horrible experience with them, nothing beats just custom tailoring stuff and setting up a system around it. What I do is use elixir pheonix, have a genserver keep track of the user state and I just include the related state in the request and just helper functions to generate the related prompts per type of state/context and append them wherever makes the most sense. I think LLMs make most sense to be viewed of as singular atomic interactions where you have the whole input (prompt/context/data) and get a concrete output. Everything else just seems like people being lazy trying to avoid thinking about the best way of structuring it. Where you put the context/data and how you include it will vary per prompt or the specific atomic interaction, there is no standard rule each interaction is unique. You have to experiment and see what provides the best output for each kind of request. I'd read Anthropics prompting docs if you haven't it's very good. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-... My way of thinking is just viewing every isolated LLM request as a unique function that is\nthe prompt + llm = a unique function\nContext is just what data you pass into the function (prompt+llm+settings(temp, etc))(data) to get whatever specific output you want. The prompt includes prewriting user/system messages, system prompt, structured output stuff or whatever. Any single request might lead to 1 or 30 of these that feed back into each other. \nBut yeah based on that it depends on just custom tailoring them for anything, it's pretty conceptual and intellectual but I find it fun but I don't think there's any easy way around it. Having the ability to have all your requests be stateful and modify what goes into the prompt based on the current user state (like genservers/elixir makes very easy) is a nice technical thing that helps though. reply",

          "text": "Almost. Super Tetris 3 on SNES has one mode like this called Maglicaliss. -You have full R/G/B tetrominoes. -Doing a full 360 rotation of a tetromino cycles it between the three the colours. -If you make a line that is all one colour, every one of that colour is cleared off the field. -If you do a line of mixed colours, it is a regular line-clear. There are also steel (grey) tri/do/monominoes, which complicates things a bit: -Steel minoes fall at random just like any other tetrominoe. -Steel minoes do not change colour from 360s. -Lines with steel blocks allow for regular line-clears with the caveat that the steel blocks stay on screen after a clear. This can lead to combos, since clearing a line will have the above line move down to connect with steel blocks from the previously cleared line. -The only way to clear a steel blocks is to make a full steel line. -Full steel lines, like lines of all one colour will clear the entire field of steel blocks. Super Tetris 3 also has stadard Tetris and Sparkliss, which is mostly like Bombliss on Tetris Blast and Super Tetris 2. Note there are still line-clears in bombliss, it's NOT like NES Tetris 2, which is essentially Doctor Mario with tetrominoes. The Next Tetris on PSX/SAT/PC has a mode with mixed coloured tetrominoes that fall after a line-clear and make combos. I forget the specifics but that game is heavily broken. Rotations after touching down, reset the lock timer. You can endlessly rotate tetrominoes to take the time to decide where to leave it. High recommend the Super Tets. They along with Tetris 64, (Not to be confused with Tetrisphere, which sucks), are some of my favourite variants. That said, Nothing holds a candle to Tetris Party Premium or OF COURSE, Tetris The Grand Master series. (IMO) If you haven't played The Grand Master series and have an interest in Tetris... oh my god, please try it. It does things to my brain that nothing else in life has done.

          "text": "Depends on what you want to do. But my 2 cents are that like all new technology, LLMs will become a commodity. Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

          "text": "LLMs already are a commodity. Google has already kicked off the competitive price wars.  Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

Learn basic NNs at a simple level, build from scratch (no frameworks) a feed forward neural network with back propagation to train against MNIST or something as simple. Understand every part of it. Just use your favorite programming language. 2. Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy. This is just some useful technology surrounded by a lot of hype of all the people that want to get rich with AI and understand they can't compete with the LLMs themselves. So they pump the part that can be kinda \"productized\". Never forget that the product is the neural network itself, for the most part. reply",

(That's not to say that you shouldn't bother with learning more -- more knowledge is always good -- or that the OP specifically only knows that. It's more a sensible minimum.) My own \"curriculum\" for that has been Jeremy Howard's Fast AI course and Sebastian Raschka's book \"build an LLM from scratch\".  Still working through it, but once I'm done I think I'll be solid on your point 2 above.

Are all these points based on preparing for a future where LLMs are even better? Or do you think they're good enough now that they will transform the way software is built and software engineers work, with just better tooling? I've tried to keep up with them somewhat, and dabble with Claude Code and have personal subscriptions to Gemini and ChatGPT as well. They're impressive and almost magical, but I can't help but feel they're not quite there yet . My company is making a big AI push, as are so many companies, and it feels like no one wants to be \"left behind\" when they \"really take off\".

I just believe that the excellence in the field is human+LLM). So failing to learn LLMs right now is yet not catastrophic, but creates a disadvantage because certain things become more explorable / faster with the help of 200 yet-not-so-smart PHDs in all the human disciplines.

          "text": "My problem with 5. is that there are many unknowns, especially when it comes to agents. They have wildly different system prompts that are optimized on a daily basis. I’ve noticed that Gemini 2.5 Pro seems way dumber when used in the Copilot agent, vs me just running all the required context through OpenRouter in Continue.dev. The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

Sure, agentsdotcom or flowsdotcom or ragdotcom might fail (likely IMO), but the stack is here to stay, and it's only gonna get better, cheaper, more integrated. What is becoming increasingly clear, IMO, is that you have to spend some time with this. Prompting an LLM is like the old google-fu. You need to gain experience with it, to make the most out of it. Same with coding stacks. There are plenty of ways to use what's available now, as \"tools\". Play around, see what they can do for you now, see where it might lead.

I would bucket the companies into two groups: 1) Established companies (meta/google/uber) with lots of data and who want MLEs to make 0.1% improvements because each of those is worth millions. 2) Startups mostly proxying OpenAI calls. The first group is definitely not hype. Their core business relies on ML and they don’t need hype for that to be true. For the second group, it depends on the business model. The fact that you can make an API call doesn’t mean anything. What matters is solving a customer problem. I also (selfishly) believe a lot of the second group will hire folks to train faster and more personalized models once their business models are proven. reply",

          "text": "I think about this a lot. If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking. That’s my 2 cents, shredded, not sliced. reply",

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

If nobody has a job, how do they acquire food, shelter, clothes, etc? And if people don't have money to buy \"stuff\" then what need is there for factories to produce \"stuff\", or stores to sell \"stuff\" and so on? So does economic output just drop to zero? Or near zero? Of course there are proposals around UBI and what-not and maybe one or more of those is the answer (if all of this comes to pass in the first place).

With low demand for AI internals and a high supply of talent—many people have earned data science certificates in AI hoping to land lucrative jobs at OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.—the bar for accessing these few roles is very high. 2/ The risk here is AI makes everyone good at full-stack. This means more competition for roles, less demand for roles (now 1 in-experienced engineer with AI, can output 1.5x the code an experience Senior engineer could do in 2020). In the short/medium term, 2/ has the best risk/reward function. But 1/ is more future proof. Another important question is where are you in your career? If you're 45 years old, I'd encourage you to switch into leadership roles for 2/. This wont be replaced by AI. If you're early in your career, it could make more sense to switch. reply",

Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

I'm able to get changes out of it, that mostly make sense, but you really need to take whatever personal guidelines you have for coding and \"encode\" them into the AGENTS.md, and really focus on asking the right question/request changes in the right way. Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

And of course it contains lots of corrections. sometimes it's 30 lines with some bug that I see, then I ask codex to fix the bug in a separate pull request. It's an open source web framework I have been working  on ( https://github.com/adamritter/pageql ). To tell you the truth it slowed down yesterday as most of the features were done and I had to fix memory/signal/callback leaks, but even that was done much faster than if I did it by hand. I had done coding on my phone while buying flowers in a gardening store, in my bed waking up without getting out my laptop etc... so yeah,  it's not for those people who take the 8 hour work day strictly. reply",

Engineering solutions with LLM is a lot of fiddling,\nwhich is experimental rather than analytical/logical. It is worth getting use to that mind-set, and then use LLMs as a tool (they are likely here to stay, because big tech have started to integrate features based on them everywhere, for better or worse). So this is your option (2.). Personally, I prefer software I use NOT to be smart, but to be 100% deterministic. But already my favorite LaTeX authoring environment (Overleaf) has a button pop up called \"fix this\" that auto-resolves syntax errors, many of which overwhelm my doctoral students that no longer read books end-to-end (here, to learn LaTeX). Gradually, you may dive deeper into the \"how\", driven by either need or curiosity, so eventually you will probably have done both (2.) and (1.). - in the same way that you will have first learned SQL before learning how replication, transactions, data buffers and caches, or query optimizers are implemented. reply",

Sure, it is good to know how some of the things work under the good, but you can be perfectly capable developer by reading docs and knowing how to use tools - without needing to know how to write them or how they do complex things under the hood. Take databases as example, network stack, etc. Just because a field is popular, doesn't mean you should switch to going deep into it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it - it costs a few dollars to try it out and see whether it fits your workflow. If it does, this is great and you can be more productive and focus on stuff that you can solve and LLM can't, but if it doesn't, that is fine too. reply",

If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

          "text": "My friend and I have been building an app over the past few years, and it's been a slow, sometimes painful grind. We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

After I posted my new project/business to reddit. I got a grand total of 3 views. Next idea proposed is email blast, but to what email list I dont have? I do have a 1 week free trial for anyone who signs up and finds out they dont have a next gen firewall that accepts threatfeeds. Webinars and live demos to who? MSSP partnership? This might be a good path to approach. Wear a tshirt with my website/brand on it to security conferences? I was maybe planning to go to a bsides event later in the year i guess. Marketplaces like AWS or Azure marketplace? I dunno? I guess the best I can do is http://mapleintel.ca reply",

People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying.

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

This really lifted the pressure off. It doesn't matter if it doesn't work in the end, just see how far you can go. It's really simple. This allowed me to launch a product, make a few thousand bucks from it, and then fold it, cause it wasn't such a good idea. This same advice allowed me to finish the 1st version of a screenplay I wanted to write. I am in the 2nd version now. We'll see where it goes. reply",

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

          "text": "I'm still working on a complete overhaul of German health insurance advice for immigrants. It's a really boring topic BUT a fascinating problem. The system is complex. Choosing the best option is difficult. Understanding the timelines, the required documents, and how to prove coverage for a visa application or school enrolment is super complex. I'm trying to streamline the whole thing. I released phase one yesterday. It's a simple overhaul of the text advice plus a new health insurance calculator. I also paired up with a health insurance broker to give more personalised advice, since everyone needs a different recommendation. It's here: https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance I'm now working on phase two: covering the exact process of getting insured for a visa application. I really want to walk people through the exact order of things, with detailed steps and timelines. The calculator will get a hell of a lot more complicated. Phase three is compressing all of that. Once I have a good idea of how things work and where friction can be reduced, I'll simplify and automate as much of it as possible. It should turn a messy, complex and confusing process into a fairly straightforward thing. I feel like no one is really doing this yet, and I'm surprised at how achievable it is. reply",

I have a few passion projects that I'm working on (between the somewhat substantial consulting work that came out of the woodwork): - Nuclear Reactor Starter Kit --- an open source set of procedures, processes, templates, and maybe even some IT advice that should help newcomers start companies with nuclear quality assurance programs easily and quickly while also making a new format in which nuclear companies can share lessons learned in efficiency. - Reactor Database --- similar to the iaeas PRIS but focused on reactor development rather than power reactors. Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery. reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

Anyway, a long way of saying awesome - would love to be on your list.  I'll send you an email separately. reply",

It's one of the few open source projects (besides Blender and GIMP) that is used directly by non-technical end-users and that has managed to surpass its commercial brethren , both in features and popularity. This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use). The situation has gotten better since then, Windows now comes with Narrator, which is... usable, but NVDA is still the top contender for most (non-enterprise) use cases.

I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort. Side note: I am worried about robots, and am actively looking for a project that could make robot OS or components or the AI/brain that drives them, more human and less harmful.

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States.

At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators.

Even if I only listen to the song a couple times it feels good knowing 80% of the money is going straight to talented artists and 20% is going to a beacon of hope on the internet.

Once I get the framework to the point where anyone can try it out, I hope to then go through and understand every freaking line of code, and expand it from there. You're not alone in the desire to grok everything you write. There's a lot of power in that knowledge. Then I'll re-implement it in Turbo Pascal under MS-DOS... just to prove a point. ;-) [1] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu... reply",

          "text": "I find LLMs 100x more productive for greenfield work. If I want to create a React app with X amount of pages, some Redux stores, Auth, etc. then it can smash that out in minutes. I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

It gets stuck in loops (removing and adding the same code/concept), it gets hung up on simple errors, etc. For greenfield it’s amazing, no doubt, but unless you are watching it very closely and approving/reviewing the code along the way it will go off the rails. At a certain point it’s easier to add the new feature or make the modification yourself. Even if the LLM could do it, it would burn tons of money and time. I expect things to get better, this will not always be the state of things, but for now “vibe coding” (specifically not reviewing/writing code yourself) is not sustainable. Most people doing it have a github profile that is a mile wide and a meter deep. LLM’s are amazing and useful, but “vibe coding” with them is not sustainable currently. reply",

It will not. And I say this as someone whose been building internal LLM tools since 2021. The issue is their context window. If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

Create tickets in the appropriate BACKLOG directory\n2. Use standard templates from .templates/ticket_template.md\n3. Set status to *Status: BACKLOG* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ### Updating Tickets 1. Move tickets to the appropriate status directory when status changes\n2. Update the status indicator in the main ticket file\n3. Update the \"Last Updated\" date when making significant changes\n4. Document progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md\n5. Check off completed tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ### Completing Tickets 1. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met\n2. Move the ticket to the COMPLETED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: COMPLETED*\n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file\n5. Create a completion summary in the main ticket file ### Abandoning Tickets 1. Document reasons for abandonment\n2. Move to COMPLETED/ABANDONED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: ABANDONED* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ## Ticket Linking When referencing other tickets, use relative links with appropriate paths: markdown\n@TICKET_NAME Ensure all links are updated when tickets change status. ## Ticket Cleanup and Streamlining ### When to Streamline Tickets Tickets should be streamlined and cleaned up at major transition points to maintain focus on remaining work: 1. *Major Phase Transitions* - When moving between phases (e.g., from implementation to testing)\n2. *Milestone Achievements* - After completing significant portions of work (e.g., 80%+ complete)\n3. *Infrastructure Readiness* - When moving from setup/building to operational phases\n4. *Team Handoffs* - When different team members will be taking over the work ### What to Streamline *Replace Historical Implementation Details With:*\n- Brief completed tasks checklist ( high-level achievements)\n- Current status summary\n- Forward-focused remaining work *Remove or Simplify:*\n- Detailed session-by-session progress logs\n- Extensive implementation decision histories\n- Verbose research findings documentation\n- Historical status updates and coordination notes ### Why Streamline Tickets 1. *Git History Preservation* - All detailed progress, decisions, and implementation details are preserved in git commits\n2. *Clarity for Future Work* - Makes it easier to quickly understand \"what needs to be done next\"\n3. *Team Efficiency* - Anyone picking up the work can immediately see current state and next steps\n4. *Maintainability* - Shorter, focused tickets are easier to read, understand, and keep updated ### How to Streamline 1. *Archive Detailed Progress* - Historical implementation details are preserved in git history\n2. *Create Completion Summary* - Replace detailed progress with a brief \"What's Complete\" checklist\n3. *Focus on Remaining Work* - Make current and future phases the primary content\n4. *Update Status Sections* - Keep status concise and action-oriented\n5. *Preserve Essential Context* - Keep architectural decisions, constraints, and key requirements *Goal*: Transform tickets from \"implementation logs\" into \"actionable work plans\" while preserving essential context. ## Maintenance Requirements 1. Keep the TICKET_INDEX.md file up to date\n2. Update \"Last Updated\" dates when making significant changes\n3. Ensure all ticket files follow the standardized format\n4. Include links between related tickets in both directions ## Complete Documentation For detailed instructions on working with tickets, refer to: - @Ticket Workflow Guide\n- @Ticket Index\n- @Tickets README ``` reply",

LLM doesn’t have a standardized directory structure, so you end up with different projects having different structures and file naming conventions. This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code.

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

It’s valuable to have it talk through something or explain why something is designed a certain way. So it’s definitely helped me grow as an engineer. But I have not come close to being 2x as productive, I don’t think my workload would be done by 2 people in the pre-LLM era. Maybe 1.25? Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords??

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often.

Then came things like SO, and that was a step more productive. I find LLMs to be another step forward, but not like a quantum leap or anything. Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

          "text": "There are a lot of terms in software development that have been co-opted from other disciplines and misrepresent a lot of development work, including 'engineering' and 'architecture'. I think it's helpful to think of engineering as a _process_ instead of a role, and the reality is that a lot of development work doesn't necessarily rely on the strong engineering methodology (e.g. measurement, material properties, tolerances, modelling, etc.) that the people developing the software might imagine just based on the number of job adverts for 'engineers'. This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs. (Unless you're writing software for launching rockets, in which case the engineering _process_ porbably should be strong). reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

Yet, I’ve tried to build a game and despite it appearing to work, it eventually has gotten confused about its own codebase and I end up with a ball of spaghetti  where requirements of yesterday get lost or broken when adding functionality today. It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch. I find this easier than the Cursor roll back or being overly cautious with suggested edits. I’m just getting to this realization so tbd if it works well. FYI, I’m good at programming generally but game dev is my Achilles. We’ll see how it it goes. reply",

Let's face it \"prompt engineering\" is a synonym for \"I have to waste time coming up with hacky workarounds to make this dumb LLM come up with something usable\". In the end, its always quicker and easier to do it myself.  And unless you are fresh out of school, if you've got more than 10 minutes of coding experience, you will always do a better job than the LLM.

I'm sick and tired of LLMs inventing functions that have been available in stdlib for years. I'm sick and tired of LLMs generating useless code with boilerplate subfunctions that just contain a single commented \"implement it yourself\" line.

          "text": "If you are burned out on AI, web, and SaaS, there's never been a better or more exciting time to get into using 3D printing, other types of home manufacturing, and embedded electronics to build real, physical devices. Hardware is no longer \"scary\" - it's almost as easy as web dev now. 3D CAD software like Autodesk Fusion is quick and relatively easy to learn. 3D printers have fully transitioned from crazy nerd toys to affordable, reliable, easy-to-use devices for building real products. Laser cutters, CNC machines, etc., have gotten more accessible than ever. Embedded electronics platforms like ESP32s make it cheap and easy to build real products with modern features even if you don't know any electronics. You can literally go on Amazon, order a fully self-contained ESP32 dev board with an embedded screen, wifi, usb-c, etc, for $15, design and 3D print an enclosure for it, and use ChatGPT to write a skeleton application for it in seconds. Without pulling out a soldering iron, you can have a GUI-driven custom device for tens of dollars. And if you don't have a 3D printer already, you can get a great one now for sub-$300. All in for $350 and a weekend or two of learning, you can be building custom hardware. If you are feeling tired of programming but have always thought of hardware as something too far outside of your comfort zone or too much work to mess with, it really has changed. It's a lot of fun. Check it out! reply",

          "text": "Software Defined Radio (SDR) is amazingly cheap to dip your toes into. For about $40 you can get a little kit of a receiver, and a few antenna that can listen to almost all local transmissions, radio, aircraft, navigation, ham radio, etc. GNU Radio is the toolkit that can let you do almost anything with it, using a GUI front end. With FreeCAD and a 3d printer, you can make almost anything, including gears, which I'm especially interested in. With the Arduino IDE, you can program a huge swath of controllers to build almost any control system you need for projects using the above tools. Gage Blocks are magical, you can spend $200ish, and have precision measured in microns. All of the above can be leveraged to do almost anything thanks to youtube, and all the people sharing their hobbies. If you want to measure micrograms cheap, or make almost atomically flat surfaces, etc... there's likely more than a few tutorials on the subject. Thanks to the internet, you could run your own forum, or use an existing one, to meet up with others interested in any given subject. reply",

AI has its place, but I am also tired of all the AI slop.  That's why we're partnering with creators who have already been producing excellent content to build courses on Emurse. reply",

          "text": "I used to blog Four Short Links for O’Reilly Media — every day, four interesting technical things around the net that caught my eye or seemed to be part of a bigger trend. I have a Real Job now but still collect interesting links. Here’s my 2024 list, from before I got interested in AI. Perhaps some of that is interesting to you, and New To Me is almost as good as New To The World right? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9pK6EYiJvRlBDdlIoNQCOkV... I admit that I’m no longer trawling with a wide net. Interesting to me professionally and interesting to me based on what I already know are weighting that list heavily. They’re pretty “adjacent possible” is what I’m saying. Beyond those, the trends I’d be watching are: * Apple took chip design in house and the results are incredible. I’d be watching for other companies following suit, which industries/players does it make most sense for, are there any low hanging fruits in this world, what does it do for hiring, and then downstream for education? * Quantum Computing is still in the physics phase of research. There are bullshit artists, claims and counter claims. I’d be trying to take a position on whether national security is the biggest driver or whether there’s commercial investment logic yet. Does NatSec tech even matter in an age of Doge? The technical advances themselves are still coming slowly. There was a Queensland U podcast that I followed for a while, and I’d dive in by looking for its spiritual successor. * correctly implementing distributed systems seems like a rich company’s achievement because of the teams and systems required. I’m watching for systems that let teams of 8 build an “enterprise” product that can survive network and software outages without a massive ops team and platform engineers and and and * AR/VR fizzled as virtual escapism and The Next Big Things. I’m interested in moving beyond physical monitors. Is it possible? Is it healthy? The VR advocates sneer at “just looking at monitors fixed in space”. That seems like low hanging fruit given I walk around offices full of monitors every day. I want to understand why we still have physical monitors and look for ways to replace them. * privacy. Capitalism drove investment and development of ever more tracking and data exfiltration. I’d be looking for intermediaries like PiHole as ways civilians can limit tracking and exfiltration. Bit screwed for phones when every app is phoning home with fingerprints and metadata galore. Advances in this area excite me, as tech bandaids before the regulation that is the only way the big players will get reined in. I don’t know enough about fab techniques to pay attention to nanometres news, but I do know the political topsy turvy will  be interesting there in terms of who develops, protects, and houses advances in chip manufacturing. Space tech doesn’t interest me. Med tech does but it’s very hard to separate press release hype from substance and then to understand the future based on that substance. No medical degree and too old to pack a PhD from ChatGPT U into my noggin. I like my job but I miss being in a place where people would pitch me to get me excited by their tech and businesses and vision of the future. Tim O’Reilly’s “create more value than you capture” was my first filter, and it was good to have a source of excitement and optimism from what passed that. I reckon we all could do with a little more of that. reply",

          "text": "Interacting with LLMs or AI APIs sounds like other software patterns, it doesn't matter that its AI or an LLM really, you are calling a function and providing inputs and expecting output. You get better output when your inputs are tuned to the scenario. Some of your inputs in this paradigm could be considered as optional parameters because you still get output without them. If you need to remember parts of the inputs in between user sessions then you need to save state of those somewhere to a disk. Databases are a common choice especially in web development but you could also just put things in a file. Another option if this isn't a web development context is to use something like sqlite since it will help organize the data a little better than say CSVs or similar. reply",

          "text": "Proper usage of LLMs so you don't just flood them with useless context will just be custom tailored prompts that only include the pertinent context, with prompts saying how it's related to what you're looking for. I don't think there's a cheap way around it maybe on the plus side you can tune them using ai code. \nI think tools are really over used and over-rated and have had horrible experience with them, nothing beats just custom tailoring stuff and setting up a system around it. What I do is use elixir pheonix, have a genserver keep track of the user state and I just include the related state in the request and just helper functions to generate the related prompts per type of state/context and append them wherever makes the most sense. I think LLMs make most sense to be viewed of as singular atomic interactions where you have the whole input (prompt/context/data) and get a concrete output. Everything else just seems like people being lazy trying to avoid thinking about the best way of structuring it. Where you put the context/data and how you include it will vary per prompt or the specific atomic interaction, there is no standard rule each interaction is unique. You have to experiment and see what provides the best output for each kind of request. I'd read Anthropics prompting docs if you haven't it's very good. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-... My way of thinking is just viewing every isolated LLM request as a unique function that is\nthe prompt + llm = a unique function\nContext is just what data you pass into the function (prompt+llm+settings(temp, etc))(data) to get whatever specific output you want. The prompt includes prewriting user/system messages, system prompt, structured output stuff or whatever. Any single request might lead to 1 or 30 of these that feed back into each other. \nBut yeah based on that it depends on just custom tailoring them for anything, it's pretty conceptual and intellectual but I find it fun but I don't think there's any easy way around it. Having the ability to have all your requests be stateful and modify what goes into the prompt based on the current user state (like genservers/elixir makes very easy) is a nice technical thing that helps though. reply",

          "text": "Depends on what you want to do. But my 2 cents are that like all new technology, LLMs will become a commodity. Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

          "text": "LLMs already are a commodity. Google has already kicked off the competitive price wars.  Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

There was also a dot com bubble, mostly bursting not because of search but because there were a lot of what today would be \"AI startup\" but is just a web app calling AI Api's.

We save a lot of manual time where we used to have to resolve unknown documents. The LLM can help fill out missing data, too. It's all stored as annotations so it's clear who/what edited the data.

Learn basic NNs at a simple level, build from scratch (no frameworks) a feed forward neural network with back propagation to train against MNIST or something as simple. Understand every part of it. Just use your favorite programming language. 2. Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy. This is just some useful technology surrounded by a lot of hype of all the people that want to get rich with AI and understand they can't compete with the LLMs themselves. So they pump the part that can be kinda \"productized\". Never forget that the product is the neural network itself, for the most part. reply",

A full-stack engineer will likely have at least a solid understanding of the HTTP protocol, HTTPS, WebSockets, the interface layer between the frontend server and their chosen Web webdev stack, and so on. Then a more general understanding of networking protocols, TCP vs UDP, DNS, routing, etc. In general, you need to have a solid understanding of the layer below where you're working, some understanding of the layer below that, and so on, less and less detail needed for each layer down. (That's not to say that you shouldn't bother with learning more -- more knowledge is always good -- or that the OP specifically only knows that. It's more a sensible minimum.) My own \"curriculum\" for that has been Jeremy Howard's Fast AI course and Sebastian Raschka's book \"build an LLM from scratch\".  Still working through it, but once I'm done I think I'll be solid on your point 2 above.

Or do you think they're good enough now that they will transform the way software is built and software engineers work, with just better tooling? I've tried to keep up with them somewhat, and dabble with Claude Code and have personal subscriptions to Gemini and ChatGPT as well. They're impressive and almost magical, but I can't help but feel they're not quite there yet . My company is making a big AI push, as are so many companies, and it feels like no one wants to be \"left behind\" when they \"really take off\".

I’ve noticed that Gemini 2.5 Pro seems way dumber when used in the Copilot agent, vs me just running all the required context through OpenRouter in Continue.dev. The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

Even if this is a bubble, and even if (when?) it bursts, the underlying tech is not going anywhere. Just like the last dotcom bubble gave us FAANG+, so will this give us the next letters. Sure, agentsdotcom or flowsdotcom or ragdotcom might fail (likely IMO), but the stack is here to stay, and it's only gonna get better, cheaper, more integrated. What is becoming increasingly clear, IMO, is that you have to spend some time with this. Prompting an LLM is like the old google-fu. You need to gain experience with it, to make the most out of it. Same with coding stacks. There are plenty of ways to use what's available now, as \"tools\". Play around, see what they can do for you now, see where it might lead.

The first group is definitely not hype. Their core business relies on ML and they don’t need hype for that to be true. For the second group, it depends on the business model. The fact that you can make an API call doesn’t mean anything. What matters is solving a customer problem. I also (selfishly) believe a lot of the second group will hire folks to train faster and more personalized models once their business models are proven. reply",

          "text": "I think about this a lot. If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking. That’s my 2 cents, shredded, not sliced. reply",

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

          "text": "Both are tough. 1/ There aren't many jobs in this space. There are still far more companies (and roles) that need 'full-stack development' than those focused on 'AI/LLM internals.' With low demand for AI internals and a high supply of talent—many people have earned data science certificates in AI hoping to land lucrative jobs at OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.—the bar for accessing these few roles is very high. 2/ The risk here is AI makes everyone good at full-stack. This means more competition for roles, less demand for roles (now 1 in-experienced engineer with AI, can output 1.5x the code an experience Senior engineer could do in 2020). In the short/medium term, 2/ has the best risk/reward function. But 1/ is more future proof. Another important question is where are you in your career? If you're 45 years old, I'd encourage you to switch into leadership roles for 2/. This wont be replaced by AI. If you're early in your career, it could make more sense to switch. reply",

Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

I'm able to get changes out of it, that mostly make sense, but you really need to take whatever personal guidelines you have for coding and \"encode\" them into the AGENTS.md, and really focus on asking the right question/request changes in the right way. Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

It's an open source web framework I have been working  on ( https://github.com/adamritter/pageql ). To tell you the truth it slowed down yesterday as most of the features were done and I had to fix memory/signal/callback leaks, but even that was done much faster than if I did it by hand. I had done coding on my phone while buying flowers in a gardening store, in my bed waking up without getting out my laptop etc... so yeah,  it's not for those people who take the 8 hour work day strictly. reply",

          "text": "LLMs are part of soft-computing, i.e. contrary to traditional (algortihm-based) computing sometimes things won't get the right result (or, just as bad, the right result in the wrong format). Engineering solutions with LLM is a lot of fiddling,\nwhich is experimental rather than analytical/logical. It is worth getting use to that mind-set, and then use LLMs as a tool (they are likely here to stay, because big tech have started to integrate features based on them everywhere, for better or worse). So this is your option (2.). Personally, I prefer software I use NOT to be smart, but to be 100% deterministic. But already my favorite LaTeX authoring environment (Overleaf) has a button pop up called \"fix this\" that auto-resolves syntax errors, many of which overwhelm my doctoral students that no longer read books end-to-end (here, to learn LaTeX). Gradually, you may dive deeper into the \"how\", driven by either need or curiosity, so eventually you will probably have done both (2.) and (1.). - in the same way that you will have first learned SQL before learning how replication, transactions, data buffers and caches, or query optimizers are implemented. reply",

Sure, it is good to know how some of the things work under the good, but you can be perfectly capable developer by reading docs and knowing how to use tools - without needing to know how to write them or how they do complex things under the hood. Take databases as example, network stack, etc. Just because a field is popular, doesn't mean you should switch to going deep into it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it - it costs a few dollars to try it out and see whether it fits your workflow. If it does, this is great and you can be more productive and focus on stuff that you can solve and LLM can't, but if it doesn't, that is fine too. reply",

Say I want to read a book, but I'd like a synopsis to go deeper or search something in a book it references. Obsidian would be great for this, as well as some book MCP. Piotr Wozniak discovered spaced repetition and incremental learning, but the tools for incremental learning were never good enough – it was internet explorer hacked to take notes. Obsidian made a good attempt. MCPs might just be the missing bit to get there. reply",

There are a bunch of good picks; for example: > DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B - https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B Released today; probably the best reasoning model in 8B size. > Qwen3 - https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-67dd247413f0e2... Recently released. Hybrid thinking/non-thinking models with really great performance and plethora of sizes for every hardware. The Qwen3-30B-A3B can even run on CPU with acceptable speeds. Even the tiny 0.6B one is somewhat coherent, which is crazy. reply",

Something that is more accurate but put in a boring way will often be downvoted, while straight up incorrect but funny/emotional/\"fitting the group think\" comments usually get upvoted. For us who've spent a lot of time on the web, this sort of bullshit detector is basically built-in at this point, but if you're new to places where the group think is so heavy as on reddit, it's worth being careful taking anything at face value. reply",

With 16GB one can do partial DDR5 offloading with llama.cpp and run anything up to about 30B (even dense) or even more at a \"reasonable\" speed for chat purposes. Especially with tensor offload. I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards. Gemma 3s are great but a bit unhinged. And of course QwQ when you need GPT4 at home. And probably lots of others I'm forgetting. reply",

It's really hard to say one model is better than another in a general way, since it depends on so many things like your use case, the prompts, the settings, quantization, quantization method and so on. If you're building/trying to build stuff depending on LLMs in any capacity, the first step is coming up with your own custom benchmark/evaluation that you can run with your specific use cases being put under test.

In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

Up to a point more params is better than worrying about quantization. But eventually you'll hit a compute wall with high params. KV cache quantization is awesome (I use q4 for a 32k context with a 1080ti!) and context shifting is also awesome for long conversations/stories/games. I was using ooba but found recently that KoboldCPP not only runs faster for the same model/settings but also Kobold's context shifting works much more consistently than Ooba's \"streaming_llm\" option, which almost always re-evaluates the prompt when hooked up to something like ST. reply",

          "text": "Very rougly you can consider the Bs of a model as GBs of memory then it depends on the quantization level. Say for an 8B model: - FP16: 2x 8GB = 16GB - Q8: 1x 8GB - Q4: 0.5x 8GB = 4GB It doesn't 100% neatly map like this but this gives you a rough measure. In top of this you need some more memory depending on the context length and some other stuff. Rationale for the calculation above: A model is basically a billions of variables with a floating number value. So the size of a model roughly maps to number of variables (weights) x word-precision of each variable (4, 8, 16bits..) You don't have to quantize all layers to the same precision this is why sometimes you see fractional quantizations like 1.58bits. reply",

More complex packing arrangements are done by grouping weights together (e.g. a group of 3) and assigning a bit configuration to each combination of values into a lookup table.

          "text": "Ollama[0] has a collection of models that are either already small or quantized/distilled, and come with hyperparameters that are pretty reasonable, and they make it easy to try them out. I recommend you install it and just try a bunch because they all have different \"personalities\", different strengths and weaknesses. My personal go-tos are: Qwen3 family from Alibaba seem to be the best reasoning models that fit on local hardware right now. Reasoning models on local hardware are annoying in contexts where you just want an immediate response, but vastly outperform non-reasoning models on things where you want the model to be less naive/foolish. Gemma3 from google is really good at intuition-oriented stuff, but with an obnoxious HR Boy Scout personality where you basically have to add \"please don't add any disclaimers\" to the system prompt for it to function. Like, just tell me how long you think this sprain will take to heal, I already know you are not a medical professional, jfc. Devstral from Mistral performs the best on my command line utility where I describe the command I want and it executes that for me (e.g. give me a 1-liner to list the dotfiles in this folder and all subfolders that were created in the last month). Nemo from Mistral, I have heard (but not tested) is really good for routing-type jobs, where you need something with to make a simple multiple-choice decision competently with low latency, and is easy to fine-tune if you want to get that sophisticated.

Years ago,  before BERT and all that,  I worked on a search engine for patents where you could give it a paragraph describing an invention and it would use a combination of document embeddings and probability-based full text search to find matching patent and non-patent literature. Today's embeddings (see SBERT) are much better than what we had back then and I bet if you had a database of company descriptions, maybe articles about them, you could write a paragraph about your business and find competitors. reply",

Takes a data structure (usually a list) and evaluates it as Lisp code. Example: (eval '(+ 1 2)) ; => 3 Use case: Dynamically construct and run code while the program is running. Macros Runs at compile time (or macro-expansion time). Transform Lisp code before it's evaluated. They return new code (a Lisp form) to be compiled/evaluated later. Example:\n(defmacro my-unless (condition body)\n  `(if (not ,condition) ,body)) (my-unless (= 1 2) (print \"Not equal\")) ; expands to (if (not (= 1 2)) (print ...)) Use case: Extend the language by defining new syntactic constructs. Enables powerful DSLs and optimizations. reply",

For a single Mac where you want reproducible, just use shell script(s). Anyway, for my Ansible environment for servers and network devices, I use uv[1]. It works flawlessly. If I were doing things even more right, I'd host it in a container, but I don't have time for all that right now. And nobody's mentioned Homebrew[2], yet.

I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

Also curious if there are any parts of the industry you think are particularly exciting and/or neglected (ex. there was just a startup that raised gobs of money to enrich HALEU since most of it used to come from Russia) reply",

The UAE is probably the biggest most recent example of what has to be done to set up the legal and regulatory pathway and then move into good technical execution. I think they did it really well; bringing in experts to help, choosing a well-understood tried-and-true design rather than a cutting edge Gen IV never-before-tried technology, building 4 in a row rather than just one. Of course that all takes an absurd amount of capital. I think the most neglected thing in the nuclear industry is the ABWR design. It's a good-enough boiling water reactor that Hitachi was able to construct with record-breaking speed. The IAEA is the best place to start.

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

Video recommendations that have a banned word in the title/desc don't get displayed e.g. MrBeast, anything with Minecraft in it, never gets surfaced.

I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort.

This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use). The situation has gotten better since then, Windows now comes with Narrator, which is... usable, but NVDA is still the top contender for most (non-enterprise) use cases.

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

At their current level of importance, they need to be progressives, not revolutionaries. They essentially took up arms against the industry using covid as an excuse. Well, I personally despise the IP industry and think that it needs radical reform, if not complete destruction, we have to live to fight another day as well. Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States. The whole point of copyright and other protections was to ensure that there was some incentive to people to produce content and be able to monetize it. I think it's ludicrous to suggest that you need such an utterly long period with a shark full of teeth to go after people in order to incentivize the producing of content. reply",

At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators.

Their library has so many fascinating esoteric works—on alchemy, spiritual practices, Neoplatonic philosophy, natural magic, etc. But, 80% of the library hasn’t been digitized or translated. This digitization and translation is what I’m supporting — and making the works accessible to AI (and through AI). I somehow feel very motivated to make sure that the intellectual works that inspired the Renaissance, European Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution are accessible, both to people and for LLM pretraining. reply",

Want to integrate with existing tools like Linear or Notion or JIRA or even email inboxes or Slack messages? Add entities for Incidents, that automatically make a dedicated Slack channel when you create them? Want proper 1:1 or 1:manu or many:many links between Tasks and Milestones and Sprints and Incidents and Teams and Components and whatever? Want single assignees? Or multiple ones? Want flexible custom reports on all of it? Or just want a simple flat Todo list, that can evolve later to fit your needs?

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

At a certain point it’s easier to add the new feature or make the modification yourself. Even if the LLM could do it, it would burn tons of money and time. I expect things to get better, this will not always be the state of things, but for now “vibe coding” (specifically not reviewing/writing code yourself) is not sustainable.

It will not. And I say this as someone whose been building internal LLM tools since 2021. The issue is their context window. If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

          "text": "> For greenfield it’s amazing I'll preface this comment with: I am a recent startup owner (so only dev, which is important) and my entire codebase has been generated via Sonnet (mostly 3.7, now using 4.0). If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

All team members should follow these guidelines when creating, updating, or completing tickets. ## Ticket Organization Tickets are organized by status and area in the following structure: TICKETS/\n  COMPLETED/       - Finished tickets\n    BACKEND/       - Backend-related tickets\n    FRONTEND/      - Frontend-related tickets\n  IN_PROGRESS/     - Tickets currently being worked on\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/\n  BACKLOG/         - Tickets planned but not yet started\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/ ## Ticket Status Indicators All tickets must use consistent status indicators: -  *BACKLOG* - Planned but not yet started\n-  *IN_PROGRESS* - Currently being implemented\n-  *COMPLETED* - Implementation is finished\n-  *ABANDONED* - Work was stopped and will not continue ## Required Ticket Files Each ticket directory must contain these files: 1. *Main Ticket File* (TICKET_ .md):\n   - Problem statement and background\n   - Detailed analysis\n   - Implementation plan\n   - Acceptance criteria 2. *Implementation Plan* (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):\n   - Detailed breakdown of tasks\n   - Timeline estimates\n   - Success metrics 3. *Implementation Progress* (IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md):\n   - Status updates\n   - Issues encountered\n   - Decisions made 4. *Design Documentation* (DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md), when relevant:\n   - Architecture recommendations\n   - Code patterns and examples\n   - Error handling strategies 5. *API Documentation* (API_DOCUMENTATION.md), when applicable:\n   - Interface definitions\n   - Usage examples\n   - Configuration options ## Ticket Workflow Rules ### Creating Tickets 1. Create tickets in the appropriate BACKLOG directory\n2. Use standard templates from .templates/ticket_template.md\n3. Set status to *Status: BACKLOG* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ### Updating Tickets 1. Move tickets to the appropriate status directory when status changes\n2. Update the status indicator in the main ticket file\n3. Update the \"Last Updated\" date when making significant changes\n4. Document progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md\n5. Check off completed tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ### Completing Tickets 1. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met\n2. Move the ticket to the COMPLETED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: COMPLETED*\n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file\n5. Create a completion summary in the main ticket file ### Abandoning Tickets 1. Document reasons for abandonment\n2. Move to COMPLETED/ABANDONED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: ABANDONED* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ## Ticket Linking When referencing other tickets, use relative links with appropriate paths: markdown\n@TICKET_NAME Ensure all links are updated when tickets change status. ## Ticket Cleanup and Streamlining ### When to Streamline Tickets Tickets should be streamlined and cleaned up at major transition points to maintain focus on remaining work: 1. *Major Phase Transitions* - When moving between phases (e.g., from implementation to testing)\n2. *Milestone Achievements* - After completing significant portions of work (e.g., 80%+ complete)\n3. *Infrastructure Readiness* - When moving from setup/building to operational phases\n4. *Team Handoffs* - When different team members will be taking over the work ### What to Streamline *Replace Historical Implementation Details With:*\n- Brief completed tasks checklist ( high-level achievements)\n- Current status summary\n- Forward-focused remaining work *Remove or Simplify:*\n- Detailed session-by-session progress logs\n- Extensive implementation decision histories\n- Verbose research findings documentation\n- Historical status updates and coordination notes ### Why Streamline Tickets 1. *Git History Preservation* - All detailed progress, decisions, and implementation details are preserved in git commits\n2. *Clarity for Future Work* - Makes it easier to quickly understand \"what needs to be done next\"\n3. *Team Efficiency* - Anyone picking up the work can immediately see current state and next steps\n4. *Maintainability* - Shorter, focused tickets are easier to read, understand, and keep updated ### How to Streamline 1. *Archive Detailed Progress* - Historical implementation details are preserved in git history\n2. *Create Completion Summary* - Replace detailed progress with a brief \"What's Complete\" checklist\n3. *Focus on Remaining Work* - Make current and future phases the primary content\n4. *Update Status Sections* - Keep status concise and action-oriented\n5. *Preserve Essential Context* - Keep architectural decisions, constraints, and key requirements *Goal*: Transform tickets from \"implementation logs\" into \"actionable work plans\" while preserving essential context. ## Maintenance Requirements 1. Keep the TICKET_INDEX.md file up to date\n2. Update \"Last Updated\" dates when making significant changes\n3. Ensure all ticket files follow the standardized format\n4. Include links between related tickets in both directions ## Complete Documentation For detailed instructions on working with tickets, refer to: - @Ticket Workflow Guide\n- @Ticket Index\n- @Tickets README ``` reply",

Hell, only engineers know that the devil is in the details. Quick example: let’s say a Contact Us page needs to be built. There are tons of details that need to be accounted for and the LLM may skip them if it is not told about them: where does the data of the form go to? A backend endpoint? What about captcha? What about analytics? What about validation of specific fields? What about the friendly URL? And disabling the button after sending to prevent duplicate requests?

LLM doesn’t have a standardized directory structure, so you end up with different projects having different structures and file naming conventions. This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

I see no benefit in using a low-IQ autocomplete tool to automate a small part of the remaining 10% of the job, the easiest and most enjoyable part in fact. Personally I find most of coding I do is unsuitable for LLMs anyway, because I don't need them to regurgitate standard logic when libraries are available, so most of that 10% is writing business logic tailored for the program/client. Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code. Less is more, and I appreciate programming-as-an-art rather than being a code monkey paid by the line of code I commit.

          "text": "Sorry for the late reply here, but let me develop a bit more what I meant. I have a long and vast programming experience, but am also an entrepreneur with many projects that I switch between. I could have focused full-time on, say, React Native, and then I could churn out my monkey code all day long. But I don't spend full-time on RN and then suddenly 12 months passed where I didn't write any at all so my specific knowledge of that domain is always a bit behind. But something like o4-mini-high is a domain expert in all versions of React, Redux, RN etc. and knows every internal SDK change over the last 10 years (or goes out and reads the changelogs and code itself). Countless times I've had it port old code to new and it figures it out 100%. It formulates good modern canonical ways to solve stuff. It knows all the stupid tricks you have to do to get RN stuff run well on Android and iOS that I would never be able to keep in my head unless I work full-time on that. And it does the eye-watering boring styling code that nobody likes, you can even just upload a screenshot of another app or a sketch on paper and it will correctly output code for the style in a matter of seconds. The end result is that I can, without investing a full-time of keeping myself current, do a professional RN dual Android/iOS app development cycle because I have the general skill to understand what to ask it and how to merge its output properly. This leaves me time to do other stuff and generally be more productive. My guess is that many who gave up on the AI coding stuff tried the bad tools like the default chatgpt 4o-mini (or tried the tools available 2 years ago) and got a bad experience. There are light-years of differences between these and something like o4-mini-high. TL;DR: use the correct model for the job, and it doesn't really need to be an argument - if it makes you more productive it's a good tool, if it doesn't, nobody is forcing you to use it. But I don't think you should imply that everybody who likes these tools are stupid. reply",

For example the price of outsourcing app development is really coming down now because it's one of the areas where the AI coding tools really excel. It's a lot of boiler-plate style code, pretty canonical stuff, no rocket science and, to be frank, not really that much that has to be clever. You can give the tools a screenshot of an UI and it gladly outputs correct styling code for it in seconds. It supercharges already skilled developers. And if you needed 6 in-house app developers before, now you only need 2. It isn't an immediate effect, but it is an effect that is slowly going to run though the business. The question is, are companies going to use fewer people to do the same, or the same amount of people and just create better products? For prototyping new ideas this is also an invaluable turbocharge for startups who can't really afford to have hordes of developers trying out alternative solutions. reply",

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

It’s valuable to have it talk through something or explain why something is designed a certain way. So it’s definitely helped me grow as an engineer. But I have not come close to being 2x as productive, I don’t think my workload would be done by 2 people in the pre-LLM era. Maybe 1.25? Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords?? These things are going to drive us all absolutely insane I can guarantee it. The logical end of this is complete madness. reply",

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

A product is more than just code, and a company is more than their headcount. There is domain knowledge about the product and market. There is the personal ability of the workers and the synergy coming with, also the strength of established structures grown over years and decades. Just the habit and trust of users is a big fortress every new product has to conquer. That's not something some random dev or team of devs can easily reach just by being 100 times faster. And realistically, there is also the question of where this claim is coming from. Someone being 100 times faster with AI is probably not starting from a place of high competence. Of the 100x, 90x are probably just for filling the gap to peak devs. So at the end they would be probably as productive as a highly competent dev of some domain, just that they can more easily access any domain without years of experience in that domain.

That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand.

I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch.

          "text": "> And those who, like you, find it to be an extremely finicky process that requires extreme amount of coddling to get average results at best. I am very much in that category. I would describe my experience as the old adage \"why keep a dog and bark yourself\". And no, I don't buy into people who say you have to engage in \"prompt engineering\".  That's bullshit.  Let's face it \"prompt engineering\" is a synonym for \"I have to waste time coming up with hacky workarounds to make this dumb LLM come up with something usable\". In the end, its always quicker and easier to do it myself.  And unless you are fresh out of school, if you've got more than 10 minutes of coding experience, you will always do a better job than the LLM. Every time a new LLM model comes out, I fall into the same old trap \"oh well, this one must be better, surely\" I say to myself. And yet its always the same \"you can't polish a turd but you can roll it in glitter\" experience. I'm sick and tired of LLMs hallucinating shit. I'm sick and tired of LLMs inventing functions that have been available in stdlib for years. I'm sick and tired of LLMs generating useless code with boilerplate subfunctions that just contain a single commented \"implement it yourself\" line. On top of that LLMs are simply terrible for the environment, guzzling up all that electricity, producing nothing but hot air and bullshit results in return. Basically I'm sick and tired of LLMs and all the LLM fetishists that surround them. reply",

The area they will make a huge difference is in helping people work out issues faster. You know those multi-hour or multi-day issues you run into where you go crazy reading and re-reading the code. The LLMs are good at giving you a fresh look at the code that you'd otherwise need to get more people to help with or go sleep on it for a day.

I realize you're talking more about individuals , not necessarily who owns a company, but if we were to suppose that a non-US citizen were to become an employee of a company which works on some specific field (\"critical technologies, infrastructure, sensitive data, and specific real estate deals\") and that foreign employee was promoted to higher and higher roles, eventually being put into a position to hire other people from their country, that might trigger automatic CIFUS oversight review. It's not enough to simply have a company deemed as critical to be US-based; if the majority of its workforce is foreign nationals, that is a security (and economic) concern for the entire nation, and will come to attention of the US Government. Dealing with any US government bureaucracy is exhausting, but dealing with US government bureaucracy as it relates to national security is an entirely different beast. I also realize that \"90% of US-based companies\" might not currently fall under CIFUS oversight, but if a company expands or pivots into new markets, I would assume that the vast majority of US CEOs would not want to lose out on the opportunity to win an sweet Government contract - that would limit future growth.

I was working for an energy company who shall remain nameless, but who's internal IT was a tangle of external consultants milking the place for millions, and ineffective/underserved full time staff who couldn't run a query on a database without a change control committee of consultants milking them for yet more cash. Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage. Then, as far as I know, he sat back and just watched the money roll in while he automated everything else about the job. reply",

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

          "text": "This is of course true is some cases and less true in others. I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you. But I'm still happy to hang out here and get into (hopefully) illuminating discussions. reply",

I'd be shocked if they (you?) were banned just for critiquing Musk. So please link the post. I'm prepared to be shocked. I'm also pretty sure that I could make a throwaway account that only posted critiques of Musk (or about any single subject for that matter) and manage to keep it alive by making the critiques timely, on-topic and thoughtful or get it banned by being repetitive and unconstructive.

I think LLMs will find their uses, it just takes time to distil what they are really useful for vs what the AI companies are generating hype for.

It's really hard to say one model is better than another in a general way, since it depends on so many things like your use case, the prompts, the settings, quantization, quantization method and so on. If you're building/trying to build stuff depending on LLMs in any capacity, the first step is coming up with your own custom benchmark/evaluation that you can run with your specific use cases being put under test.

I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

          "text": "My $300 laptop is a few years old. It has a Ryzen 3 3200U CPU, it has a 14\" 1080p display, backlit keyboard. It came with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, I upgraded to 16GB from RAM acquired by a dumpster dive and a 256GB SSD for like $10 on clearance at Microcenter. I upgraded the WiFi to an Intel AX210 6e for about another $10 off Amazon. It gets 6-8 hours of battery life doing browsing and texting editing kind of workloads. The only thing that is itching me to get a new machine is it needs a 19V power supply. Luckily it's a pretty common barrel size, I already had several power cables laying around that work just fine. I'd prefer to just have all my portable devices to run off USB-C though. reply",

          "text": "I concur LocalLLama subreddit recommendation. Not in terms of choosing \"the best model\" but to answer questions, find guides, latest news and gossip, names of the tools, various models and how they stack against each other, etc. There's no one \"best\" model, you just try a few and play with parameters and see which one fits your needs the best. Since you're on HN, I'd recommend skipping Ollama and LMStudio. They might restrict access to the latest models and you typically only choose from the ones they tested with. And besides what kind of fun is this when you don't get to peek under the hood? llamacpp can do a lot itself, and you can do most recently released models (when changes are needed they adjust literally within a few days). You can get models from huggingface obviously. I prefer GGUF format, saves me some memory (you can use lower quantization, I find most 6-bit somewhat satisfactory). I find that the the size of the model's GGUF file with roughly tell me if it'll fit in my VRAM. For example 24Gb GGUF model will NOT fit in 16Gb, whereas 12Gb likely will. However, the more context you add the more RAM will be needed. Keep in mind that models are trained with certain context window. If it has 8Kb context (like most older models do) and you load it with 32Kb context it won't be much help. You can run llamacpp on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, you can get the binaries or compile on your local. It can split the model between VRAM and RAM (if the model doesn't fit in your 16Gb).  It even has simple React front-end (llamacpp-server). The same module provides REST service which has similar (but simpler) protocol to OpenAI and all the other \"big\" guys. Since it implements OpenAI REST API, it also works with a lot of front-end tools if you want more functionality (ie oobabooga aka textgeneration webui). Koboldcpp is another backend you can try if you find llamacpp to be too raw (I believe it's the still llamacpp under the hood). reply",

With Ollama I can set up my desktop as an LLM server, interact with it over WiFi from any other device, and let Ollama switch seamlessly between models as I want to swap. Unless something has changed recently, with llama.cpp's CLI you still have to shut it down and restart it with a different command line flag in order to switch models even when run in server mode. That kind of overhead gets in the way of experimentation and can also limit applications: there are some little apps I've built that rely on being able to quickly swap between a 1B and an 8B or 30B model by just changing the model parameter in the web request. reply",

          "text": "llamacpp can set up REST server with OpenAI API so you can get many front-end LLM apps to talk to it the same way they talk to ChatGPT, Claude, etc. And you can connect to that machine from another one on the same network through whatever port you set it to. See llamacpp-server. When you get Ollama to \"switch seamlessly\" between models it still simply reloads a different model with llamacpp which is what it's based on. I prefer llamacpp because doing things \"seamlessly\" obscures the way things work behind the scenes, which is what I want to learn and play with. Also, and I'm not sure if it's the case anymore but it used to be, when llamacpp gets adjusted to work with the latest model, sometimes it takes them a bit to update the Python API which is what Ollama is using. It was the case with one of the LlaMas, forget which one, where people said \"oh yeah don't try this model with Ollama, they're waiting on llamacpp folks to update llama-cpp-python to bring the latest changes from llamacpp, and once they do, Ollama will bring the latest into their app and we'll be up and running.

I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts.

I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder.

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

I have a few passion projects that I'm working on (between the somewhat substantial consulting work that came out of the woodwork): - Nuclear Reactor Starter Kit --- an open source set of procedures, processes, templates, and maybe even some IT advice that should help newcomers start companies with nuclear quality assurance programs easily and quickly while also making a new format in which nuclear companies can share lessons learned in efficiency. - Reactor Database --- similar to the iaeas PRIS but focused on reactor development rather than power reactors. Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery. reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort. Side note: I am worried about robots, and am actively looking for a project that could make robot OS or components or the AI/brain that drives them, more human and less harmful.

This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use).

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

At their current level of importance, they need to be progressives, not revolutionaries. They essentially took up arms against the industry using covid as an excuse. Well, I personally despise the IP industry and think that it needs radical reform, if not complete destruction, we have to live to fight another day as well. Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States. The whole point of copyright and other protections was to ensure that there was some incentive to people to produce content and be able to monetize it. I think it's ludicrous to suggest that you need such an utterly long period with a shark full of teeth to go after people in order to incentivize the producing of content. reply",

          "text": "NewPipe has a few features that I like, but let's be real: most people use NewPipe for the 'privacy' feature AKA: blocking ads. At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators. LTT actually did a good job explaining this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDsJJRNXjYI reply",

I somehow feel very motivated to make sure that the intellectual works that inspired the Renaissance, European Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution are accessible, both to people and for LLM pretraining. reply",

          "text": "They are subtly different. Macros are the only way to process s-expressions without first calling eval on them. This is necessary because without macros you could only generate and eval quoted code. Also practically it's cumbersome to work with everything being quoted when writing lisp code generators. Without macros you could implement eval still but your internal lisp implementation could only work on quoted s-expressions, there would be no way to get back to the base unquoted level of lisp code (assuming you can't use the primitive eval, since you're trying to implement lisp in lisp). Another use case is implementing a shortcutting boolean and function. You can't do the shortcutting without macros because all of the arguments get eval'd before passing to your and function. reply",

If I were doing things even more right, I'd host it in a container, but I don't have time for all that right now. And nobody's mentioned Homebrew[2], yet. PS: OS X is now called macOS, and at least in some parts, \"OS X\" is still used to refer to really old OS releases and may generate some confusion. 1. https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ 2. https://brew.sh/ reply",

The slowest part of everything is sales, so the team has some flexibility in exactly what order to do things when developing features, as a few days of tweaking designs won't actually impact revenue. Devs copy existing patterns from prior features, code things up, and design has time to ask for adjustments before it is released. The longer a product lives, the more patterns already exist that can be copied, the less design needs to come up with new patterns, and the devs can just roll. So if you have experienced design being a roadblock for years, and you are waiting on Figma for every feature... something is wonky. reply",

Even something like html5/modern web while it had tremendous impact on pop culture and what the mainstream expectation of a website is like in 2025 vs 2006, the mainstream culture never really cared or commented on it for obvious reasons.

It has very obvious limits - but the nature of every hype cycle is to ignore those limits and predict grandiose futures.

          "text": "> But remember how the internet was hyped in the 90s? Sure it'll change the world, but it's too early to predict how or when. But clearly we've entered a new era and if will be interesting to see how it plays out. Yes, I actually think we can have pretty good guess looking at how the internet evolved. It's really not how it was envisioned in the 90s. A lot of people knew it was gonna be big of course, but they couldn't tell you how. There is the type of applications/services the internet enabled, and how do you actually make monetize the internet. Google, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, etc all had different \"takes\" on how the internet was gonna be big and how they will monetize it. The actual services they provide are things that WAS correctly envisioned and was \"known\" in the 90s. I remember people talking about the \"future where you could have\": - On-Demand video streaming service - News, weather, and communication (email, IM, chat, video conference) services - Commerce You could go to videos from the 90s on YouTube and see many people (including Bill Gates himself) easily say \"One day you'll be doing all your shopping online. You can watch any movie in the world in a second. You can chat with your loved ones around the world in video in real time and send and receive messages from them instantaneously whenever and whereever you like. Everyone familiar with computers and networks knew that future was possible. It was a matter of timeline and when the technology/cost curves would cross for it to work. How you monetize that though wasn't exactly known/agreed on. Monetizing a commerce and paid services is straightforward, and you just need the technology to be ready for the scenario you wanted to achieve. Google on the other hand put all their cards on Ads for example. Microsoft initially thought they can just sell the software to run email or hosting for a web services, but they also dabbled in Ads, paid services (cloud and otherwise) Not sure what the similar verticals in AI will be. It's not Application vs Monetization. I think it's something else. reply",

Years ago,  before BERT and all that,  I worked on a search engine for patents where you could give it a paragraph describing an invention and it would use a combination of document embeddings and probability-based full text search to find matching patent and non-patent literature. Today's embeddings (see SBERT) are much better than what we had back then and I bet if you had a database of company descriptions, maybe articles about them, you could write a paragraph about your business and find competitors. reply",

I thrive on seeing others succeed with technology. This sounds like either a Sales Engineer, Technical Support Engineer, or Technical Account Manager. In other words technical roles that communicate directly with customers. Look for jobs with one of those titles or something similar. > What key skills (technical or soft) would be most beneficial to develop for such a pivot? Any advice on leveraging my current compliance background in this transition? Your resume paints a picture of who you are, you should be trying to paint the picture of someone highly skilled and experienced at communication and customer success. Accomplishments in your job history which highlight those (regardless of what your literal job title was) should be front and center. reply",

We started with three customers asking for the same services and found none that were really useful (and supported Chinese characters) on the market at that time. Lately the product pivoted to based on (fine-tuned) LLM/VLMs and focus on adding various features that LLM out of the box are missing (fine tune based on specific customers data, prompt tune for particular type of elements e.g. Checkboxes, split 100s pages of PDF into dozens of documents with a few pages) We're at around 55k MRR, the price model is per page, and we sign annual contracts with most clients (with some discounts) 2nd is an open-source CIAM [1]; Around 35k MRR. We knew nothing about marketing when we started, so we partnered with local GCP/Azure as an ISV to get our first paying customers, which drove us to the more \"Corporate\" segment of the market. A huge challenge is obviously how to market the product, but customer support for developers is tough as well -- you have to be developers to provide support for other developers, and sometimes it feels like you're troubleshooting for another dev team. For example, one time we had a client email us saying they were getting incorrect results from our API suddenly, after many back-and-forth emails, we finally asked if we could do troubleshooting with a video call and share screen -- turns out they were interestingly calling our API via a proxy with cache enabled.

Anyway, this guy was the go to guy for gas customers, and knew the database inside and out. So he created his own company, resigned as a full time employee, waited until the panic had set in properly. Then he offered consulting services back to the energy company saying he'd take care of any database processing costs, or cloud migration costs or whatever, and moved the customer data for gas customers to his own system. Then he created an API, waited a while more and said he was going away again.... Or he could stay supporting this setup if the energy company agreed to a monthly fee and API usage. Then, as far as I know, he sat back and just watched the money roll in while he automated everything else about the job. reply",

Those succeeding don't have much to gain from sharing details here. Worst case: it could invite competitors into their space. Communities that thrive on growth (e.g., open-source) tend to share freely, but API businesses, especially ones which are easy to execute, often guard their edge. A recent finding I had, while not necessarily an API: services which help you 24/7 stream a lenghty video file. YouTube live streams seem to work well for those lofi-types of channels, and there are services which are built to enable autopilot live streams. reply",

At the end of the day, it is about what the customer is willing to pay for. Back when The Pirate Bay was huge, music was essentially free. But Spotify came along and proved people are ready to pay for something better. ImageMagick is an open source tool for resizing images etc. But some people successfully build API services or SaaS-services on top of it. It works because people AND businesses pay for convenience. What space do you have knowledge of? What pains do people have in that domain that can be solved with tech? Always start with the problem. And start with an industry you know by heart or customer profile you truly care for. For me that was software developers. I was that customer myself. I programmed a certain kind of solutions, realized there should be an API for this and built that API. reply",

I'm surprised all my clients haven't switched to LLMs, but maybe I still outdo LLMs on price/accuracy since it's so niche. I'd like to sell it to someone who wants to do something with it, but it would probably take me 30-40 hours to package everything up to hand off to someone, so I consider just the opportunity cost there to be around $5-10k, and I don't think anyone wants to pay $10k for an API that makes $200/mo.

These days the operators are a bit more aware of the value of A2P (application-to-person) versus P2P which was/is very much on the decline. That also means the operators have capacity built of ready to be used without new investments. As for our own software, we are mostly a Python based shop. And we use tons of open source.

It’s making ~5k/month these days, not bad as we’re no longer actively working on it, but a fraction of what we were doing a year ago. The main challenge for us was the non-technical part. We built an API-first product because we love the tech and felt it’d allow us to focus on that part. But we still had to do marketing, sales support etc which we didn’t enjoy or excel at. Now we’re both back in larger companies where we can focus on doing ML. It was satisfying to build a working business from scratch, no regrets, but I’m definitely happier now. reply",

I wouldn't count Qwen as that much of a conversationalist though. Mistral Nemo and Small are pretty decent. All of Llama 3.X are still very good models even by today's standards.

One way to gauge this property of a community is whether people who are known experts in a respective field participate in it, and unfortunately there are very few of them on HackerNews (this was not always the case). I've had some opportunities to meet with people who are experts, usually at conferences/industry events, and while many of them tend to be active on Twitter... they all say the same things about this site, namely that it's simply full of bad information and the amount of effort needed to dispel that information is significantly higher than the amount of effort needed to spread it. Next time someone posts an article about a topic you are intimately familiar with, like top 1% subject matter expert in... review the comment section for it and you'll find just heaps of misconceptions, superficial knowledge, and my favorite are the contrarians who take these very strong opinions on a subject they have some passing knowledge about but talk about their contrarian opinion with such a high degree of confidence. One issue is you may not actually be a subject matter expert on a topic that comes up a lot on HackerNews, so you won't recognize that this happens... but while people here are a lot more polite and the moderation policies do encourage good behavior... moderation policies don't do a lot to stop the spread of bad information from poorly informed people. reply",

          "text": "This is of course true is some cases and less true in others. I consider myself an expert in one tiny niche field (computer generated code), and when that field comes up (on HN and elsewhere) over the last 30 years the general mood (from people who don't do it) is that it's poor quality code. Pre-AI this was demonstrably untrue, but meh, I don't need to convince you, so I accept your point of view, and continue doing my thing. Our company revenue is important to me, not the opinion of done guy on the internet. (AI has freshened the conversation, and it is currently giving mixed results, which is to be expected since it is non-deterministic. But I've been doing deterministic generation for 35 years.) So yeah. Lots of comments from people who don't fo something, and I'm really not interested in taking the time to \"prove\" them wrong. But equally I think the general level of discussion in areas where I'm not an expert (but experienced) is high. And around a lot of topics experience can be highly different. For example companies, employees and employers come in all sorts of ways. Some folk have been burned and see (all) management through a certain light. Whereas of course, some are good, some are bad. Yes, most people still use voting as a measure of \"I agree with this\", rather than the quality of the discussion, but that's just people, and I'm not gonna die on that hill. And yeah, I'm not above joining in on a topic I don't technically use or know much about. I'll happily say that the main use for crypto (as a currency) is for illegal activity. Or that crypto in general is a ponzi scheme. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it really is the future. But for now, it walks like a duck. So I both agree, and disagree, with you. But I'm still happy to hang out here and get into (hopefully) illuminating discussions. reply",

Having a background in machine learning helps, because at least I can search for terminology that hasn't been picked up by the hype machine yet. There's some communities that are more niche; more academically focused Discords or groups where there's better discussion going on, basically. Those are intermittent enough that you can't expect ongoing general discussion and for most I'd have to go back and check if they're still worth reading past the one discussion I found useful.

I think LLMs will find their uses, it just takes time to distil what they are really useful for vs what the AI companies are generating hype for.

It's really hard to say one model is better than another in a general way, since it depends on so many things like your use case, the prompts, the settings, quantization, quantization method and so on. If you're building/trying to build stuff depending on LLMs in any capacity, the first step is coming up with your own custom benchmark/evaluation that you can run with your specific use cases being put under test.

I've seen some models be unstable at 4-bit (where they will either repeat words or start generating random words). Note that that's a skill issue of whoever quantized the model. In general quantization even as low as 3-bit can be almost loseless when you do quantization-aware finetuning[1] (and apparently you don't even need that many training tokens), but even if you don't want to do any extra training you can be smart as to which parts of the model you're quantizing and by how much to minimize the damage (e.g. in the worst case over-quantizing even a single weight can have disastrous consequences[2]) Some time ago I ran an experiment where I finetuned a small model while quantizing parts of it to 2-bits to see which parts are most sensitive (the numbers are the final loss; lower is better): 1.5275   mlp.downscale\n    1.5061   mlp.upscale\n    1.4665   mlp.gate\n    1.4531   lm_head\n    1.3998   attn.out_proj\n    1.3962   attn.v_proj\n    1.3794   attn.k_proj\n    1.3811   input_embedding\n    1.3662   attn.q_proj\n    1.3397   unquantized baseline So as you can see quantizing some parts of the model affects it more strongly. The downprojection in the MLP layers is the most sensitive part of the model (which also matches with what [2] found), so it makes sense to quantize this part of the model less and instead quantize other parts more strongly. But if you'll just do the naive \"quantize everything in 4-bit\" then sure, you might get broken models. [1] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02631 [2] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07191 reply",

That idea makes so much sense on paper, but until you start implementing it that you realized why no one does it (including Siri). \"Some tasks are complex and better suited for complex giant model, but small models are perfectly capable of running simple limited task\" makes a ton of sense, but the component best equipped at evaluating that decision is the smarter component of your system. At which point, you might as well have had it run the task. It's like assigning the intern to triage your work items. When actually implementing the application with that approach, every time you encounter an \"AI-miss\" you would (understandably) blame the small model, and eventually give up and delegate yet-another-scnario to the cloud model. Eventually you feel you're artificially handcuffing yourself compared to literally every body else trying to ship something utilizing a 1b model. You have the worst of all options, crappy model with lots of hiccups yet it's still (by far) the most resource intensive part of your application making the whole thing super heavy and you are delegating more and more to the cloud model. The local LLM scenario is going to be entirely driven by privacy concerns (around which there is no option. It's not like an E2EE LLM API could exist) or cost concerns if you believe you can run it cheaper. reply",

It’s not like it’s only ever store locally and if you lost your phone you lost your Apple Health or Kaiser Permanente data. I already mentioned privacy being the only real concern, but it won’t be really the end user privacy. At least that particular concern isn’t the ball mover people’s comments here would make you think it is. Plenty of people are storing their medical information in Google drives and Gmail attachments already. If end user privacy from “the cloud” was actually a thing, you would have seen that reflected in the market. The privacy concerns that are of importance are that of organizations. reply",

It's in many ways nicer than Codex in that 1) full access to my hardware so can start VMs, make network requests and everything else I can do, which Codex cannot and 2) it's way faster both in initial setup, working through things and creating a patch. Of course, it still isn't at the same level as Codex itself, the model Codex is using is just way better so of course it'll get better results. But Devstral (as I currently use it) is able to make smaller changes and refactors, and I think if I evolve the software a bit more, can start making larger changes too. reply",

          "text": "General local inference strengths: - Experiments with inference-level control; can't do the Outlines / Instructor stuff with most API services, can't do the advanced sampling strategies, etc. (They're catching up but they're 12 months behind what you can do locally.) - Small, fast, finetuned models; _if you know what your domain is sufficiently to train a model you can outperform everything else_. General models usually win, if only due to ease of prompt engineering, but not always. - Control over which model is being run. Some drift is inevitable as your real-world data changes, but when your model is also changing underneath you it can be harder to build something sustainable. - More control over costs; this is the classic on-prem versus cloud decision. Most cases you just want to pay for the cloud...but we're not in ZIRP anymore and having a predictable power bill can trump sudden unpredictable API bills. In general, the move to cloud services was originally a cynical OpenAI move to keep GPT-3 locked away. They've built up a bunch of reasons to prefer the in-cloud models (heavily subsidized fast inference, the biggest and most cutting edge models, etc.) so if you need the latest and greatest right now and are willing to pay, it's probably the right business move for most businesses. This is likely to change as we get models that can reasonably run on edge devices; right now it's hard to build an app or a video game that incidentally uses LLM tech because user revenue is unlikely to exceed inference costs without a lot of careful planning or a subscription. Not impossible, but definitely adds business challenges. Small models running on end-user devices opens up an entirely new level of applications in terms of cost-effectiveness. If you need the right answer, sometimes only the biggest cloud API model is acceptable. If you've got some wiggle room on accuracy and can live with sometimes getting a substandard response, then you've got a lot more options. The trick is that the things that an LLM is best at are always going to be things where less than five nines of reliability are acceptable, so even though the biggest models have more reliability, an average there are many tasks where you might be just fine with a small fast model that you have more control over. reply",

Personally I've found it's really useful that it provides the details portions of course study materials for examples slides that's directly related to the discussions so the students can check the sources veracity of the answers provided by the LLM.

          "text": "I can think of a few reasons. 1. What you said about matching the way you think and your personal style. 2. Longevity. If you use someone else’s peoject, it’s dependent on them maintaining it. Assuming you don’t want to take it over at some point, making your own thing means you know how it all works so you can fix/maintain it if needed, and build it in a way that requires as little or as much maintenance as you want. 3. Building the tools is more fun than what you will ultimately do with it. I find the idea of writing my own site building compelling. Based on how many blogs I’ve started and never wrote in regularly, I don’t actually find the act of blogging compelling. People who have something to say and want an easy way to get the message out just pick a tool and stick with it. Others like myself, will build platforms to say things, then never actually say anything. I just build blogs from scratch over and over again, because it’s an easy, but semi interesting project that can be solved in countless ways. This could be called procrastination, but I think it’s something else, as I’m not actually trying that hard to have a blog or a site with traffic that people care about and visit. It’s just for me. reply",

          "text": "People love their craft and want to really understand how a tool works. They might start with taking a tool apart, looking at how it works, putting it back together and then using it for a bit.  Then they need a similar tool for a slightly different use case, so they start making one themselves. Maybe they have more specific, detailed needs than existing tools. Maybe there is something about the tool that annoys them or they think they could make it work better. This keeps going over time. > This was the craftsman’s ‘Golden Age’ and much time and trouble was taken over the design of tools. Craftsmen were being called upon to do more skilful and exacting work and the use of tools and the interest in development had become very widespread. Above pulled from A Brief History of the Woodworking Plane [0]. A woodworking tool that has evolved over 2,000 years. Now there are electric planers, handheld electric planers and lots of heavy machinery that do the same thing in a very automated way. If a company is mass producing kitchen cabinets, they aren't hand planing edges on boards, a machine is doing all that work. I feel like with AI we are on the cusp of moving beyond a \"Golden age\" and into an \"industrial age\" for coding, where it will become more important to have code that AI understands vs. something that is carefully crafted. Simple business pressure will demand it (whether we like it or not). The difference with hand planes (and other woodworking tools/concepts) is that a lot of people can appreciate a piece of furniture and the craft that went into it by opening a drawer and seeing hand cut dovetails for example.  When it comes to digital products, none of the consumers of the product will really care about the craftsman that created a JS library that they are indirectly using on a web site that has its \"view source\" hidden with minification/obfuscation.

There is a psychological measure for this called uncertainty avoidance . As for myself I have learned to avoid certain things that only induce complexity and as result feel confident I can build almost anything in JavaScript/TypeScript. Here are my zones of avoidance. * DOM abstraction. Working with the DOM is stupid simple, so don’t use unnecessary abstractions to make it something it isn’t. Sometimes I do find the DOM is missing important features so I will extend the DOMs API with original methods, such as getNodesByType. * No OOP. I avoid classes and inheritance as entirely unnecessary. Functions and objects are all I need for architecture. * Know your platform. In the browser it’s the DOM and Web APIs. In Node it’s their direct module APIs. Get comfortable working as close to the platform as possible. It’s less to troubleshoot later. * Avoid unnecessary string parsing. This includes things like querySelectors, innerHTML, and a lot of insanity from framework template systems. This is by far one of the two biggest performance boosts. * Preference WebSockets over HTTP. This also dramatically boosts performance and significantly reduces application complexity. reply",

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

My main concern would be to overwhelm recipients if they'd ever get included in multiple people's newsletters. I've been building on the opposite end of this. It's an open-source form submissions forwarder. I built it mostly because I wanted a service thats transparent, with usage based pricing that I could use economically for my low traffick sites. Sometime this year I want to add docker-compose to make it easier to self host. Currently it's all manual. https://simplecontactform.org reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

          "text": "I've got a friend who has been at this since learning in TV repair shops in the 1950s. His emphasis is always on fast turn-around. He doesn't believe in slowly turning on things with old electrolytic capacitors, for example. I've learned quite a bit from him. I've learned not to fear B+, but to give very healthy respect to anything more than 500 volts. (Only use 1 hand, keep the other behind you, always have a safety partner, etc) I've learned to hate Silver Mica capacitors. I've learned how to track down the bad ones that cause the \"crashing\" sound in old radios. I've learned that in very old electronics, you can let smoke out, and things will still work. I've gotten good at seeing where the smoke comes from. You'll definitely need to learn to solder. I'd suggest starting with something like an Arduino starter kit to get a sense of how components actually interact. But remember, if something is dead, you can't really make it worse. (Just be careful not to make yourself worse along the way) reply",

You need access to schematics for the products and datasheets for the components.  Of course, you also need sufficient knowledge to use that information. Then there is the issue of sourcing replacement components.  If you lack any of the foregoing, then you will have to reverse-engineer the circuits and that is very difficult with multi-layer PCBs. For any product with microcontrollers, you might be able to locate JTAG connections and use that to debug some of the functionality.

          "text": "You're not wrong. But still, a lot of gadgets can be repaired with some knowledge and effort, even if you don't have a schematic. If one just knows, for example, that very many faults are power supply related, and knows that problems with capacitors and transistors are responsible for a lot of power supply problems, you can accomplish quite a bit. But yes, if you are talking about replacing BGA packaged high-end chips in very complex devices, there's a threshold were it becomes very difficult. But even then, if we watch some of what the different folks on Youtube accomplish repairing smartphones, laptops, etc., we'll see that some of these guys can achieve some pretty impressive results even without fancy labs and complete schematics, etc. Not everything is repairable of course, but I don't think pursuing this path is exactly \"tilting at windmills\" either. reply",

          "text": "What is the pragmatic approach in this mission? There are a lot of good videos on Youtube, for one. Louis Rossmann has some good stuff (especially his older stuff), Dave Jones has some good repair videos (intermingled with a LOT of other stuff, though), and there are plenty of other channels dedicated to electronics repairs. Having said that... you'll need to know at least a bit about electronics (qua electronics) before going terribly far with electronics repair . Much the same way that one could only get so far at debugging and fixing code, if one didn't know something about writing code in the first place. So... there are, again, videos on Youtube. The Vocademy channel, for one, is a great resource for general electronics theory. And books. Don't forget books. I'd suggest, depending on your existing knowledge level, find a couple of books on basic electronics, load up some of those videos, get some components and perfboard and a soldering iron and some basic test equipment (a multimeter and an oscilloscope are a good start) and start building simple circuits. And gradually expand the range of circuits you build to become more complex over time. More or less simultaneously, start watching YT videos on \"electronics repair\". The thing is, there's a difference between knowing \"the theory of electronics\" and having the debugging / troubleshooting skills, intuition, judgment, etc. to diagnose faults. The  two things are related, but are somewhat orthogonal. At some point, find used junk non-working electronics, either stuff friends/family will give you, or stuff you dig out of a dumpster, or buy at thrift shops, or buy off of Ebay listed as \"not working / for parts only\" and start trying to fix things. So basically... \"learn theory / build stuff / fix stuff\" in an iterative loop. That's about the best advice I can give. I reckon it will be valuable in the future that comes. I agree. That's one reason (not the only reason mind you, but one) that I've spent a modest amount of money over the last year or two, upgrading my electronics lab, in terms of tools, test equipment, etc. I mean, I do this stuff for a hobby, and it's been a nearly life-long thing for me anyway. But more and more recently, I find myself thinking that the ability to repair/hack/build electronic \"stuff\" will be a skill with serious value. I just wish I had more time to commit to it. reply",

          "text": "Different problems. If you look at McCarthy's first paper [1] it becomes clear (after a long while) that eval does not have to support macros. The ideas in Common Lisp on macros and evaluation (eval) are (conceptually \"far away\" from McCarthy's paper, perhaps more developed): 1. Read-time with \"#.\" and #'set-dispatch-macro-character 2. Macroexpansion-time with #'macroexpand and #'defmacro and (macrolet …)-forms and (symbol-macrolet …)-forms 3. Compile-time (optional for evaluators) with #'compile and #'define-compiler-macro 4. Load-time with (load-time-value …)-forms 5. Run-time with #'funcall and #'eval (conceptually) and #'defun and (lambda …)-forms (conceptually) The trick is that eval is called recursively and depth-first along the abstract syntax tree (AST). Function evaluation is depth-first left-to-right. Macros and special-forms are for not depth-forst and left-to-right.  Loops need to evaluate (incf i) or \"i++\" possibly more than once, exactly once, or not at all.  \"If\" only evaluates either its second or its third argument, but never both. Note, how #'set-dispatch-macro-character, #'macroexpand, #'compile,  #'load-time-value, and #'eval are all functions.  They are \"executed at (their own) run-time.\" The difference bewteen compile-time and load-time becomes obvious in parenscript.  In parenscript compile time has symbolic-expressions (s-expressions) and parenscript-forms a.k.a. \"valid parenscript in parentheses\" while load-time already has JavaScript code.  In Lisp all of this stiff just happens to be Lisp objects.  Strings at read-time (symbolic-expression), lists for macroexpansion (macros are like user-defined special forms) [macroexpansion turns them into valid common lisp a.k.a. Common Lisp forms], and internal Lisp objects like compiled functions for the compiler, \"loader\", and run-time. Note, that the issue of having two namespaces, that of values and that of functions, is a separate issue.  Here is where macros and functions look the same, because their names are at the beginning of a \"form\", e.g. (with-open-file …).  With-open-file never directly evaluates its first argument: the list of arguments for function open. A \"form\" is a list that is meant to be evaluated.  If it is valid Common Lisp code, then it is a lisp form.  If it user-defined, then it better be a function call or a macro call.  And the macro call has to translate it into either the call of a user-defined function or valid Common Lisp code. Macros define \"new syntax\" kind of like special forms deviate from function evaluation.  (if a b c) is a special form, that is a non-function-call defined by Lisp, just like Haskell leverages lazy evaluation to define \"if\" without eager function evaluation.

          "text": "They are subtly different. Macros are the only way to process s-expressions without first calling eval on them. This is necessary because without macros you could only generate and eval quoted code. Also practically it's cumbersome to work with everything being quoted when writing lisp code generators. Without macros you could implement eval still but your internal lisp implementation could only work on quoted s-expressions, there would be no way to get back to the base unquoted level of lisp code (assuming you can't use the primitive eval, since you're trying to implement lisp in lisp). Another use case is implementing a shortcutting boolean and function. You can't do the shortcutting without macros because all of the arguments get eval'd before passing to your and function. reply",

Macros Runs at compile time (or macro-expansion time). Transform Lisp code before it's evaluated. They return new code (a Lisp form) to be compiled/evaluated later. Example:\n(defmacro my-unless (condition body)\n  `(if (not ,condition) ,body)) (my-unless (= 1 2) (print \"Not equal\")) ; expands to (if (not (= 1 2)) (print ...))

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

          "text": "> For greenfield it’s amazing I'll preface this comment with: I am a recent startup owner (so only dev, which is important) and my entire codebase has been generated via Sonnet (mostly 3.7, now using 4.0). If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

All team members should follow these guidelines when creating, updating, or completing tickets. ## Ticket Organization Tickets are organized by status and area in the following structure: TICKETS/\n  COMPLETED/       - Finished tickets\n    BACKEND/       - Backend-related tickets\n    FRONTEND/      - Frontend-related tickets\n  IN_PROGRESS/     - Tickets currently being worked on\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/\n  BACKLOG/         - Tickets planned but not yet started\n    BACKEND/\n    FRONTEND/ ## Ticket Status Indicators All tickets must use consistent status indicators: -  *BACKLOG* - Planned but not yet started\n-  *IN_PROGRESS* - Currently being implemented\n-  *COMPLETED* - Implementation is finished\n-  *ABANDONED* - Work was stopped and will not continue ## Required Ticket Files Each ticket directory must contain these files: 1. *Main Ticket File* (TICKET_ .md):\n   - Problem statement and background\n   - Detailed analysis\n   - Implementation plan\n   - Acceptance criteria 2. *Implementation Plan* (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):\n   - Detailed breakdown of tasks\n   - Timeline estimates\n   - Success metrics 3. *Implementation Progress* (IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md):\n   - Status updates\n   - Issues encountered\n   - Decisions made 4. *Design Documentation* (DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md), when relevant:\n   - Architecture recommendations\n   - Code patterns and examples\n   - Error handling strategies 5. *API Documentation* (API_DOCUMENTATION.md), when applicable:\n   - Interface definitions\n   - Usage examples\n   - Configuration options ## Ticket Workflow Rules ### Creating Tickets 1. Create tickets in the appropriate BACKLOG directory\n2. Use standard templates from .templates/ticket_template.md\n3. Set status to *Status: BACKLOG* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ### Updating Tickets 1. Move tickets to the appropriate status directory when status changes\n2. Update the status indicator in the main ticket file\n3. Update the \"Last Updated\" date when making significant changes\n4. Document progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md\n5. Check off completed tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ### Completing Tickets 1. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met\n2. Move the ticket to the COMPLETED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: COMPLETED*\n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file\n5. Create a completion summary in the main ticket file ### Abandoning Tickets 1. Document reasons for abandonment\n2. Move to COMPLETED/ABANDONED directory\n3. Set status to *Status: ABANDONED* \n4. Update the TICKET_INDEX.md file ## Ticket Linking When referencing other tickets, use relative links with appropriate paths: markdown\n@TICKET_NAME Ensure all links are updated when tickets change status. ## Ticket Cleanup and Streamlining ### When to Streamline Tickets Tickets should be streamlined and cleaned up at major transition points to maintain focus on remaining work: 1. *Major Phase Transitions* - When moving between phases (e.g., from implementation to testing)\n2. *Milestone Achievements* - After completing significant portions of work (e.g., 80%+ complete)\n3. *Infrastructure Readiness* - When moving from setup/building to operational phases\n4. *Team Handoffs* - When different team members will be taking over the work ### What to Streamline *Replace Historical Implementation Details With:*\n- Brief completed tasks checklist ( high-level achievements)\n- Current status summary\n- Forward-focused remaining work *Remove or Simplify:*\n- Detailed session-by-session progress logs\n- Extensive implementation decision histories\n- Verbose research findings documentation\n- Historical status updates and coordination notes ### Why Streamline Tickets 1. *Git History Preservation* - All detailed progress, decisions, and implementation details are preserved in git commits\n2. *Clarity for Future Work* - Makes it easier to quickly understand \"what needs to be done next\"\n3. *Team Efficiency* - Anyone picking up the work can immediately see current state and next steps\n4. *Maintainability* - Shorter, focused tickets are easier to read, understand, and keep updated ### How to Streamline 1. *Archive Detailed Progress* - Historical implementation details are preserved in git history\n2. *Create Completion Summary* - Replace detailed progress with a brief \"What's Complete\" checklist\n3. *Focus on Remaining Work* - Make current and future phases the primary content\n4. *Update Status Sections* - Keep status concise and action-oriented\n5. *Preserve Essential Context* - Keep architectural decisions, constraints, and key requirements *Goal*: Transform tickets from \"implementation logs\" into \"actionable work plans\" while preserving essential context. ## Maintenance Requirements 1. Keep the TICKET_INDEX.md file up to date\n2. Update \"Last Updated\" dates when making significant changes\n3. Ensure all ticket files follow the standardized format\n4. Include links between related tickets in both directions ## Complete Documentation For detailed instructions on working with tickets, refer to: - @Ticket Workflow Guide\n- @Ticket Index\n- @Tickets README ``` reply",

The sales guy? They wouldn’t know how to be precise enough to state what they actually need. An entry level engineer would make use of the LLM to produce the website and push it to production. Hell, only engineers know that the devil is in the details. Quick example: let’s say a Contact Us page needs to be built. There are tons of details that need to be accounted for and the LLM may skip them if it is not told about them: where does the data of the form go to? A backend endpoint? What about captcha? What about analytics? What about validation of specific fields? What about the friendly URL? And disabling the button after sending to prevent duplicate requests? An LLM is very capable of implementing all of that… if only someone who knows all of that stuff tell them first. And most importantly: LLMs don’t challenge the task given. Engineers do. Many times, problems are solved without code. reply",

This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

I see no benefit in using a low-IQ autocomplete tool to automate a small part of the remaining 10% of the job, the easiest and most enjoyable part in fact. Personally I find most of coding I do is unsuitable for LLMs anyway, because I don't need them to regurgitate standard logic when libraries are available, so most of that 10% is writing business logic tailored for the program/client.

After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code. Less is more, and I appreciate programming-as-an-art rather than being a code monkey paid by the line of code I commit.

But something like o4-mini-high is a domain expert in all versions of React, Redux, RN etc. and knows every internal SDK change over the last 10 years (or goes out and reads the changelogs and code itself). Countless times I've had it port old code to new and it figures it out 100%. It formulates good modern canonical ways to solve stuff. It knows all the stupid tricks you have to do to get RN stuff run well on Android and iOS that I would never be able to keep in my head unless I work full-time on that. And it does the eye-watering boring styling code that nobody likes, you can even just upload a screenshot of another app or a sketch on paper and it will correctly output code for the style in a matter of seconds. The end result is that I can, without investing a full-time of keeping myself current, do a professional RN dual Android/iOS app development cycle because I have the general skill to understand what to ask it and how to merge its output properly. This leaves me time to do other stuff and generally be more productive. My guess is that many who gave up on the AI coding stuff tried the bad tools like the default chatgpt 4o-mini (or tried the tools available 2 years ago) and got a bad experience. There are light-years of differences between these and something like o4-mini-high. TL;DR: use the correct model for the job, and it doesn't really need to be an argument - if it makes you more productive it's a good tool, if it doesn't, nobody is forcing you to use it. But I don't think you should imply that everybody who likes these tools are stupid. reply",

For example the price of outsourcing app development is really coming down now because it's one of the areas where the AI coding tools really excel. It's a lot of boiler-plate style code, pretty canonical stuff, no rocket science and, to be frank, not really that much that has to be clever. You can give the tools a screenshot of an UI and it gladly outputs correct styling code for it in seconds. It supercharges already skilled developers. And if you needed 6 in-house app developers before, now you only need 2. It isn't an immediate effect, but it is an effect that is slowly going to run though the business. The question is, are companies going to use fewer people to do the same, or the same amount of people and just create better products? For prototyping new ideas this is also an invaluable turbocharge for startups who can't really afford to have hordes of developers trying out alternative solutions. reply",

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

It’s valuable to have it talk through something or explain why something is designed a certain way. So it’s definitely helped me grow as an engineer. But I have not come close to being 2x as productive, I don’t think my workload would be done by 2 people in the pre-LLM era. Maybe 1.25? Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords??

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often. Before quality search engines like Google, this meant I was always flipping through reference books, man pages, and worse. Then came search engines and that was a step more productive. Then came things like SO, and that was a step more productive. I find LLMs to be another step forward, but not like a quantum leap or anything. Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

          "text": "There are a lot of terms in software development that have been co-opted from other disciplines and misrepresent a lot of development work, including 'engineering' and 'architecture'. I think it's helpful to think of engineering as a _process_ instead of a role, and the reality is that a lot of development work doesn't necessarily rely on the strong engineering methodology (e.g. measurement, material properties, tolerances, modelling, etc.) that the people developing the software might imagine just based on the number of job adverts for 'engineers'. This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs. (Unless you're writing software for launching rockets, in which case the engineering _process_ porbably should be strong). reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

Yet, I’ve tried to build a game and despite it appearing to work, it eventually has gotten confused about its own codebase and I end up with a ball of spaghetti  where requirements of yesterday get lost or broken when adding functionality today. It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch. I find this easier than the Cursor roll back or being overly cautious with suggested edits. I’m just getting to this realization so tbd if it works well. FYI, I’m good at programming generally but game dev is my Achilles. We’ll see how it it goes. reply",
