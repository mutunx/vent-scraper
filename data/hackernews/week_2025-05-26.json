The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects.  The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine.  It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files.  I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "An open-source, self-hostable app for sending out newsletter to your friends and families. I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

It's an open-source form submissions forwarder. I built it mostly because I wanted a service thats transparent, with usage based pricing that I could use economically for my low traffick sites.

Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery. reply",

Most companies have nuclear engineers like me who picked up some software skills along the way, but I've found it's always a huge benefit to bring in some nuclear-interested SWEs to help get things running with best practices. Some SWEs I've hired in the past felt a little isolated, but others have engaged well with the nuclear and mechanical engineers and had a great time.

          "text": "On my free time I've been making a small \"game\" where you control a spacecraft using a 6502 computer. You can control things like thrusters, antennas and read data from star sensors, gyros, etc. using memory mapped I/O directly and you can't control anything directly. The whole thing works pretty well, it's built using Godot & a custom Rust extension with the 6502 emulator & assembler. It can even be exported to the web so you can write your code using a CodeMirror editor and send it to the game in the browser. Now, as expected, the hard part is making it fun. Just giving players an empty code editor and a manual for the sensors/actuators doesn't seem great, and there's also no goal for now. I'd like to take inspiration from Shenzhen I/O to build a sense of progression by tackling more and more difficult control challenges maybe? It also supports running multiple computers at once so I think there's some fun potential for a \"multiplayer\" mode where you try to achieve some objective (scanning X, mining Y) against other players by sending spacecrafts with your code on them and all the crafts would run on one server. Anyway I'm curious if people would be interested in such a game! reply",

          "text": "Thanks! The answer is neither; it isn't remotely imitating the Lisa's architecture, nor is it a skin over some other previously written JS code. To be clear: this is absolutely NOT a CSS skin. The only CSS involved is used for the positioning of the canvas element on the page, and for the styling of the temporary UI elements which mimic the Lisa's hardware test screen (and those that display as a fallback if JS is disabled). When the system \"boots\" all those temporary elements are replaced with a single canvas element on which the UI is displayed. I should perhaps have been less modest in my original comment in that all of the UI components are coded from scratch. This includes a hierarchical system for displaying objects on the canvas (not dissimilar to the the DOM), the windowing system, a typesetting system, multiple systems for displaying and storing image data, and much more. I've written what I hesitate to call a graphics engine, but I guess that's sort of what it is... it even supports 1-bit blending modes. This was originally going to be more along the lines of a CSS skin, but I became so deeply frustrated with visual inconsistencies across browser engines and platforms that I ultimately decided to move all the logic I could into JS. The result is what you see now. reply",

I imagine there are lots of people who have the talent and creativity to create a multiplayer game but don't have the interest or patience in learning how to code multiplayer, and so that's who this is for!

          "text": "To be honest, that's kind of why I'm here posting about it. I think https://gatew.easel.games is impressive, but I also know the engine is capable of so much more than what people have made with it so far, and I'm trying to find people who have dreams but haven't found the right tool yet so I can build that for them. The pricing model and how to run Easel sustainably is a huge question. Easel is basically a free product, which is what I want because (a) I would just like people to use it and (b) multiplayer games need lots of players. I made the upfront decision to never run ads on Easel because I want parents and schools to be happy with it being used by their teenagers, and that has greatly changed the business dynamics. I have very delicately managed the cost-efficiency of Easel only expecting about 1% of people to ever subscribe to Easel+. For this reason, I've avoided expensive features so that one dedicated server can run at least 1 million projects and handle thousands of concurrent players at a manageable cost. It's been a real slimming exercise. I know the catalogue is small, but despite that, there are some people who come back and play one game every single day on Easel. There are also people who come back and make games every day on Easel. And there are some who do both. We have people exceeding 100+ hours a month sometimes. It's these people who Easel+ is for. Easel+ is designed as a package deal with a bunch of different game-playing and game-making perks so that people can decide for themselves what parts of the package they find valuable. But I would honestly be happy to have thousands of people using it and not paying a cent. This is my life's work and I just want it to be used, even if I have to fund it all myself. reply",

          "text": "Yes, in the end I just made this decision pragmatically and it's not a grand statement about how I think programming languages should work. I felt that it would be possible to add gradual typing to Easel eventually, and so chose to prioritise other programming language features. One of the original \"agitators\" which caused me to make Easel was because I was so surprised at how popular the modding tools for my previous game were with first-time coders. The modding tools used JSON, which might sound primitive, but if you look past the JSON it was actually defining a hierarchical declarative language for defining game behaviour. I have many theories for why first-time coders could just pick it up, but one of them is I think the hierarchical shape meant everything could be written inline, without indirection or jumping around. This format allowed all these gamers to just accidentally fall into coding and it was quite impressive how far they got without any help. But those old modding tools were quite limited really, and that limited how much coding people could learn. So for years I just kept wondering what would happen if someone made that magic hierarchical declarative shape unlimited by merging it with a traditional imperative programming language. Would it allow gamers to accidentally fall into learning actual coding? It took me about 2 years to squash together these two seemingly-opposed paradigms and make the Easel programming language. Doing this required slimming down on the other language features in order to iterate quickly on this big problem, so that's how we ended up not having strong typing, amongst other things. But I don't regret what I chose to prioritise, and I hope to address this in the coming years! reply",

          "text": "LLMs give you superpowers if you work on a wide range of tasks and aren't a deep expert on all of them.  They aren't that great if you know the area you are working in inside and out and never stray from it. For example, using an LLM to help you write a Dockerfile when you write Dockerfiles once a project and don't have a dedicated expert like a Deployment Engineer in your company is fantastic. Or using an LLM to get answers faster than google for syntax errors and other minor issues is nice. Even using LLM with careful prompting to discuss architecture tradeoffs and get its analysis (but make the final decision yourself) can be helpful. Generally, you want to be very careful about how you constrain the LLM through prompts to ensure you keep it on a very narrow path so that it doesn't do something stupid (as LLMs are prone to do), you also often have to iterate because LLMs will occasionally do things like hallucinate APIs that don't actually exist.  But even with iteration it can often make you faster. reply",

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

It gets stuck in loops (removing and adding the same code/concept), it gets hung up on simple errors, etc. For greenfield it’s amazing, no doubt, but unless you are watching it very closely and approving/reviewing the code along the way it will go off the rails. At a certain point it’s easier to add the new feature or make the modification yourself. Even if the LLM could do it, it would burn tons of money and time. I expect things to get better, this will not always be the state of things, but for now “vibe coding” (specifically not reviewing/writing code yourself) is not sustainable. Most people doing it have a github profile that is a mile wide and a meter deep. LLM’s are amazing and useful, but “vibe coding” with them is not sustainable currently. reply",

Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code.

LLM doesn’t have a standardized directory structure, so you end up with different projects having different structures and file naming conventions. This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

I'm absolutely convinced that people who say LLMs are not making them more productive either don't understand how to use them correctly, or they are working on very specific niche problems/infrastructure where they aren't useful. 2x may not sound like much compared to what you read in the media, but if a few years ago you had told companies that you can provably make their engineers even 2x more productive on average you'd probably be swimming in billions of dollars now. That kind of productivity increase is absolutely huge. reply",

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often. Before quality search engines like Google, this meant I was always flipping through reference books, man pages, and worse. Then came search engines and that was a step more productive. Then came things like SO, and that was a step more productive. I find LLMs to be another step forward, but not like a quantum leap or anything. Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch.

This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs.

          "text": "I'm learning math through Math Academy, ChatGPT and YouTube (mostly 3Blue1Brown and similar channels). Without that specifc combination, it would've been hell. Now it's just nice. A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

          "text": "Is it? I didn't bother to check as it wasn't too relevant. I wasn't stuck anymore. Worst-case it's a memnonic that is untrue. Best case: it is. For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

Let's face it \"prompt engineering\" is a synonym for \"I have to waste time coming up with hacky workarounds to make this dumb LLM come up with something usable\". In the end, its always quicker and easier to do it myself.  And unless you are fresh out of school, if you've got more than 10 minutes of coding experience, you will always do a better job than the LLM. Every time a new LLM model comes out, I fall into the same old trap \"oh well, this one must be better, surely\" I say to myself. And yet its always the same \"you can't polish a turd but you can roll it in glitter\" experience. I'm sick and tired of LLMs hallucinating shit. I'm sick and tired of LLMs inventing functions that have been available in stdlib for years. I'm sick and tired of LLMs generating useless code with boilerplate subfunctions that just contain a single commented \"implement it yourself\" line. On top of that LLMs are simply terrible for the environment, guzzling up all that electricity, producing nothing but hot air and bullshit results in return.

And then there’s the middle group, people quietly getting real, uneven, but worthwhile value. You’d be surprised. The vast majority of engineering isn’t that unique. Usefulness often depends on the age of the codebase and the dynamics of the team. I’m firmly in the middle camp: far from perfect, but I get real value from these tools as they stand today.

I use a wide variety of tools. For more private or personal tasks, I mostly rely on Claude and OpenAI; sometimes I also use Google or Perplexity—whichever gives the best results. For business purposes, I either use Copilot within VSCode or, via an internal corporate platform, Claude, OpenAI, and Google. I’ve also experimented a bit with Copilot Studio. I’ve been working like this for about a year and a half now, though I haven’t had access to every tool the entire time. So far, I can say this: Yes, LLMs have increased my productivity. I’m experimenting with different programming languages, which is quite fun. I’m gaining a better understanding of various topics, and that definitely makes some things easier. But—regardless of the model or its version—I also find myself getting really, really frustrated. The more complex the task, the more I step outside of well-trodden paths, and the more it's not just about piecing together simple components… the more they all tend to fail. And if that’s not enough: in some cases, I’d even say it takes more time to fix the mess an LLM makes than it ever saved me in the first place. Right now, my honest conclusion is this:\nLLMs are useful for small code completion tasks, troubleshooting and explaining —but that’s about it. They’re not taking our jobs anytime soon. reply",

In my experience, LLMs are way more useful for coding and less problem-prone when you use them without exaggerated expectations and understand that it was trained on buggy code, and that of course it is going to generate buggy code. Because almost all code is buggy. Don't delegate design for it, use functional decomposition, do your homework and then use LLMs to eliminate toil, to deal with the boring stuff, to guide you on unfamiliar territory. But LLMs don't eliminate the need for you to understand the code that goes with your name. And usually, if you think a piece of LLM generated code is perfect, remember that maybe the defects are there, but you need to improve your own knowledge and skills to find it.

          "text": "Basically yes, once the \"problem\" gets too big, the LLM stops being useful. As you say, it's great for automating away boring things; as a more complicated search & replace, for instance.  Or, \"Implement methods so that it satisfies this interface\", where the methods are pretty obvious.  Or even \"Fill out stub CRUD operations for this set of resources in the API\". I've recently started asking Claude Opus 4 to review my patches when I'm done, and it's occasionally caught errors, and sometimes has been good at prompting me to do something I know I really should be doing. But once you get past a certain complexity level -- which isn't really that far - it just stops being useful. For one thing, the changes which need to be made often span multiple files, each of which is fairly large; so I try to think carefully about which files would need to be touched to make a change; after which point I find I have an idea what needs to be changed anyway. That said, using the AI like a \"rubber duck\" programmer isn't necessarily bad.  Basically, I ask it to make a change; if it makes it and it's good, great!  If it's a bit random, I just take over and do it myself.  I've only wasted the time of reviewing the LLM's very first change, as nearly everything else I'd've had to do if I wrote the patch myself from scratch anyway. Furthermore, I often find it much easier to take a framework that's mostly in the right direction and modify it the way that I want, than to code up everything from scratch.  So if I say, \"Implement this\", and then end up modifying nearly everything, it still seems like less effort than starting from scratch myself. The key thing is that I don't work hard at trying to make the LLM do something it's clearly having trouble with.  Sometimes the specification was unclear and it made a reasonable assumption; but if I tell it to do something and it's still having trouble, I just finish the task myself. reply",

It can then give me approximate code that I will probably need to modify a fair bit, but that I can use as the basis for my work. Having an LLM code a preliminary solution is often more efficient than jumping to reading the docs immediately. I do usually need to read the docs, but by the time I look at them, I already know what I need to look up and have a feasible approach in my head. If I know exactly how I would build something, an LLM isn't as useful, although I will admit that sometimes an LLM will come up with a clever algorithm that I wouldn't have thought up on my own. I think that, for everyone who has been an engineer for some time, we already have a way that we write code, and LLMs are a departure.

The actual writing of the code is never the hard part or time-consuming part for me - it's figuring out the right architecture, figuring out how to properly refactor someone else's hairball, finding performance issues, debugging rare bugs, etc. Yes, LLMs accelerate the process of writing the boilerplate, but unless you're building brand new products from scratch every 2nd week, how much boilerplate are you really writing?

I find it completely falls over on a complete feature. I tried using aider and people seem to love it but it was just a disaster for me. I wanted to implement a fairly simple templated email feature in a Next.js app. The kind of thing that would take me about a day. This is one of the most typical development scenarios I can imagine. I described the feature in it's entirety and aider completely failed, not even close. So I started describing sub-features one by one and it seemed to work better. But as I added more and more, existing parts began to break, I explained the issues to aider and it just got worse and worse with every prompt.

I just need something that works, but I can still ask for code that can be maintained and expanded if needed. It finally clicked for me when I tried Gemini and ChatGPT side by side. I found that my style of working is more iterative than starting with a fully formed plan. Gemini did well on oneshots, but my lack of experience made the output messy. This made it clear to me that the more chatty ChatGPT was working for me since it seems to incorporate new stuff better. Great for those \"Oh, crap I didn't think of that\" moments that come up for inexperienced devs like me. With ChatGPT I use a modular approach. I first plan a high level concept with 03, then we consider best practices for each. After that I get best results with 4o and Canvas since that model doesn't seem to overthink and change direction as much. Granted, my creations are not pushing up against the limits of human knowledge, but I consistently get clean maintainable results this way. Recently I made a browser extension to show me local times when I hover over text on a website that shows an international time. It uses regex to find the text, and I would never have been able to crank this out myself without spending considerable time learning it. This weekend I made a Linux app to help rice a spare monitor so it shows scrolling cheat sheets to help me memorize stuff. This turned out so well, that I might put it up on GitHub.

Thus, my recommendation would be - try non-agentic tools. My primary workflow is something that works with the Zed editor, and which I later ported as a custom plugin to Goland. Basically, you first chat with the AI in a sidebar possibly embedding a couple of files in the discussion (so far nothing new), and then (this is the new part) you use contextual inline edits to rewrite code \"surgically\". Importantly, the inline edits have to be contextual, they need to know both  the content of the edited file, and of the conversation so far, so they will usually just have a prompt like \"implement what we discussed\". From all I know, only Zed's AI assistant supports this. With this I've had a lot of success. I still effectively make all architectural decisions, it just handles the nitty-gritty details, and with enough context in the chat from the current codebase (in my case usually tens of thousands of tokens worth of embedded files) it will also adhere very well to your code-style. reply",

I was still learning Java at uni (while being a Python/Lisp fanboy) when I realised this: - Complex and wordy languages need tooling (like autocomplete, autoformatting) to handle the tedious parts. - Simple and expressive languages can get away with coding in notepad.exe. - Lisp, as simple and powerful as it is, needs brace highlighting. You. Simply. Just. Can't. Now 10, 20 years later you can look back at the evolution of many of these languages; some trends I've observed: - Java, C#, C++, have all borrowed a lot from functional languages. - JVM has Clojure. - Go stubbornly insists on \"if err != nil\" - which isn't even the worst part; the following fmt.Errorf is. - Rust (post-1.0) cautiously moved towards \"?\"; Zig (still pre-1.0) also has specific syntax for errors. - Python is slowly getting more verbose, mostly because of type annotations. - Autoformatters are actually great, you don't even have to care about indenting code as you spit it out, but... Python, being whitespace-sensitive, makes them a bit less useful. Good tooling helps you with wordy languages. Expressive languages help you write concise code. Code is read much more often than it's written. Deterministic tooling can work with the structure of the code, but LMs (being probabilistic) can help you work with its intent . Language models are an evolution of automated tooling - they will get better, just like autocomplete got better; but they will never \"solve\" coding.

          "text": "Nope, at least Claude code is very useful IME. Great for annoying ad-hoc programming where the objective is clear but I lack the time or motivation to do it. Example: After benchmarking an application on various combinations of OS/arch platforms, I wanted to turn the barely structured notes into nice graphs. Claude Code easily generated Python code that used a cursed regex parser to extract the raw data and turned it into a bunch of grouped bar charts via matplotlib. Took just a couple minutes and it didn't make a single mistake. Fantastic time saver! This is just an ad-hoc script. No need to extend or maintain it for eternity. It has served its purpose and if the input data will change, I can just throw it away and generate a new script. But if Claude hadn't done it, the graphs simply wouldn't exist. Update: Sorry, missed \"writing self-contained throwaway pieces of code\"... well for core development I too haven't really used it. reply",

Particularly, with data structures it is garbage: it nevers understands the constrains that justify writing a new one instead of relying on the ones from the standard library. And finally, it is incapable of understanding changes of mind. It will go back to stufd already discarted or replaced. The worst part of all is that it insists in introducing its own \"contributions\". For example, recently I have been doing some work on ML and I wanted to see the effect of some ablations. It destroyed my code to add again all the stuff I had removed on purpose. Overall, it provides small typing/search savings, but it cannot be trusted at all yet. reply",

A muddied or insufficient context can sometimes degrade performance by a whole model generation, ime. What works for me is collecting it manually and going one implementation chunk at a time. If it fails, I either do it myself or break it down into smaller chunks. As models got better these chunks got larger and larger. Collecting context manually forces me to really consider what information is necessary to solve the problem, and it's much easier to then jump in to fix issues or break it down compared to sending it off blind. It also makes it a lot faster, since I shortcircuit the context collection step and it's easier to course-correct it. Collecting manually is about 10 seconds of work as I have an extension that copies all files I have opened to the clipboard. reply",

The podcast is a short-format that explains the problem, the tool as a solution and some side notes. Example: \"File renaming is annoying and complicated. Then I found the `renameutils` package and from that i use qmv. It opens your favourite editor with the names of all files you want to rename. Once you are done with the modifications, you close the editor and the files are renamed. That's it! Enjoy!\" I actually started it as I just LOVE cli tools and want to spread some love for them. Also I love telling people about them and so many people were thankful for the hints and later-on told me \"oh that tool saved me so much time! i love it.\" And the podcast is just the idea to spread the knowledge of those tools reply",

          "text": "Since you already work as an automation engineer, it might be a bit harder since programming is probably part of your job, but this is what I did at a previous company:\nI wrote up a contract basically saying that since programming large programs was outside the scope of my normal work, any such programs I wrote would not be considered \"works for hire\" (a legal term in the US) and not property of the company, but instead my own property that I could sell elsewhere if I wanted.  I was specifically allowed to use company resources to develop the software (including reasonable time my manager signed off on) and in return the company would get a non-exclusive perpetual right to use and modify the software as they saw fit. This contract was a win-win.  My company got the features they wanted as part of my normal employment, but I also got to keep the idea and monetize it outside the company if I wanted to.  The company didn't need to worry about licensing if I left since I granted a perpetual right to use/modify. Unfortunately for various reasons the project never got completed and I never monotized it, so I can't tell you the real-world outcome, but I do know we were all happy with the terms going into it. reply",

          "text": "Mentioning that you negotiated to keep your code from falling under \"works for hire\" does a lot of heavy lifting in this (very well packed) example. I recommend that the OP dig into what \"works for hire\" means in the US to get a sense of what they should negotiate [to avoid]. It can definitely be a win/win for the company as well as for an enterprising engineer. The general idea is simply to go outside the scope of your contract and do something the company didn't ask for, in exchange for a bit of money and the right to reuse whatever code you developed for them. Avoiding works for hire contracts is how I built a 25 year war chest of reusable components and frameworks, each piece commissioned to an individual task but each used and modified in my next jobs for my next clients, until many versions later I would update my original clients with them. My advice to OP is to always present your ideas to owners or managers with open ears, and explain how it will help the company. Secondly, never do the work for free. Thirdly, always retain your rights to your ideas and your code when you're working on something creative. If they have a problem with that you can also explain that it's unlikely anyone else will either fill this niche to save them money or that any competitor will ever actually know about or use what you will build for them, but that having it at your disposal is a way for you to continue increasing their efficiency (which is true). It's also a way to make them beholden to you at very little initial cost. reply",

Formalizing the idea while employed and then taking it outside could be trouble.  Probably worth discussing details with a lawyer before attempting.

          "text": "Quick suggestion: maybe contact the vendor company and offer to create a frontend for them instead as a contract thing? --- I've gone through the exact scenarion in your question though, this is roughly the path I took (Estonia & EU, YMMV in other jurisdictions): - start by going over your contract - is this overall even allowed? Some companies capture all IP you create 24/7, in this case you'll need to get the contract changed or get an exception - even if your contract allows doing other work (creating separate IP) outside of company time, still ask for written permission from your manager and possibly a skip level or two. I got a written email from my VP of eng and CTO before proceeding. - you will probably need to _completely_ separate your own work from the company work. This means using your personal laptop, never working on this during work hours, etc. Separating this sometimes can be hard, especially if you get something like a bug report from your employer - you can't work with it until you're off the clock. - I also completely cut myself off from the purchasing decision - I let them know I was working on a project, gave them a landing page and let the purchasing team do a decision completely on their own - if you hope to build a business out of this it's best to be upfront about it, e.g. by telling your manager that you might leave to focus on the business full-time if it takes off All of this assumes you're on good terms with your employer overall. reply",

For example, instead of buying your product the execs could fire you and hire someone else to do this internally. I see only three ways you might wing it: 1. Talk to your execs (ideally, the CEO) directly and sell this. On failure, be prepared to work on this internally. If so, ask for more money/promotion, which may not work but will not hurt either. 2. Call the other company and offer to improve their product for more money/promotion. 3. Get a techie friend to front for you: he approaches your company, you do the work, he shares the money. That's really grey area (being charitable). My 2c. reply",

Because the corporate answer is: \"Seeing and working on improving your organization is already part of your job. Talk to management and get a project rolling.\" Do it well, get promotions and raises. And then the entrepreneurial answer is to skip all that, go build it yourself, then sell it to many organizations. But you probably cannot do that as an employee, depending on your employment contract. So sure, the surface levels answers are to talk to a lawyer, your manager, etc. But the deeper answer is to decide on and commit to a direction - are you happy being an employee, or do you need to walk out and start your own thing? (And as a side note, don't build a startup that is a front-end to someone else's product. It may fill a need, but you are going to be spending all your hours keeping up with their changes, and ultimately your success is tied to their decisions and they could wipe you out just by spending a month improving their UX.) reply",

If it's something that's specific to your company and there is no market outside it, you have one customer that at the same time has strong leverage over you due to your current employment. If it's something that could be generally useful, you likely still don't have a market: if your product ever became popular, the big-name company selling the original software could add it as a feature or paid extension and would have a huge marketing advantage over you. The company you currently work for will likely not be willing to pay much for your work, and might take offense and fire you if you try to negotiate too hard. They could also decide that your new job is writing this thing... You could try to leverage it for a bonus or promotion or something like that. That's unlikely to capture a significant amount of the value you provide, but so are the other options. If you think the idea in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44080196 will fly, you could try that. I think it's unlikely to fly but it's the option that likely pays out best if it does fly, and if you approach it carefully (\"this is outside the scope of my role and my department, but I could do it in my free time\"), you might be able to pull it off with limited risk. You also need to understand how decision processes work at your company and optimize your proposal for it. If it's more work to get legal to approve the contract with you than to get approval to pay 10x as much to the original vendor to add something half as good as a feature, the vendor gets the job. reply",

          "text": "All decisions/actions have a “ceiling” and a “floor”, the best possible outcome and the worst. Let’s consider them for this situation. Ceiling - Company buys your software - You sell it to other companies - This becomes your full time job Floor - Fired - Trust lost, future advancement blocked (not saying it’s right, just that it could happen) Also important are how likely the outcomes are. Looking at the above and my own experience working at companies, having side projects, and selling them, I think you are much closer to the floor than the ceiling (in probability). Here are some hard truths: - Even if something is a win-win, many companies will not see it that way. They often react negatively to things they don’t understand or are uncommon. - Depending on where you work it might be impossible to develop a side project without the company owning the IP (sometimes you can get a special waiver but not if it has overlap with what your company does) - How capable are you of writing this software and are you really sure you have the problem/solution well understood? I don’t want to be rude but it sounds like you saw one presentation and think you can build and sell a solution that’s not spec’d out. I’m also not sure if your skill set, have you created software like this on your own before? - Just because people are enthusiastic about the prospect of this tool doesn’t mean they are willing to pay for it (or will even still be interested 1 day, 1 week, 1 month from now) - Developing software for a company (as an employee) and developing on your own are 2 different sets of skills. There is overlap, but it’s not the same - Sales/Marketing and running a business are a completely different set of skills. It’s rare to have a developer who can also do this well. Not impossible, just rare. - If you aren’t passionate about this then even if you are successful, you will not be happy. Employee? Work on whatever, no problem. Contractor? Work on whatever. Sole proprietor? Make sure it’s something you enjoy/care about. Maybe you do care about YAML file GUIs. At a minimum I would wait 2-4 weeks and gauge interest in the tool again. See if people are still super interested or if it’s “Huh? Oh yeah, ehh, it was just something that would be cool but we wouldn’t pay for it”. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, think everyone is as excited as you, then find out later they don’t care. Also use this time to see if the project still interests YOU. If, after all of this, you still want to pursue this then make sure to check your employment contract and even if there is nothing about side-projects/IP get _written_ approval from your manager. Lastly, ignore the people here suggesting you do anything “sneaky”, like the “I have a friend who is developing software that does this”. This is no way to live and those chickens will come home to roost. Either the company will catch you and/or you will be committing some kind of crime if you do obscure it. In all honesty there is a _very_ low chance that this is worth pursuing. I know personally how easy it can be to get caught up in an idea like this but the chances of it working out are low. Maybe in a better world they would be higher but I’ve seen enough to assume that the company will respond _poorly_ even to a well reasoned and mutually advantageous offer. It sucks, but that’s just the reality of most places. Even if your company is not like this, it still might be better for you to just pitch working on it internally and leverage a bonus/raise/title. reply",

          "text": "Depends on what you want to do. But my 2 cents are that like all new technology, LLMs will become a commodity. Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

          "text": "LLMs already are a commodity. Google has already kicked off the competitive price wars.  Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

It's actually pretty helpful for a SWE to understand them reasonably deeply, especially when they're so leaky as an abstraction (arguably, even the more nuanced characteristics of your database of choice will influence the design of your whole application).

We save a lot of manual time where we used to have to resolve unknown documents. The LLM can help fill out missing data, too. It's all stored as annotations so it's clear who/what edited the data. Granted this is a pretty simple task and a low stakes scenario, but I don't think we should limit ourselves to assuming AI will always only be dev tooling. reply",

Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy.

The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking.

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

There may also be some white collar jobs that will be safe longer due to regulatory reasons or whatever. Maybe get your physician's assistant license or something?

Currently people would tend to involve data scientists into this job, but data scientists are often less versed into the software engineering aspect, eg when they work more on notebooks than web apps.\nThe job is akin to being a web developer, so a \"normal\" developer but specialized in a certain field. Knowing the internals of LLMs is a big bonus, but you can start your journey with treating them as black box tools and still craft relevant solutions. You'll need to learn about running systems with databases (vector, graph, relational and nosql are all useful) and plugging multiple services together (docker, kubernetes, cloud hosting). reply",

          "text": "Maybe I'm too late to the party, but here are my 2 cents. AI/LLMs for web dev is like StackOverflow on steroids. Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

          "text": "> What kind of tasks you give Codex? Currently in the stage of evaluating Codex (mostly comparing it to Aider and my own homegrown LLM setup). I'm able to get changes out of it, that mostly make sense, but you really need to take whatever personal guidelines you have for coding and \"encode\" them into the AGENTS.md, and really focus on asking the right question/request changes in the right way. Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

The nature of day jobs is that even when your day job is doing something you love, you still resent it to some degree because it is a day job...the touring musician still has to ride in rented vans and stay in cheap hotels. Which is to say that all a day job needs to do is pay for rent and ramen and a good day job allows you to do the things that feed your soul in your time away from it. That's it. Good luck. reply",

The commit message ought to mention tradeoffs or alternative attempts. It may never happen, but post-mortem folks will want to have the assurance of thoughtfulness. That's true even if it's your own invention. You would want to note prior work. (If there aren't any or none was searched, you wouldn't have to cite anyway.) Likely though, implementors and adopters are interested in the design and references. The prompt doesn't necessarily need to be committed to source control, but it does bring up a question: if the prompt can reproduce the (company-owned) code diff, doesn't it need to be independently auditable as well? Same with local scripts. It's on the company machine, but it's not really as inspectable as on a remote branch. Does one default-share those? Some are truly experimental. That would depend on policy. (A major outage can influence policy.) It's easier if the prompt is on a company account; then only the link needs to be included, instead of a massive text file. reply",

          "text": "I think this type of question is, roughly, backwards. If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

          "text": "I've always been under the impression that if you make something truly useful or interesting, it will spread through word of mouth naturally and quickly. This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "This [0] comment and discussion under it about how non technical businesses are very rarely run by technical people, and how if you apply your technical skills to such a business it can be a force multiplier. Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

From being a place to debate/discuss technology and technology-related concepts to a source of news that has given me a edge (IMHO). Even at work I feel starved for that (not enough time and/or people interested in it) but here you can always find a topic to talk about and geek-out on.

If I'm really devoted to feeding the hungry, for instance, I should always remember the proper goal is to end hunger (outright). Even if that goal is unattainable. Maybe because that goal is unattainable.

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",

If they could do it, developers wouldn't have a problem. One must resist the temptation to help and should only observe how the users \"misuse\" the code. When they make a mistake, it's usually a good indicator of bad design, which is promptly corrected.

I've been a product management lead for 2 commercial open-core companies and people drastically overestimate: - How much code the community contributes (in both cases, >95% of all code was written by employees hired by the commercial company)\n- How few commercial resources are needed to support the community (running forums, answering GitHub tickets, etc)\n- How much financial support is actually forthcoming when there's not some \"locked commercial features\" As the paper points out, many of these widely used commercial projects receive a few hundred thousand dollars at most in donations (often much less) but need to employ more developers than that financing can support to maintain a baseline capability to address basic bug fixes (including security fixes) once they become \"popular enough\" to be known by the masses. reply",

It's one of the few open source projects (besides Blender and GIMP) that is used directly by non-technical end-users and that has managed to surpass its commercial brethren , both in features and popularity. This is partly due to its extreme, almost Emacs-like hackability and a vibrant plugin ecosystem, which provides everything from better speech synthesizers to accessibility enhancements for other apps. It has been created by two guys in Australia, mostly in response to the outrageous prices of commercial screen readers (~$1500 for noncommercial use). The situation has gotten better since then, Windows now comes with Narrator, which is... usable, but NVDA is still the top contender for most (non-enterprise) use cases.

Most of us live a busy life, and it's usually hard to stop for a moment and think of the many things around us that make living better, even if it's a tiny open source project that solves a little, almost unknown, problem, run by some random guy in Hungary or Minnesota or Sicily. I'd bet that a fair number of us on HN have some form of disposable assets / money, and that a small donation will not ruin our lives. Some of us might have an even larger capacity to donate. It's nice when we find the time to appreciate something, and decide to support it at least with our money, if not with a bit of our time and effort. Side note: I am worried about robots, and am actively looking for a project that could make robot OS or components or the AI/brain that drives them, more human and less harmful.

Recently someone posted K-scale labs [4] as robot OS, but imo looks more like a well-funded SV startup that will go full OpenAI and close everything off as soon they hit R&D traction.

Their current legal situation didn't just happen to them: they made an intentional choice to do something which ~everyone who knew anything about law warned them would be catastrophic and are now facing the catastrophe that they were warned about. They acted like a small activist group with nothing to lose rather than the essential piece of infrastructure that they have become. I appreciate that the Internet Archive only exists because it took legal risks back in the day and those risks paid off. But from a strategic perspective you really have to stop being an activist organization once you've won enough ground that being ground to a pulp by the establishment would be a catastrophic loss for humanity. At that point it's time to let the little guys with nothing to lose take the mantle and just focus on preserving the ground that you've won. reply",

At their current level of importance, they need to be progressives, not revolutionaries. They essentially took up arms against the industry using covid as an excuse. Well, I personally despise the IP industry and think that it needs radical reform, if not complete destruction, we have to live to fight another day as well. Unless they really thought covid was truly going to kill us all and wipe us all off the planet, it was a short-sighted move on their part. Now that's sad, I hope they learned their lesson, and I think we should all step up to help defend them. Aside from donations, I think people should be making a large amount of noise at their elected representatives to start reforming the ridiculous IP framework in the United States. The whole point of copyright and other protections was to ensure that there was some incentive to people to produce content and be able to monetize it. I think it's ludicrous to suggest that you need such an utterly long period with a shark full of teeth to go after people in order to incentivize the producing of content. reply",

You can offer your time, coding skills, feedback, design expertise, or simply help by spreading the word. In a world overflowing with information, visibility is a valuable form of support. Choosing to boycott what doesn't align with your values is often underappreciated but can be very impactful. Personally, I prefer to reshare and promote the projects I believe in.

At the risk of being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion: but if circumventing ads is your goal, then just get Youtube Premium in instead of paying for piracy. Because contrary to popular belief, the majority of that subscription fee is actually distributed amongst the content creators that you watch. And for the majority of genres this pays the creator more than regular ad-revenue. I don't buy merchandise because I don't like waste, so apart from direct donations (PayPal/Patreon), Youtube Premium is my preferred way of contributing my favorite content creators.

This was considerably more money than I could afford to contribute personally. And across more projects. When doing this it is important to communicate clearly if these are one-off contributions or if the projects can expect an annual contribution.  Sadly, I didn't trust the bean counters at my employer, so I made it clear that \"these are one off contributions - do not plan for future contributions from XYZ Corp\".  Still we managed to contribute for a handful of years. (They stopped contributing after I left the company.  Actually, the entire division, bean counters and all, was scrapped.

If your --about has it, cool if your --version has it cool, or in your Help->About menu option, cool.

I'm mostly making it for myself because I want to share what I've been up to and family photos, without uploading it to Facebook or whatnot. At the moment, the flow goes like this: 1. During the week, write posts for things that have happened. 2. Posts can be assigned to groups. (family, friends etc). 3. At the end of the week (or month), the app automatically creates a newsletter for each group by pulling posts assigned to each group. Add some final touches yourself and send it off! 4. Every newsletter will come with a link to download all images. I'm trying to design it to be as old people friendly as possible which meant making the experience as simple as it can get. This made me settle on email newsletters. Emails are ubiquitous, have been around and will be around for a while. It's easy to sign up and things are just pushed to you instead of having to go to another app. Another thing I want is multilingual support as my family is Korean my in-laws are not. I'm hoping to get an MVP working this week and get some testing done with my own parents and in-laws. reply",

          "text": "SMR is now a very general term, ranging a few megawatts to 450. We also have the term 'microreactors' now which are like 0.1-10 MWe or so. We have built dozens of microreactors and small reactors in these ranges in the past. Invariably, they were all too expensive to keep operating. Major microreactor examples include PM-3A, which powered McMurdo station in antarctica for some years, SM-1A in Alaska, PM-2A in Greenland, PM-1 in Wyoming, truck-mounted ML-1 in Idaho, the ill-fated SL-1 microreactor in Idaho, the prototype SM-1 in DC, and the MH-1A floating power barge in Panama. The smaller power reactors like the Peach Bottom HTGR ran fine, but were still too small to compete with their GW-scale neighbors. They all shut down. Larger advanced reactors like Ft. St. Vrain shut down due to operations and maintenance challenges. Nuclear history is littered with failed advanced reactor projects. This doesn't mean they can't be done well, but it does mean that it's not easy. The guys out there right now hyping up that they're going to change the world but who have never handled radiation are in for a big reckoning. I hope they succeed, but they probably will not. I do think small reactors are a good way to re-establish technical know-how. If you can make a few fringe small reactors and sell them in remote areas, then that's a great way to re-bootstrap people who do know how to build and run new types of reactors. For commodity power, e.g. powering data centers, this will help people be able to build larger more economical reactors. Powering datacenters with microreactors is very likely an impossibly expensive proposition due to inherently poor chain reaction neutronics. Too many neutrons leak out. reply",

          "text": "There's a ton of money pouring into nuclear power right now, both fusion and fission. There are dozens of small VC-funded startups now in addition to the more \"traditional\" billionaire-funded nuclear startups. Each of them need SWEs to help with automating the physics/design simulations, document creation/management, plant design configuration/change management, QA compliance, construction management, experiment IT (instruments, controls, data collection, data reduction). Most companies have nuclear engineers like me who picked up some software skills along the way, but I've found it's always a huge benefit to bring in some nuclear-interested SWEs to help get things running with best practices. Some SWEs I've hired in the past felt a little isolated, but others have engaged well with the nuclear and mechanical engineers and had a great time. Be prepared for some weird fights with nuclear IT teams who are extra afraid of criminal penalties associated with export control laws. reply",

It's a good-enough boiling water reactor that Hitachi was able to construct with record-breaking speed. The IAEA is the best place to start.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects.  The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine.  It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files.  I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "https://easel.games A game engine that lets you code multiplayer games without coding the multiplayer! My idea was to put multiplayer into the fabric of the programming language itself. This allows the engine to automatically turn your game into a multiplayer game, without you needing to learn anything about networking or synchronization. I imagine there are lots of people who have the talent and creativity to create a multiplayer game but don't have the interest or patience in learning how to code multiplayer, and so that's who this is for! I've been working on this for 3 years and there were lots of tricky parts rolling back and deterministically executing a whole programming language, but it's working now! My next phase is to increase the breadth of features so better games can be made with it! reply",

          "text": "To be honest, that's kind of why I'm here posting about it. I think https://gatew.easel.games is impressive, but I also know the engine is capable of so much more than what people have made with it so far, and I'm trying to find people who have dreams but haven't found the right tool yet so I can build that for them. The pricing model and how to run Easel sustainably is a huge question. Easel is basically a free product, which is what I want because (a) I would just like people to use it and (b) multiplayer games need lots of players. I made the upfront decision to never run ads on Easel because I want parents and schools to be happy with it being used by their teenagers, and that has greatly changed the business dynamics. I have very delicately managed the cost-efficiency of Easel only expecting about 1% of people to ever subscribe to Easel+. For this reason, I've avoided expensive features so that one dedicated server can run at least 1 million projects and handle thousands of concurrent players at a manageable cost. It's been a real slimming exercise. I know the catalogue is small, but despite that, there are some people who come back and play one game every single day on Easel. There are also people who come back and make games every day on Easel. And there are some who do both. We have people exceeding 100+ hours a month sometimes. It's these people who Easel+ is for. Easel+ is designed as a package deal with a bunch of different game-playing and game-making perks so that people can decide for themselves what parts of the package they find valuable. But I would honestly be happy to have thousands of people using it and not paying a cent. This is my life's work and I just want it to be used, even if I have to fund it all myself. reply",

          "text": "Yes, in the end I just made this decision pragmatically and it's not a grand statement about how I think programming languages should work. I felt that it would be possible to add gradual typing to Easel eventually, and so chose to prioritise other programming language features. One of the original \"agitators\" which caused me to make Easel was because I was so surprised at how popular the modding tools for my previous game were with first-time coders. The modding tools used JSON, which might sound primitive, but if you look past the JSON it was actually defining a hierarchical declarative language for defining game behaviour. I have many theories for why first-time coders could just pick it up, but one of them is I think the hierarchical shape meant everything could be written inline, without indirection or jumping around. This format allowed all these gamers to just accidentally fall into coding and it was quite impressive how far they got without any help. But those old modding tools were quite limited really, and that limited how much coding people could learn. So for years I just kept wondering what would happen if someone made that magic hierarchical declarative shape unlimited by merging it with a traditional imperative programming language. Would it allow gamers to accidentally fall into learning actual coding? It took me about 2 years to squash together these two seemingly-opposed paradigms and make the Easel programming language. Doing this required slimming down on the other language features in order to iterate quickly on this big problem, so that's how we ended up not having strong typing, amongst other things. But I don't regret what I chose to prioritise, and I hope to address this in the coming years! reply",

I can say \"now add X\" and it'll do it. Generally with good results. But when it comes to maintaining existing systems, or adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details, a LLM is usually not that great for me. They're still great as a code suggestion tool, finishing lines and functions. But as far as delivering whole features, they're pretty useless once you get past the easy stuff. And you'll spend as much time directing the LLM to do this kind of this as you would just writing it yourself. What I tend to do is write stubbed out code in the design I like, then I'll get an LLM to just fill in the gaps. These people who say LLMs make them 100x more productive probably are only working on greenfield stuff and haven't got to the hard bit yet. Like everyone says, the first 90% is the easy bit. The last 10% is where you'll spend most of your time, and I don't see LLMs doing the hard bit that well currently. reply",

It will not. And I say this as someone whose been building internal LLM tools since 2021. The issue is their context window. If you increase the context window so they can see more code costs skyrocket as n^2 the size of the code base. If you don't then you have all the issues people have in this thread. The reason why I have a job right now is that you can get around this by building tooling for intelligent search that limits the overfill of each context window. This is neither easy, fast, or cheap when done at scale. Worse the problems that you have when doing this are at best very weakly related to the problems the major AI labs are focusing on currently - I've interviewed at two of the top five AI labs and none of the people I talked to cared or really understood what a _real_ agentic system that solves coding should look like. reply",

          "text": "For general text you run some type of vector search against the full-text corpus to see what relevant hits there are and where. Then you feed the first round of results into a ranking/filtering system which does pair wise comparison between each chunk that you've had a good score from the vector search. Contract/expand until you've reach the limit of the context window for your model and run against the original query. For source code, you are even luckier since there are a lot of deterministic tools which provide solid grounding, e.g., etags, and the languages themselves enforce a hierarchical tree-like structure on the source code, viz. block statements. The above means that ranking and chunking strategies are solved already - which is a huge pain for general text. The vector search is then just an enrichment layer on top which brings in documentation and other soft grounding text that keeps the LLM from going berserk. Of course, none of the commercial offerings come even close to letting you do this well. Even the dumb version of search needs to be a self-recursive agent which comes with a good set of vector embeddings and the ability to decide if it's searched enough before it starts answering your questions.

          "text": "> For greenfield it’s amazing I'll preface this comment with: I am a recent startup owner (so only dev, which is important) and my entire codebase has been generated via Sonnet (mostly 3.7, now using 4.0). If you actually looked at the work I'm (personally) producing, I guess I'm more of a product-owner/project-manager as I'm really just overseeing the development. > I have yet to see an LLM-generated app not collapse under it’s own weight after enough iterations/prompts. There's a few crucial steps to make an LLM-generated app maintainable (by the LLM): - _have a very, very strong SWE background_; ideally as a \"strong\" Lead Dev, _this is critical_ - your entire workflow NEEDS to be centered around LLM-development (or even model-specific): - use MCPs wherever possible and make sure they're specifically configured for your project\n\n  - don't write \"human\" documentation; use rule + reusable prompt files\n\n  - you MUST do this in a *very* granular but specialized way; keep rules/prompts very small (like you would when creating tickets)\n\n  - make sure rules are conditionally applied (using globs); do not auto include anything except your \"system rules\"\n\n  - use the LLM to generate said prompts and rules; this forces consistency across prompts, very important\n\n  - follow a typical agile workflow (creating epics, tickets, backlogs etc)\n\n  - TESTS TESTS AND MORE TESTS; add automated tools (like linters) EVERYWHERE you can\n\n  - keep your code VERY modular so the LLM can keep a focused context, rules should provide all key context (like the broader architecture); the goal is for your LLM to only need to read or interact with files related to the strict 'current task' scope\n\n  - iterating on code is almost always more difficult than writing it from scratch: provided your code is well architected, no single rewrite should be larger than a regular ticket (if the ticket is too large then it needs to be split up) This is off the top of my head so it's pretty broad/messy but I can expand on my points. LLM-coding requires a complete overhaul of your workflow so it is tailored specifically to an LLM, not a human, but this is also a massive learning curve (that take's a lot of time to figure out and optimize). Would I bother doing this if I were still working on a team? Probably not, I don't think it would've saved me much time in a \"regular\" codebase. As a single developer at a startup? This is the only way I've been able to get \"other startup-y\" work done while also progressing the codebase - the value of being able to do multiple things at a time, let the LLM and intermittently review the output while you get to work on other things. The biggest tip I can give: LLMs struggle at \"coding like a human\" and are much better at \"bad-practice\" workflows (e.g. throwing away large parts of code in favour of a total rewrite) - let the LLM lead the development process, with the rules/prompts as guardrails, and try stay out of it's way while it works (instead of saying \"hey X thing didn't work, go fix that now\") - hold its hand but let it experiment before jumping in. reply",

Greenfield != boilerplate and basic CRUD app. I'm a consultant writing greenfield apps solo, and 90% of my time is spent away from my editor thinking, planning, designing, meeting with stakeholders. I see no benefit in using a low-IQ autocomplete tool to automate a small part of the remaining 10% of the job, the easiest and most enjoyable part in fact. Personally I find most of coding I do is unsuitable for LLMs anyway, because I don't need them to regurgitate standard logic when libraries are available, so most of that 10% is writing business logic tailored for the program/client. Call me elitist (I don't care) but LLMs are mostly useful to two kinds of people: inexperienced developers, and those that think that hard problems are solved with more code. After almost two decades writing software, I find I need fewer and fewer code to ship a new project, most of my worth is thinking hard away from a keyboard. I really don't see the use of a machine that egregiously and happily writes a ton of code. Less is more, and I appreciate programming-as-an-art rather than being a code monkey paid by the line of code I commit.

Just asking it \"Where does the check for X take place\" where there's tons of inheritance and auto-constructor magic in a codebase I rarely touch, it does a pretty good job of showing me the flow of logic. reply",

This makes later refactoring or upgrades across multiple projects less automatable (sometimes this can be solved by having an LLM do those, but they often are unsuccessful in some projects still) 3. LLMs have a knowledge cutoff. If your company has already moved to a version after that knowledge cutoff, you need to upgrade the LLM generated code.

Hell, only engineers know that the devil is in the details. Quick example: let’s say a Contact Us page needs to be built. There are tons of details that need to be accounted for and the LLM may skip them if it is not told about them: where does the data of the form go to? A backend endpoint? What about captcha? What about analytics? What about validation of specific fields? What about the friendly URL? And disabling the button after sending to prevent duplicate requests? An LLM is very capable of implementing all of that… if only someone who knows all of that stuff tell them first. And most importantly: LLMs don’t challenge the task given. Engineers do.

          "text": "A little snarky but: In my experience, the folks who are 100x more productive are multiplying 100 times a small number. I've found great success with LLMs in the research phase of coding.  Last week I  needed to write some domain-specific linear algebra and because of some other restrictions, I couldn't just pull in LAPACK. So I had to hand code the work (yes, I know you shouldn't hand code this kind of stuff, but it was a small slice and the domain didn't require the fully-optimized LAPACK stuff).  I used an LLM to do the research part that I normally would have had to resort to a couple of math texts to fully understand.  So in that case it did make me 100x more effective because it found what I needed and summarized it so that I could convert it to code really quickly. For the fun of it, I did ask the LLM to generate the code for me too, and it made very subtle mistakes that wouldn't have been obvious unless you were already an expert in the field.  I could see how a junior engineer would have been impressed by it and probably just check it in and go on. I'm still a firm believer in understanding every bit of code you check in, so even if LLMs get really good, the \"code writing\" part of my work probably won't ever get faster.  But for figuring out what code to write - I think LLMs will make people much faster.  The research and summarize part is amazing. The real value in the world is synthesis and novel ideas.  And maybe I'm a luddite, but I still think that takes human creativity.  LLMs will be a critical support structure, but I'm not sold on them actually writing high-value code. reply",

It obviously isn't 100x or even 10x except for very specific toy tasks, but for me it's probably around ~1.5-2x in everyday work. And I work on mostly long-tail scientific stuff, I imagine it's more if you do something like frontend dev with a lot of boilerplate. I'm absolutely convinced that people who say LLMs are not making them more productive either don't understand how to use them correctly, or they are working on very specific niche problems/infrastructure where they aren't useful. 2x may not sound like much compared to what you read in the media, but if a few years ago you had told companies that you can provably make their engineers even 2x more productive on average you'd probably be swimming in billions of dollars now. That kind of productivity increase is absolutely huge. reply",

It’s valuable to have it talk through something or explain why something is designed a certain way. So it’s definitely helped me grow as an engineer.

Because for the most part being a computer programmer is not about programming the computer but about… everything else. Overall, LLM are a net negative for humanity in my opinion. The amount of slop on the internet now is absurd. I can never be sure if I’m reading the writing of a real person or a machine, which makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming brain poisoned by the devil himself on a psychological level. I have to think twice when I read any email longer than 2 paragraphs, or did my coworker start using more em dashes? And also if it’s so damn easy for a machine to do all of this complex valuable work for a few kilojoules how complex or valuable is it anyway? Maybe it’s all just a fiction, that any of this stuff provides any value to anyone. Is another app really actually necessary? What about a hundred million new apps?! Even if we all became 100x as “productive,” what would that actually mean, in the real world you know the one that’s outside that has smells and textures and objects and people in it talking to one another face to face with their wet vocal chords??

I just can never remember things like syntax, specifics, that sort of thing. It doesn't help that I often wind up in jobs where I'm switching between languages often.

Take autocomplete suggestions for instance: Sometimes it's exactly the prompt (pardon the pun) that I need to jog my memory. Other times I know it's not what i want and I ignore it.

A few years I did it with something similar to Math Academy (from the Universiteit of Amsterdam). ChatGPT wasn't intelligent enough back then so I didn't use it. It felt a lot tougher. ChatGPT answers questions that a teacher would find obscure nonsense, but I'm the type of student that needs to know the culture behind math so I can empathize with the people doing it and can think of solutions via that way. Like why is the letter m used when talked about an angle? Mathematically, it shouldn't matter. But it irritates me as I'd use a instead, it makes more sense as you want to lower the cognitive burden and focus as much on the math as possible. So I ask ChatGPT and one of the things it said is that historically it meant \"measure\". Now, I get it and can focus on the actual math again. Another example is the fast variance calculation: average_of_squares - square_of_the_average how does that come from (1/n) * sum((x - mean)^2) ? It just shows it. World domination? Nope, but I'm learning something I otherwise wouldn't. But as you can tell, YouTube and Math Academy play their own roll in it. reply",

          "text": "Is it? I didn't bother to check as it wasn't too relevant. I wasn't stuck anymore. Worst-case it's a memnonic that is untrue. Best case: it is. For actual derivations I check the work. This is what it wrote by the way. I posted an image and asked: Why is this m m for angle\nmangle? ChatGPT: In geometry we often need to distinguish the angle itself (a geometric object) from the numerical size of that angle (a real-number measurement, usually in degrees or radians).\nTo keep the two ideas separate we put a little “m” in front of the angle symbol: m∠B reads as “the measure of angle B.” * ∠B refers to the actual wedge-shaped region determined by the two rays that meet at vertex . * m∠B is the single number—e.g. \\90∘—that tells you how “wide” that wedge is. So in the worked example the author writes m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360∘ because they are adding the sizes of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral, not the angles themselves. If you dropped the m you’d be adding geometric objects, which doesn’t make sense; the m reminds the reader that what’s being added are real-number measures. (Some textbooks use ∣∠B∣ or simply write the letter with a bar over it, but “m∠” is by far the most common in U.S. and many international curricula.) So the mysterious “m” isn’t another variable—just a shorthand for “measure of.” --- Edit: this took quite some work to write well as ChatGPT answers don't copy/paste neatly into HN. So I won't be doing this for the other example. reply",

          "text": "ChatGPT is right, although I'm not sure how historical the notation is. ∠ is traditionally a function from points to axiomatic geometric objects. ∠ABC is the angle at B oriented so that we start at A, go to B, then to C. Your text seems to be using ∠ either as a kind of type annotation (indicating by ∠B that B is an angle) or (perhaps more likely) is just suppressing the other letters in the triangle and is short for something like ∠ABC. Since ∠B is an axiomatic Euclidean object, it has no particular relation to the real numbers. m is an operator or function that maps axiomatic angles to real numbers in such a way that the calculations with real numbers provide a model for the Euclidean geometry. Why call it m? I'm not aware of it being historical, but almost certainly it comes from measure, like the μ in measure theory. Obviously ∠ is a graphical depiction of an angle, and my guess is it probably evolved as a shorthand from the more explicit diagrams in Euclid. Traditionally angles are named with variables from the beginning of the Greek alphabet: α, β, γ. Then we skip to θ presumably to avoid the Greek letters that look nearly identical to Roman letters. reply",

          "text": "> I was criticized for pointing out spurious nonsense in LLM slop I can see that you experience it as such but I think it's more of a spectrum. Often times, LLMs give good answers. Often enough times they don't. One needs to keep that in mind. In my example, given that it was just a symbol, all I needed was knowledge at the level of a memnonic which would, on average, at least somewhat also point directionally to the truth. But that's a bonus. I could make up a memnonic myself, but I like having that bonus. Given that ChatGPT is directionally towards the truth, but not fully (on average), I'd need to test it or verify it if I want a better level of knowledge than that. If that's the case, then ChatGPT is basically acts as a sort of cache as it's quicker to ask a question to ChatGPT than to research on one's own. One can experience a cache hit or cache miss. Such a thing will happen in the verification stage. Specifically, for math this is quicker, in my experience. But anyways that's my experience. Your experience is that it's spurious nonsense slop. And I suppose you therefore find it a problem. I don't see the issue as there are different levels of knowledge and different time commitments you need to give to them. A lot of my knowledge is based on trust anyway and sometimes it's broken (e.g. replication crisis in psychology, I felt betrayed having studied the field). > I don't know why anyone would think they are owed a custom explanation for their specific questions I'm not sure if anyone said anything like it. Regardless of that, the need still exists. People will still act on that need. I suspect you see that as a problem. I'm neutral on it. > thinking like that will get you in trouble when you come to depend on what anyone (or anything) is willing to chew up for you. IMO teaching and learning is a 2 way street. It's the teacher's job to explain it well enough. It's the student's job to do their best to understand it. Math Academy offers exercises and explanations. Sometimes I find their explanations a bit lacking. So I use other sources to augment it. > Maybe I was terse but I don't think I was rude or illogical.

I think it's helpful to think of engineering as a _process_ instead of a role, and the reality is that a lot of development work doesn't necessarily rely on the strong engineering methodology (e.g. measurement, material properties, tolerances, modelling, etc.) that the people developing the software might imagine just based on the number of job adverts for 'engineers'. This isn't a bad thing. There are hundreds or thousands of different but equally valid solutions to getting a program to do a thing, but not recognising that most code writing is somewhere between a art and engineering and is neither a purely artistic discipline but also rarely a purely engineering one is useful. The kinds of engineering and architecture that people think of in software development only really represent common practices and shared language (e.g. design patterns, architectural patterns) and not a strong engineering practice or any kind of truth about how software actually runs. (Unless you're writing software for launching rockets, in which case the engineering _process_ porbably should be strong). reply",

Watching my coworkers fumble with terrible copilot autoshit in a pairing session makes me want to scream on a daily basis.  That doesn’t necessarily mean such a DX is the only way it could or should work, or that it’s even a good DX at all.  Most of the time, it actually imposes more cost, both in lost momentum and in corrective action, than it relieves. I think something like a graph where nodes are specified clearly with inputs and outputs (or pre- and post-conditions, if you prefer), and agents iteratively generate and refine the implementation details could have some utility, but that would require programmers to know how to think about program design (and have a usable UI/UX for such a tool) instead of hastily stumbling through patches and modifications to existing code they already don’t understand. The new LLM systems are carrying us farther from that world, not closer to it. reply",

It feels more like I’m chasing my tail, vibe coding as they say, it’s just seems endlessly circular. My game dev is going to be a hybrid approach going forward. I’ll ask it to create a new project with the desired functionality and see how the solution was proposed and then incorporate that into my main code branch. I find this easier than the Cursor roll back or being overly cautious with suggested edits. I’m just getting to this realization so tbd if it works well.

Or the open source alternatives. That’s where people are seeing actual gains today. Why go all-in on anti-hype without talking about your direct experience? reply",

You get better output when your inputs are tuned to the scenario. Some of your inputs in this paradigm could be considered as optional parameters because you still get output without them. If you need to remember parts of the inputs in between user sessions then you need to save state of those somewhere to a disk. Databases are a common choice especially in web development but you could also just put things in a file. Another option if this isn't a web development context is to use something like sqlite since it will help organize the data a little better than say CSVs or similar. reply",

          "text": "Proper usage of LLMs so you don't just flood them with useless context will just be custom tailored prompts that only include the pertinent context, with prompts saying how it's related to what you're looking for. I don't think there's a cheap way around it maybe on the plus side you can tune them using ai code. \nI think tools are really over used and over-rated and have had horrible experience with them, nothing beats just custom tailoring stuff and setting up a system around it. What I do is use elixir pheonix, have a genserver keep track of the user state and I just include the related state in the request and just helper functions to generate the related prompts per type of state/context and append them wherever makes the most sense. I think LLMs make most sense to be viewed of as singular atomic interactions where you have the whole input (prompt/context/data) and get a concrete output. Everything else just seems like people being lazy trying to avoid thinking about the best way of structuring it. Where you put the context/data and how you include it will vary per prompt or the specific atomic interaction, there is no standard rule each interaction is unique. You have to experiment and see what provides the best output for each kind of request. I'd read Anthropics prompting docs if you haven't it's very good. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-... My way of thinking is just viewing every isolated LLM request as a unique function that is\nthe prompt + llm = a unique function\nContext is just what data you pass into the function (prompt+llm+settings(temp, etc))(data) to get whatever specific output you want. The prompt includes prewriting user/system messages, system prompt, structured output stuff or whatever. Any single request might lead to 1 or 30 of these that feed back into each other. \nBut yeah based on that it depends on just custom tailoring them for anything, it's pretty conceptual and intellectual but I find it fun but I don't think there's any easy way around it. Having the ability to have all your requests be stateful and modify what goes into the prompt based on the current user state (like genservers/elixir makes very easy) is a nice technical thing that helps though. reply",

I was specifically allowed to use company resources to develop the software (including reasonable time my manager signed off on) and in return the company would get a non-exclusive perpetual right to use and modify the software as they saw fit. This contract was a win-win.  My company got the features they wanted as part of my normal employment, but I also got to keep the idea and monetize it outside the company if I wanted to.  The company didn't need to worry about licensing if I left since I granted a perpetual right to use/modify. Unfortunately for various reasons the project never got completed and I never monotized it, so I can't tell you the real-world outcome, but I do know we were all happy with the terms going into it. reply",

          "text": "Mentioning that you negotiated to keep your code from falling under \"works for hire\" does a lot of heavy lifting in this (very well packed) example. I recommend that the OP dig into what \"works for hire\" means in the US to get a sense of what they should negotiate [to avoid]. It can definitely be a win/win for the company as well as for an enterprising engineer. The general idea is simply to go outside the scope of your contract and do something the company didn't ask for, in exchange for a bit of money and the right to reuse whatever code you developed for them. Avoiding works for hire contracts is how I built a 25 year war chest of reusable components and frameworks, each piece commissioned to an individual task but each used and modified in my next jobs for my next clients, until many versions later I would update my original clients with them. My advice to OP is to always present your ideas to owners or managers with open ears, and explain how it will help the company. Secondly, never do the work for free. Thirdly, always retain your rights to your ideas and your code when you're working on something creative. If they have a problem with that you can also explain that it's unlikely anyone else will either fill this niche to save them money or that any competitor will ever actually know about or use what you will build for them, but that having it at your disposal is a way for you to continue increasing their efficiency (which is true). It's also a way to make them beholden to you at very little initial cost. reply",

Formalizing the idea while employed and then taking it outside could be trouble.  Probably worth discussing details with a lawyer before attempting.

          "text": "Quick suggestion: maybe contact the vendor company and offer to create a frontend for them instead as a contract thing? --- I've gone through the exact scenarion in your question though, this is roughly the path I took (Estonia & EU, YMMV in other jurisdictions): - start by going over your contract - is this overall even allowed? Some companies capture all IP you create 24/7, in this case you'll need to get the contract changed or get an exception - even if your contract allows doing other work (creating separate IP) outside of company time, still ask for written permission from your manager and possibly a skip level or two. I got a written email from my VP of eng and CTO before proceeding. - you will probably need to _completely_ separate your own work from the company work. This means using your personal laptop, never working on this during work hours, etc. Separating this sometimes can be hard, especially if you get something like a bug report from your employer - you can't work with it until you're off the clock. - I also completely cut myself off from the purchasing decision - I let them know I was working on a project, gave them a landing page and let the purchasing team do a decision completely on their own - if you hope to build a business out of this it's best to be upfront about it, e.g. by telling your manager that you might leave to focus on the business full-time if it takes off All of this assumes you're on good terms with your employer overall. reply",

          "text": "IANAL either. I believe that UK law would be similar to that in Australia. To the best of my understanding, as an employee the IP of all work you produce is owned by the company. Even as a contractor you need rather specific contracts if your work for hire is not to be owned by the client. My first reaction is to advise you to let the idea go. The most likely outcome is that you will do a huge amount of work and then get caught up in legal nightmares. Getting legal advice up front won't spare you from more drama down the track. Assuming that there are many companies that use the same software and have similar needs, then you have the option of leaving, developing a MVP and then selling it to other companies first and eventually to your ex-employer.  Even then there are risks of being accused of taking proprietary information to enrich yourself. Another scenario is that the big-name company could beat you to the market with a poorly designed but aggressively marketed alternative to your solution. reply",

No one demands complete unconditional loyalty, but there should be some unwritten codes (regardless of what's written in your contract) People who value their freedom should not be salaried employees. Start yr own business & do whatever u want. With caveats, in some jurisdictions employees are much better protected by law than businesses or self-employed consultants/contractors, & companies often ask the latter to sign more draconian contracts, NDAs, and non-competes (viewing them as potential competitors). U can always negotiate, but there are less scurpolous businesses & consultants who will sign any contract just to get the project/deal, & that's lowers the bar for everyone reply",

Talk to your execs (ideally, the CEO) directly and sell this. On failure, be prepared to work on this internally. If so, ask for more money/promotion, which may not work but will not hurt either. 2. Call the other company and offer to improve their product for more money/promotion. 3. Get a techie friend to front for you: he approaches your company, you do the work, he shares the money.

And then the entrepreneurial answer is to skip all that, go build it yourself, then sell it to many organizations. But you probably cannot do that as an employee, depending on your employment contract. So sure, the surface levels answers are to talk to a lawyer, your manager, etc. But the deeper answer is to decide on and commit to a direction - are you happy being an employee, or do you need to walk out and start your own thing? (And as a side note, don't build a startup that is a front-end to someone else's product. It may fill a need, but you are going to be spending all your hours keeping up with their changes, and ultimately your success is tied to their decisions and they could wipe you out just by spending a month improving their UX.) reply",

If it's something that's specific to your company and there is no market outside it, you have one customer that at the same time has strong leverage over you due to your current employment. If it's something that could be generally useful, you likely still don't have a market: if your product ever became popular, the big-name company selling the original software could add it as a feature or paid extension and would have a huge marketing advantage over you. The company you currently work for will likely not be willing to pay much for your work, and might take offense and fire you if you try to negotiate too hard. They could also decide that your new job is writing this thing... You could try to leverage it for a bonus or promotion or something like that. That's unlikely to capture a significant amount of the value you provide, but so are the other options. If you think the idea in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44080196 will fly, you could try that. I think it's unlikely to fly but it's the option that likely pays out best if it does fly, and if you approach it carefully (\"this is outside the scope of my role and my department, but I could do it in my free time\"), you might be able to pull it off with limited risk. You also need to understand how decision processes work at your company and optimize your proposal for it. If it's more work to get legal to approve the contract with you than to get approval to pay 10x as much to the original vendor to add something half as good as a feature, the vendor gets the job. reply",

          "text": "All decisions/actions have a “ceiling” and a “floor”, the best possible outcome and the worst. Let’s consider them for this situation. Ceiling - Company buys your software - You sell it to other companies - This becomes your full time job Floor - Fired - Trust lost, future advancement blocked (not saying it’s right, just that it could happen) Also important are how likely the outcomes are. Looking at the above and my own experience working at companies, having side projects, and selling them, I think you are much closer to the floor than the ceiling (in probability). Here are some hard truths: - Even if something is a win-win, many companies will not see it that way. They often react negatively to things they don’t understand or are uncommon. - Depending on where you work it might be impossible to develop a side project without the company owning the IP (sometimes you can get a special waiver but not if it has overlap with what your company does) - How capable are you of writing this software and are you really sure you have the problem/solution well understood? I don’t want to be rude but it sounds like you saw one presentation and think you can build and sell a solution that’s not spec’d out. I’m also not sure if your skill set, have you created software like this on your own before? - Just because people are enthusiastic about the prospect of this tool doesn’t mean they are willing to pay for it (or will even still be interested 1 day, 1 week, 1 month from now) - Developing software for a company (as an employee) and developing on your own are 2 different sets of skills. There is overlap, but it’s not the same - Sales/Marketing and running a business are a completely different set of skills. It’s rare to have a developer who can also do this well. Not impossible, just rare. - If you aren’t passionate about this then even if you are successful, you will not be happy. Employee? Work on whatever, no problem. Contractor? Work on whatever. Sole proprietor? Make sure it’s something you enjoy/care about. Maybe you do care about YAML file GUIs. At a minimum I would wait 2-4 weeks and gauge interest in the tool again. See if people are still super interested or if it’s “Huh? Oh yeah, ehh, it was just something that would be cool but we wouldn’t pay for it”. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, think everyone is as excited as you, then find out later they don’t care. Also use this time to see if the project still interests YOU. If, after all of this, you still want to pursue this then make sure to check your employment contract and even if there is nothing about side-projects/IP get _written_ approval from your manager. Lastly, ignore the people here suggesting you do anything “sneaky”, like the “I have a friend who is developing software that does this”. This is no way to live and those chickens will come home to roost. Either the company will catch you and/or you will be committing some kind of crime if you do obscure it. In all honesty there is a _very_ low chance that this is worth pursuing. I know personally how easy it can be to get caught up in an idea like this but the chances of it working out are low. Maybe in a better world they would be higher but I’ve seen enough to assume that the company will respond _poorly_ even to a well reasoned and mutually advantageous offer. It sucks, but that’s just the reality of most places. Even if your company is not like this, it still might be better for you to just pitch working on it internally and leverage a bonus/raise/title. reply",

          "text": "Persevere. Get emotionally invested. Be a little stubborn. Commit 100%. As investors say, strong opinions, weakly held. The stages of grief are a biological checklist: 1. Denial: Is it a measurement error? A fluke? Not enough time? Unexpected disadvantage? 2. Anger: Am I a coward for abandoning this? Why did I do this in the first place? Does the new path go against my moral values? 3. Bargaining: Is there a way around this problem? Do I need to give up or can I concede something? 4. Depression: At this point, you accept it is over. Mourn the idea. Have some kind of ritual. Blog about failure. Separate from it cleanly. The trick is to approach each stage logically . People tend to be completely irrational. They'll call the data fake, blame the sources, blame luck, blame privilege, government, etc. People get stuck on this for years. They become scared of failure. They burn through the passion, then rely on discipline. Then they burn through the discipline too and settle wherever they are. Go through the grief, but treat it like a form. You have to deal with each stage, especially depression and the burial of that goal. Sometimes you get stuck at bargaining - \"I'll come back to this project later.\" reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have talked to a number of people regarding this. The classic pivot vs persevere problem. 1) My view is that you don't/can't really know in advance. Most of the examples you see/hear about are retrospective, and suffers from survivorship bias and/or positive reporting bias. Ex. Typically, you only hear about how people's decisions led to success. Or you only hear about earlier failures if the subject later succeeded. What you don't hear about are other people who made similar choices and still failed. Unless you're connected to these builders/founders networks and have insider-access/great rapport, it'll be difficult for you to get exposed to the hidden, unreported side. 2) What's worth analyzing are the material consequences of whatever outcome/decision path. One thing you do want to avoid is anything that could take you out of the game, so to speak. Like huge financial obligations, etc. 3) And most decisions aren't so black and white. There's a very large, gray area in between where you could get real creative. In this gray area are 3rd options where you could be positioning yourself for long-term sustainability to work on whatever it is on your mind. Sometimes I call it \"pivot to persevere.\" Ex. creating another venture B to fund venture A. reply",

Which means that everybody uses them but few people are able to develop them from scratch. It's not different from other things like databases, GPU drivers, 3D engines for games, etc. That all involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math. But lots of people use these things without being hindered by such skills. It probably helps a little to understand some of the internals and math. Just to get a feel for what the limitations are. But your job as a software engineer is probably to stick things together and bang on them until they work. I sometimes describe what I do as being a glorified plumber. It requires skills but surprisingly few skills related to math and algorithms. That stuff comes in library form mostly. So, get good at using LLMs and integrating what they do into agentic systems. Figure out APIs, limitations, and learn about different use cases. Because we'll all be doing a lot of work related to that in the next few years. reply",

Plus I’ve already seen some local companies just buy a beefy GPU server and deploy an open LLM model. While OpenAI is still trying to push quality, their competitors have already positioned themselves to offer the lowest possible prices. And since Nvidia has no easy path for scaling up compute anymore, I also wouldn’t bet on much larger LLMs anytime soon. That means, if you learn more about the internals of LLMs, your market angle is going to be artisanal customised models. Fashion is commoditised, but people still pay for a custom tailored suit. In the same way companies will continue to pay for finetunes optimised for their business usecase. If you decide to focus more on the application of LLMs, you should really invest into high-level architectural skills. Good “code completion” models can already do what an outsourced 10 bucks per hour developer used to do. Your job in the future is going to be to decide the structure of which fuse and against the towel and or which type of state is being stored and managed. But the actual coding of the UI forms and the glue code to synchronise from an SQL query to the client state, that part is probably going to be fully outsourced to LLMs. reply",

          "text": "My 2 centes: 1. Learn basic NNs at a simple level, build from scratch (no frameworks) a feed forward neural network with back propagation to train against MNIST or something as simple. Understand every part of it. Just use your favorite programming language. 2. Learn (without having to implement with the code, or to understand the finer parts of the implementations) how the NN architectures work and why they work. What is an encoder-decoder? Why the first part produces an embedding? How a transformer works? What are the logits in the output of an LLM, and how sampling works? Why is attention of quadratic? What is Reinforcement Learning, Resnets, how do they work? Basically: you need a solid qualitative understanding of all that. 3. Learn the higher level layer, both from the POV of the open source models, so how to interface to llama.cpp / ollama / ..., how to set the context window, what is quantization and how it will affect performances/quality of output, and also, how to use popular provider APIs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, ... and what model is good for what. 4. Learn prompt engineering techniques that influence the qualtily of the output when using LLMs programmatically (as a bag of algorithms). This takes patience and practice. 5. Learn how to use AI effectively for coding. This is absolutely non-trivial, and a lot of good programmers are terrible LLMs users (and end believing LLMs are not useful for coding). 6. Don't get trapped into the idea that the news of the day (RAG, MCP, ...) is what you should spend all your energy. This is just some useful technology surrounded by a lot of hype of all the people that want to get rich with AI and understand they can't compete with the LLMs themselves. So they pump the part that can be kinda \"productized\". Never forget that the product is the neural network itself, for the most part. reply",

A full-stack engineer will likely have at least a solid understanding of the HTTP protocol, HTTPS, WebSockets, the interface layer between the frontend server and their chosen Web webdev stack, and so on.

I’ve noticed that Gemini 2.5 Pro seems way dumber when used in the Copilot agent, vs me just running all the required context through OpenRouter in Continue.dev. The former doesn’t produce usable iOS tests, while the latter was almost perfect. On the surface, it looks like those should be doing the same thing; but internally, it seems that they are not. And I guess that means I should just use Continue, but they broke something and my workflow doesn’t work anymore. And people keep saying you need to make a plan first, and then let the agent implement it. Well I did, and had a few markdown files that described the task well. But Copilot‘s Agent didn’t manage to write this Swift code in a way that actually works - everything was subtly off and wrong, and untangling would have taken longer than rewriting it.

          "text": "Agreed with most of this except the last point. You are never going to make a foundational model, although you may contribute to one. Those foundational models are the product, yes, but if I could use an analogy: foundational models are like the state of the art 3D renderers in games. You still need to build the game. Some 3D renderers are used/licensed for many games. Even the basic chat UI is a structure built around a foundational model; the model itself has no capability to maintain a chat thread. The model takes context and outputs a response, every time. For more complex processes, you need to carefully curate what context to give the model and when. There are many applications where you can say \"oh, chatgpt can analyze your business data and tell you how to optimize different processes\", but good luck actually doing that. That requires complex prompts and sequences of LLM calls (or other ML models), mixed with well-defined tools that enable the AI to return a useful result. This forms the basis of AI engineering - which is different from developing AI models - and this is what most software engineers will be doing in the next 5-10 years. This isn't some kind of hype that will die down as soon as the money gets spent, a la crypto. People will create agents that automate many processes, even within software development itself. This kind of utility is a no-brainer for anyone running a business, and hits deeply in consumer markets as well. Much of what OpenAI is currently working on is building agents around their own models to break into consumer markets.

          "text": "Kinda surprised of that, actually. Sure, I get that research interest in any if the \"traditional\" ML methods (SVMs, markov models, decision trees, that kind of stuff) is probably essentially dead right now, but I had thought interest in neural networks and \"understanding\" what LLMs do internally to be ballooning. I could imagine that even those \"ancient\" techniques might some day make a comeback. They're far inferior to LLMs in terms of expressive power, but they also require literally orders of magnitude less memory and computation power. So when the hype dies down, interest in solutions that don't require millions in hardware cost or making your entire business dependent on what Sam Altman and Donald Trump had for breakfast might have a resurgence. Also, interestingly enough, LLMs could even help in this area: Most of those old techniques require an abundance of labeled training data, which was always hard to achieve in practice. However, LLMs are great at either labeling existing data or generating new synthetic data that those systems could train on. reply",

Same with coding stacks. There are plenty of ways to use what's available now, as \"tools\". Play around, see what they can do for you now, see where it might lead.

The first group is definitely not hype. Their core business relies on ML and they don’t need hype for that to be true. For the second group, it depends on the business model. The fact that you can make an API call doesn’t mean anything. What matters is solving a customer problem.

If you're early in your career, it must feel like you're staring at a technological fork in the road, with AI standing there ominously, waving both paths like it's the final boss in a RPG game. Between your two options, I’d lean toward continuing to build what you’re good at and using AI as a powerful tool, unless you genuinely feel pulled toward the internals and research side. I’ve been lucky to build a fun career in IT, where the biggest threats used to be Y2K, the dot-com bubble, and predictions that mobile phones would kill off PCs. (Spoiler: PCs are still here, and so am I.) The real question is: what are you passionate enough about to dive into with energy and persistence? That’s what will make the learning worth it. Everything else is noise in my opinion. If I had to start over today, I'd definitely be in the same uncertain position, but I know I'd still just pick a direction and adapt to the challenges that come with it. That’s the nature of the field. Definitely learn the fundamentals of how these AI tools work (like understanding how AI tools process context or what transformers actually do). But don’t feel like you need to dive head-first into gradient descent to be part of the future. Focus on building real-world solutions, where AI is a tool, not the objective. And if a cheese grater gets the job done, don’t get bogged down reverse-engineering its rotational torque curves. Just grate the cheese and keep cooking.

Or, if you believe there may be some merit to \"AI is coming for your job\" meme, but really don't want to do blue collar / skilled trades work, at least go in with the mindset of \"the people who build, operate, and maintain the AI systems will probably stay employed at least a little bit longer than the people don't\".

With low demand for AI internals and a high supply of talent—many people have earned data science certificates in AI hoping to land lucrative jobs at OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.—the bar for accessing these few roles is very high. 2/ The risk here is AI makes everyone good at full-stack. This means more competition for roles, less demand for roles (now 1 in-experienced engineer with AI, can output 1.5x the code an experience Senior engineer could do in 2020). In the short/medium term, 2/ has the best risk/reward function. But 1/ is more future proof. Another important question is where are you in your career? If you're 45 years old, I'd encourage you to switch into leadership roles for 2/. This wont be replaced by AI. If you're early in your career, it could make more sense to switch. reply",

          "text": "Hi, I am working in making the term \"llm developer\" more popular in France and train people to this new job.\nWe will need a bunch of them in the months/years to come to implement advanced AI systems after companies manage to properly pick and set up their AI platforms. Currently people would tend to involve data scientists into this job, but data scientists are often less versed into the software engineering aspect, eg when they work more on notebooks than web apps.\nThe job is akin to being a web developer, so a \"normal\" developer but specialized in a certain field. Knowing the internals of LLMs is a big bonus, but you can start your journey with treating them as black box tools and still craft relevant solutions. You'll need to learn about running systems with databases (vector, graph, relational and nosql are all useful) and plugging multiple services together (docker, kubernetes, cloud hosting). reply",

Was it worth learning the model of SO site, or Google, in order to become a good dev? I guess, no. LLMs jobs in this analogy are like becoming search engine developer. Completely different area, and different career, I guess. To upgrade a CV and just skills, I would suggest learning another backend language, like Go or Rust, if they're not on your CV already. I chose Rust, and it boosted my understanding of what's happening in code. You may also choose Go, and offer speed boosts for Python/JS backend code, as many employers are more willing to use it than Rust. I hesitated to do that, and turned out, I was wrong, and I could have offered impressive speed boosts at one of my jobs, where background jobs would work for hours. This can be any tech that is near, but feels like beyond a barrier, and people hesitate trying it. As for other jobs - take a look at college/uni teaching: it brings status (if you do it more, even tangible titles), and boosts social network, which will yield crops in 5-15 years. Another thing is something that requires certification. This is what people hesitate to try or fail at tests. Jobs protected by certificates are supposedly more secure. And learning as an adult is much cooler, because now you've seen yourself learn stuff on your own and can apply methods to the process. reply",

Without AGENTS.md, it seems to go of the wrong end really quickly, and end up with subpar code. But with a little bit of guidance, I do get some results at least. This is the current AGENTS.md I'm using for some smaller projects: https://gist.github.com/victorb/1fe62fe7b80a64fc5b446f82d313... With that said, it does get mislead sometimes, and the UX isn't great for the web version. It's really slow, you can't customize the environment, the UI seems to load data in a really weird way leading to slowdowns and high latencies, and overall it's just cumbersome. My homegrown version is way faster for the iterations, + has stateful PRs it can iterate on and receive line comment feedback on, but the local models I'm using are obviously worse than the OpenAI ones, so I'd still say Codex is probably overall better, sadly. reply",

It's an open source web framework I have been working  on ( https://github.com/adamritter/pageql ). To tell you the truth it slowed down yesterday as most of the features were done and I had to fix memory/signal/callback leaks, but even that was done much faster than if I did it by hand.

Engineering solutions with LLM is a lot of fiddling,\nwhich is experimental rather than analytical/logical. It is worth getting use to that mind-set, and then use LLMs as a tool (they are likely here to stay, because big tech have started to integrate features based on them everywhere, for better or worse). So this is your option (2.). Personally, I prefer software I use NOT to be smart, but to be 100% deterministic. But already my favorite LaTeX authoring environment (Overleaf) has a button pop up called \"fix this\" that auto-resolves syntax errors, many of which overwhelm my doctoral students that no longer read books end-to-end (here, to learn LaTeX). Gradually, you may dive deeper into the \"how\", driven by either need or curiosity, so eventually you will probably have done both (2.) and (1.). - in the same way that you will have first learned SQL before learning how replication, transactions, data buffers and caches, or query optimizers are implemented. reply",

Take databases as example, network stack, etc. Just because a field is popular, doesn't mean you should switch to going deep into it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it - it costs a few dollars to try it out and see whether it fits your workflow. If it does, this is great and you can be more productive and focus on stuff that you can solve and LLM can't, but if it doesn't, that is fine too. reply",

          "text": "I think this type of question is, roughly, backwards. If you start by building a project _for_ some group of people you do it by talking to them, getting requirements, building, demoing, iterating, etc. Promotion, in this model, is a continuous process of community interaction. You're building distribution. To build and _then_ begin promoting, which is how I have historically done it too, is to rely on marketing and advertising spend to define and drive a value prop for a market that is, hopefully, well-defined. You're buying distribution. In that context, the answer in this case is to simply start talking about your project and showing it to people and asking for feedback (as you have done), and be conscious that what you're looking for is signals of user interest -- little sparks that you can convert into tiny flames so that you can start a fire. Assume that you are still at user experience iteration zero. Everything you've done so far is sunk cost and still needs iterative user validation. reply",

          "text": "All good! Let me start by saying that, for me, this is the hardest part of any creative endeavour and I haven't figured it out. I'm mostly writing this to myself. Second, this is a very deep aspect of the tech business, so I'm going to glide across the surface with some main points, but everything I say below is more properly addressed in essay format. I would recommend not thinking of it as \"work\", but as a new, different part of your project. If you want to turn the project into a business, which is the lens I use to approach these things, then it will eventually _become_ work -- but right now it helps if you choose to feel that you're excited to find people who need your help. Generally speaking, you want to get into the heads of a bunch of likely users, or ideally actual users, and then help them do what they're trying to do with your project. You do this by getting lots and lots and lots of user feedback, which necessarily starts with prospective users, and looking for commonalities. You have to keep putting your project in front of people you think might be interested, thinking critically about their feedback, and integrating it. Your previous thread is a great start: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040301 -- you got a lot very compelling feedback here, particularly this part: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048399 1. Consider adding the feature the parent asks for, yes, and consider it STRONGLY. It's from someone who wants to use your project in a particular way that seems really cool. Then, ideally, follow-up with that poster and show that you've done it. Ask them to share it with interested people and see how they react. 2. In that response you say you're thinking of starting a community. DO THIS. It's hard to follow up on HN. You want a place where interested people can follow, and get excited about, your progress. Some creatives use Discord, a newsletter, X, etc. This is close to what people mean when they say \"build in public\". 3. The sub-reply asks for common templates. STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS. \"Presets\" that accomplish common goals quickly are extremely useful. Apple calls them something like \"intelligent defaults\". Mozart used instruments with \"default\" sounds to accomplish his goal: writing operas and symphonies. For JavaFactory (great name) specifically, you want to put it in front of LOTS AND LOTS of Java developers -- and you're lucky: there are millions of them. \"Fish where the fish are\" -- find out where they hang out and go hang out with them. Search for people talking about, off the top of my head, why they wish IntelliJ was more like Cursor or something, and show them what you've done. Talk about what you're doing and ask for feedback. Generally give feedback a higher weight than your own ideas, but filter it against a vision of what you're trying to actually accomplish -- don't just build what people ask for, adjust your project to accomplish their goal and eliminate their complaint. Try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. This is a very strange way for lots of people to think, but you are looking for signal in a lot of noise. You just have to keep looking and refining and showing and demoing and pivoting and adding and subtracting, always in front of an audience, until they start liking what you're doing. Then try to get them to join your community, or newsletter, etc. -- but always, ideally, use the software. THEN Once you know who your typical user is and what value they get from your project, and this should be very specific and well-defined, THEN you find out where THOSE people are and \"fish where the fish are\" again, much more specifically and with a more targeted message. At this point maybe you own the fishing pond (your community, or newsletter, etc.). NOW you can look at ad spend and CAC-to-LTV ratios and growth metrics and VC and things. But all of the above is different for every founder/product/market/etc. You just have to figure it out the hard way. The way capitalism works is you have to provide lots of people something that they need but don't know how to get. This means new things are ALWAYS found in places no one is looking yet. The fact that you're a beginner is a huge advantage because you have the flexibility of approach to try EVERYTHING, which you should do, and find new ways that work. Yes, this is a bit of a grind, but done properly it's really creative and fun. See: https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html reply",

We quickly realized that paid ads are expensive and often ineffective when your audience is broad and not super easy to target. Also paid influencers suck. I am sure there is a right way to do it, but we aren’t full-time marketers, and every time it has been a nightmare working with one. What’s worked better for us is steady organic growth: talking to friends and strangers about it, and just being active wherever we can. Word of mouth and small network effects have been key. It’s not fast, but it’s been surprisingly durable. We’ve been building an event planning app called dateit( https://dateit.com ) similar to Facebook events but better, and most of our growth has come from just optimizing the product to be simple and useful, and constantly refining it based on feedback. If you’re bootstrapping, you really have to lean into creating content and iterating fast. It takes time but it does compound if the product is good. reply",

          "text": "Marketing to developers is tough business.  We are typically highly skeptical of things, and tend to see through promotion efforts.  We are also pretty aware of what our problems are and are (often) quick to decide whether some solution will actually work for us.  We dislike changing our workflows and have a natural resistance to that, even when the \"new way\" may be a little better than what we have.  If it isn't substantially better, we'll often stick with what we know.  Muscle memory mixed with comfort is a beast after all. My general advice is to just speak plainly and frankly about your project on forums where it could be helpful to people.  Don't exaggerate and don't sugar coat as those will be seen through and likely called out.  Be willing to take crticial feedback for what it's worth.  Some people are grumpy assholes, but often you'll get useful data even from them. For example a grumpy but helpful reply to your project might be \"I don't want to adopt this new thing in my workflow and have it go abandoned/unmaintained on me.\"  That's a genuine concern that many people have that you would need to address in order to get them interested. I think HN and Reddit are actually great places to talk about your project.  Also I would look at any Java forums, especially related to AI tooling.  Just be prepared to explain in plain language why your tool is useful in a world with Copilot/Claude/Gemini/etc.  (this is just general advice.  In your post yesterday you did a good job so I don't mean this specifically for this case) reply",

          "text": "I've always been under the impression that if you make something truly useful or interesting, it will spread through word of mouth naturally and quickly. This is how my book The Gospel by Gen Z became a best seller in 2023-2024. I did absolutely no advertising for it. People posted tiktoks about it of their own volition, got dozens of millions of views, and that was the source for 100% of my sales. The same thing is true about my project I posted last night, still at the top of Show HN right now apparently. I spent about 6 months during 3 months time writing code that I personally thought was good and useful and powerful and interesting. When I shared it, it all went terribly wrong. I wrote the article in a rush while I was having a very bad day. I forwent polishing it up before releasing it. And yet it got lots and lots of upvotes for some reason. I suck at advertising and promotion. I honestly really do. And to a large extent I feel like that's a good thing. I've always felt uncomfortable with the traditional route of advertising, which is basically to oversell the potential usefulness of your product, to the point of basically being straight up lying. So I guess my only advice is to just make something you personally believe in, and the rest will follow. reply",

Here’s what worked for me: Start with a solid project page – Focus on making your plugin polished easy to install and use via a project page. Good docs and instructions also drives search to your plugin organically. Create useful content – Blog posts, guides, or even short articles that explain how and why you built the plugin something like behind the scenes. People read this stuff. Use GitHub topics – Tag your repo well. People browse topics and trending pages. This is actually how one of our projects started getting noticed. Submit to awesome lists – there are “awesome” lists related to IntelliJ plugins Java dev tools, AI tools send a PR to add your project. It’s a great way to get visibility among the right audience. Be genuinely helpful in your niche – If your plugin helps with a common pain (e.g. repetitive Java boilerplate), hang out in relevant forums or threads (like here, Reddit, etc.). When you help someone, they’ll often check out your work. See how it all goes and know when to move on, Good luck with your plugin. reply",

          "text": "Realistically, it was probably graduating high school. It's step one in the so-called 'success sequence' for a reason: 1. Finish high school. 2. Get a full-time job once you finish school. 3. Get married before you have children. 97% of millennials who followed that sequence avoided poverty by the time we hit age 30 or so, so it's got a pretty good success rate. #2 has the most immediate impact here, but #1 makes #2 much easier, and not following #3 sadly makes #2 moderately harder (juggling childcare is tough even in the best of circumstances). Finishing college would be a somewhat distant second, as it makes the entry pathway into a lot of white collar jobs a lot easier, even internationally. This was especially important when I realized pretty soon after finishing college that I had good reason to leave the US. I'm now happily married with kids and full time employed in a senior position here in Finland, all by 30, so I'd say I've done pretty well for myself. reply",

          "text": "This [0] comment and discussion under it about how non technical businesses are very rarely run by technical people, and how if you apply your technical skills to such a business it can be a force multiplier. Well, it so happened that my partner had started a small sourdough bakery the year before. I was thinking about investing in it. This comment provided some of the inspiration and now a few years later we're both working on it full time, we have three  cafe branches, one production facility, 25 staff, thinking about opening another branch in a neighboring city. Our skills complement each other - she's great at baking and HR, I'm better at developing business processes, managing the tooling, researching equipment, making sure things are properly documented. We're both crap at marketing, but somehow we get by! My old career as a graphics dev feels like a distant memory, but I do keep my skills sharp and might go back to it in the future. It has by no means been an easy ride for me, I am forced to juggle a ton of jobs and many of them are way outside my comfort zone. But at the same time, I'm creating something in the real world, and providing employment for 25 people, whom I do my best to make sure are treated well and given a decent place to work. This feels far more impactful than my graphics work ever was. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24099409 reply",

The really important computing nowadays is all done on the GPU; the CPU is little more than a front-end processor. Furthermore, with AI and LLMs we're rapidly converging on a future where programming won't even resemble programming as we know it. If you're young and talented, the time to get ahead of the game is NOW. I am no longer young, so I will probably be one of the ones left behind. reply",

If I'm really devoted to feeding the hungry, for instance, I should always remember the proper goal is to end hunger (outright). Even if that goal is unattainable. Maybe because that goal is unattainable.

It has all sorts of people ranging from the experts to beginners. Also, tech is one of the easiest thing to provide proof or refute (Ofcourse subjective debates lik vim vs emacs, formatting, best practices exists for fun). So, the quality of discussions on those topics are high. When HN posts deviate and gets into murky discussions like (geo)politics it gets ugly too. The title may not be \"Trump did X\" but the content on those related issues is not too far from that on other forums. I don't think HN crowd and discussions are immune to the crap found on other forums, it's just the theme and majority of topics that reach front page are resistant and have less scope for ugly discussions. That said, I'm not discounting the effort put in by everyone  and the mods to keep the discussion clean but in the end we are all people and (hopefully) not AI bots and  that shows sometimes. reply",

          "text": "- I was most influenced by HN threads on books. I read dozens of books based on HN recommendations. This tangibly, concretely changed my life in a small way. I found authors like Neal Stephenson, Greg Egan, Hofstadter, etc. from HN. I am forever thankful. Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and it thoroughly changed my life (as one element, not the sole thing). Just search \"ask hn books\", ans you will see ~30/40 threads with high quality recommendations. - MOOCs recommended on HN threads are fantastic. I spent hundreds of hours on MOOCs recommended here. Same goes for textbooks. Other people’s lists I found posted here are also great. Like Mark Saroufim, Susan Rigetti, etc. I now have a really high threshold quality for tech/math books. I read SICP, Little Schemer, Steven Strogatz among many great books. There are threads on tech books, MOOCs, especially those posted during pandemics. - I learned about the fast.ai MOOC here, and projects I did from the MOOC helped me land my first Deep Learning job. I was a Physics undergrad. - There is higher quality of discourse where the standard is high. This put things into perspective, and made me much more confident and capable. Like, just learning a new language in a week- if you think this is normal to most people who do software, you are wrong. - HN posts links to direct judgements, court filings, papers, etc. Now for all areas of my life, I look for the direct source- read new laws, past tax treaties, papers etc. I prefer it over reading blogs or newpaper reports. - HN is actually diverse. I, for the first time in my life, encountered sane Right Wing here on HN. I am from India, and all American social media were biased towards one direction, and the RW discourse was kind of eh, not smart. Maybe Quora had a small faction of smart RW. Having smart RW sources to read and learn from makes me a well-rounded person. English is not my first language, and I jumped into social media without any supervision when I was 13. So, take that into account. All American social media was a particular side's echo-chamber. That was eyebrow raising and squint-demanding from even a 16 yo me. - I see many on HN working with electronics, Math, AI as hobbies/side projects. That has directly inspired me to do the same in my life. - There are a lot of people here who have families, a home, focus on friends, a job/business- helps me striving towards those. Before, there was a distorted view of consumer/hedonism/activism focused adult life focused on money, extremely strong opinions, bragging about achievements, etc. From the outside HN might seem like a startup/money focused forum for a certain \"kind\", but it has the highest concentration of diverse smart people in my experience. No other forum has so many meditators, electronics-tinkerer-for-fun, Math-obsessed-for-fun, etc. I started meditating ~4 years back based on a comment that recommended Mind Illuminated book. HN played an important role in my coming-of-age. Thank you, HN! reply",
