      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I don't know whether it's a common question you have from prospective employers, but if I'm running a business (FWIW, I'm not), I'd be worried that regularly sending money to Iraq might trigger some alarms (anti-money laundering, sanctions, etc.), and this probably trumps any other consideration unless somehow you're able to show that you're so good at doing the work that it's worth the (perceived) risk. So I'm speculating that maybe you'd have better chances if you focus on crypto-friendly companies and figure out a way to receive money using crypto, and mention this upfront or at least at the same time you reveal where you are currently. reply",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3.

It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward.

Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

          "text": "That’s a great question! Basically  all of the religions make truth claims, and these truth claims are contradictory. For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

The Bible is full of contradictions[0]. Also, you write \"Jesus is the son of God\" and next paragraph you write \"Jesus, ie God himself\". Is Jesus his own son? (Fwiw, I attended Catholic schools for 13 years, made many good friends, and still think that religion is nonsense.) > As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Are you saying Catholicism is better because it's older? The Jews would say Judaism is the right one. That Catholicism and all the other Christian denominations were founded much later, and Jesus was just another prophet. [0]: https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/first/contra2_list.ht... reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

Running your own DNS server isnt simple? The standard Microsoft DHCP/DNS process is to take DHCP leases and turn them into DNS entries. Part of the reason a lot of answers are going to challenge your simple requirements, is that theres a great deal of malware that would love to do what you want to do, and these systems are largely hardened to prevent it. If this is for an application you want to deploy, I believe \"Simple\" for userspace, is quite complex to overcome all the things trying to prevent exactly this. My gut feeling is that this desire will evolve into a docker container with a DNS resolver, and just present some kind of interface for adding records.

          "text": "Last year I had the entirety of my left hippocampus and amygdala removed (yes, seriously). And yet I still work in a highly cognitive area of software engineering as a senior engineer. Has my short term memory gone to hell? Wait, what was this post about again? I joke. Many, many years ago when I was in college studying computer science I spent an extraordinary amount of time studying holistic learning techniques to help aid in my exams. The next year I was in a coma. Shortly thereafter, I swung back fighting, making sure the universe knew it didn’t have the upper hand. I won. So there’s several things here. There are people like yourself, battling this kind of thing. Don’t feel like you’re alone. Secondly there are approaches to help improve things, whether it be holistic learning, repetition, or both. And finally, tell the universe to go screw itself, otherwise you’re giving it permission to win. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "Mine has been patchy for a long time, but I've come up with various rationalisations: - Work item priorities changing on a semi-regular basis means that \"working memory\" can need to be purged at the drop of a hat. Happens enough times and you just start, not even necessarily consciously, not committing some things to memory. - Having kids has meant there's always something on \"soon\", so we try to keep all the things in a shared calendar. It's not possible for me to remember all the things, so there's no point remembering some of them, so I don't. The calendar is the singular source of truth. - My wife tends to recount the entirety of her day to me, randomly interspersed with a couple of pieces of information that are critically important to our lives between now and three months from now, as soon as either she or I walk in the door after work. I don't try to remember any of it any more because I just don't, and never did, have the throughput capability. - I've heard that making memories (and this might be specific to long term behavioural type memories, so maybe moot) has a relationship with adrenaline production - you'll remember something scary or exciting or dangerous or unusual. I'm a fairly chill mf, so my assumption is that I don't pump adrenaline quite a easily as most people, and therefore memories are less likely to be \"sticky\" (tenuous reasoning). - Life and work are increasingly busy and complex. Short term memory may be getting saturated by things we don't realise are using short term memory, and so it feels as if short term memory is worse, when actually it's just at capacity all the time. - There is always something else on our minds. If you're thinking about X (which is important to you) and someone else starts explaining Y, then there's a fair period of mental wind down of X in order to start processing Y, during which time they've already kinda got to the middle. An analogy I've used when discussing \"remembering details\" with work colleagues: We're having 50 tennis balls thrown at us all at once. We shouldn't be expected to be catching more than one - and it may not even be the one you were trying to catch. In the case of my wife's rapid fire information delivery, I'm being thrown 50 tennis balls, two of which are invisibly marked as critical, and I'm expected to catch both.

          "text": "I have always had some mindless habits, like putting something down without thinking, and then having to wonder where it is. I just never filed it. Now that I am old as in 76, I find that things which should be instantly retrievable from memory have a 5 second or so lag, and then they are right there. If I try to search the web for a hint (this sometimes triggers recall) but with the current sad state of search, I have to scroll past pages of “this shit’s for sale” if not downright ads instead of something I seek. That just angers me. I find that I can remember things faster than the internet of sh—t. It seems to have (you guessed it, ADHD). When I discussed some of my macro behaviors with my daughter, the psych grad, such as putting off a move decision (because things are stable here though with serous distance and loneliness limitations, compared to the risk and effort of moving) and some other things (that I forgot … ) she said that was textbook ADHD, though on a large scale rather than moment to moment. I’ll look this up. A boring day today, then a double rainbow appeared along with a fine sunset (those fluffy clouds make one) each on the other side of the ridge here, so hiking was involved, and then took a shot at some Rachmaninoff, so I can’t say anything’s duller upstairs. Most of us are infovores, and can’t possibly thoroughly read every article we see. I file stuff as PDF’s for computer search (you know what I think of web search) and later reading. I am OK with this because I don’t actually NEED the vast majority of it, and some gets filed on the desktop because it’s the outlier that really wants me to act on it. It’s the gold in the pan. Scanning through the mass of photos or reading those hundreds (thousands) of musical notes on the page (iPad) really does take attention, and I take breaks. I think I underestimate what goes into touching up photos, and reading so many notes that always seem too small. The only really annoying thing is the delay in recall, but I am expecting instant recall, and that’s a lot for anyone. The summer heat kept me inside too much, and that means staring at screens. Cooler now, so I’ll get outside more, and don’t forget sunshine for vitamin D. And short term? I am slowly downsizing, and there’s just too much lying around to keep track of. The few moments when things are better organized, things are easier to find. And guess who’s posting on Hacker News instead of straightening up the kitchen? Well, that must be attended to. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "Okay. Let's assume your top priority is to test for genetic health issues, I will also assume that you either plan on reducing the risk of future complications or you are factoring this information into account when deciding to get children (otherwise, why would you want this information?). In the first case (reducing risk factors), chances that you will at least check positive for one thing are almost 1 (certain) and you don't need a test to know that. In almost all cases, limiting the risk will involve a) eating well b) stopping alcohol / smoking c) regular physical activity d) taking some Aspirin for the remainder of your life. You don't need the test results to start doing this. Either you sincerely want to live longer and shouldn't wait for genetic screening to take your matters into your own hands, or you think that test results will suddenly turn you into a monk. News flash: won't happen. In the second case (whether or not to procreate): any decision you make on the hypothesis that your children will inherit it and that science will not have solved it in the next 50 years will very likely be a bad reason to not have children (there are many good reasons to not have children, though, but having a rare genetic conditions is not a good reason). The only people who should not have kids are bad parents and people who don't want kids. Guess what? These two groups that probably have the highest amount of kids on Earth. reply",

But for genetics like that simply looking at your own previous generations would give you the answer there. (And of course, that assumes you have access to that, which clearly not everyone does.) Having children is obviously a big responsibility, and every parent wants only the best for them. Doing genetic testing can at least feel like you've done your due diligence. I would point out though that genetic diseases are a tiny tiny fraction of the things that can go wrong. The overwhelming majority of children turn out fine. But some don't. That's life I'm afraid. Genetic testing isn't a guarantee they'll be OK. I'd go so far as to suggest it's basically meaningless in that context (especially if you have access to parents, grandparents etc.) However you progress, I wish you well. reply",

Using DIY tools and not being a trained biostatistician or whoever usually looks at these things you are very likely to face errors you don't know how to account for.  I would guess the odds are high you'll encounter scary false positives for example. It sounds really fun though, something I've always wanted to do with more time. reply",

In other words, I am looking for a non-malicious keylogger that could auto-split the stream of keystrokes on ENTER keycode, and/or user-adjustable timeout, and would present a list of snippets by pressing a special shortcut. From there, a simple double-click on the item would copy it to clipboard.<p>So, a typed text history tool of sorts.<p>A keyboard recall tool.<p>A hybrid between clipboard recall and a keylogger.<p>Was searching on Github, couldn't find any.<p>Any hints would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And implemented their own understanding of the problem domain. These days, if you're super unlucky, you discover that your frontend has been blessed with some non-standard component wrappers, which wrap components, which wrap components, which wrap...

          "text": "They never left. But SPA is now more in demand than the old school server-side rendering where you return HTML in your response and let the web browser render it as is. Decoupling back-end logic from front-end logic has just too much positivise and advantages that doing SSR is just so 2000s. JS brought dynamicity into web page rendering a long time ago. With SPA, or maybe even PWA(who really uses these?), you get also decoupling from the server - a data dynamicity, so to speak. In short, SPA turns a dumb web page into a dynamic and responsive application that can have the look and feel of a desktop program. Web is no longer static and slow but fast and lively. Nowadays, static HTML is a niche use case for serving web pages. Like a personal blog or corporate website that is static in nature(information there change sparsely) and can be manually typed or compiled via static website builder, like Hugo. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

          "text": "Non tech, but I started a sports beverage company with my brother and a neighbor.  We are based in South Florida. My brother and I grew up playing sports and remember the simplicity of home-made drinks we'd take to games that blew the likes of Gatorade out of the park.  We aim to replicate the simplicity of home-made drinks with simple ingredients. https://www.drinkiso.com/ Our whole value-add is based around the fact that most sports drinks or hydration drinks contain a lot of junk.  We are opposed to the bullshit catch-all that is \"natural flavors\" and believe in product transparency and honesty. Our products straddle the line between fresh-pressed juice and sports drinks.  Our prices are definitely on the higher end, but with scale, we can lower them. We currently are in growth mode - and currently are one of the best selling products in the top boutique gym chain in the Miami area, as well as going strong in all SoFLA Equinox locations (except for the WPB location which isn't open yet). We do sell online but shipping is a PITA as overnight shipping costs for cold products are astronomical.  When we find a cheaper solution so I can ship around the country, I'll let everyone here know :) Based in South Florida (Miami-Dade, FtL, West Palm)?   DM me and let's meet up! reply",

          "text": "In 2023 a friend and I started a monthly dinner club with the goal of eating around the world without getting on a plane. We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics/circuits: https://circuitscript.net/ Recently, I have released a simple IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ The next steps are to create more schematics with Circuitscript as examples to test the limitations of the language and to generate PCB designs with KiCAD. The Circuitscript tool (currently only the desktop cli tool) is able to generate KiCAD netlists and this can be imported into PCBnew. The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "You can actually skip all the wire commands and still generate a valid netlist, however the schematic might be a bit hard to decipher if there are many components! I did explore automated layout algorithms for components in the schematics, however the readability and flow of the schematics might not be ideal, depending on what the algorithm prioritizes. In the end, I realized that the actual layout and arrangement of the schematic itself was critical in the overall understanding. That was when I decided to add the \"wire\" command and give more control back to the schematic designer. In the future, I do plan to add some automated way to generate these \"wire\" commands for automated layout. If the designer ever chooses to edit this automated schematic layout, he would be able to edit the wire commands for finer control. In the end, I do believe that the visual part of the schematic plays an important role in understanding it. I, too, have spent hours puzzling/being misled by poorly drawn/disorganized schematics. Especially during troubleshooting or creating an updated revision, having a good understanding of the schematic saves time. One of the aims of Circuitscript is to make the visual part easier, so at least more time can be spent thinking and organizing the schematic itself. reply",

About to roll out the beta. Hoping to have a full release by the end of the year. It’s my first iOS app in 8 years! Learning SwiftUI after UIKit has been quite the shift. reply",

Day of month across the top, all the things I'm supposed to do along the side. Something to share and discuss with my care providers. Mine's just a spreadsheet that I tweak and print every month. (Then added to my discbound clipboard organizer, that I bring everywhere.) I haven't had the gumption to digitize my effort. I really like the physical check lists. Though I've wondered how a hybrid solution might work. eg vital signs added automatically to digital version via Health.app. eg scan printed copy and magically fill in the digital version.

Solid Queue handles scheduled jobs like weekly tuition and late fee automation so owners get predictable cash flow without hand-cranking invoices, while MailerSend keeps parents in the loop. Right now I’m polishing the onboarding flow so new centers can import families, configure their billing cadence, and connect Stripe in under ten minutes. Next up is richer analytics (occupancy tracking and revenue health) and rolling out a guided setup for late fee policies.

Interior visualisation (basically 3D renders) which largely target the what-if amateur market 2. Big, clunky and old software tools for professional interior designers working on huge projects, which works well but has that universal sort of mild dislike to strong disdain depending on the person 3. New players who want to replace the old clunky software Seeing this, we decided not to try to overthrow the old all-powerful project management solution, but rather to replace a single process in the interior design workflow.

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I have no idea of your living conditions so honest feedback beyond that is quite hard. Different places are different man. I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

Making a product is not trivial - it's double hard. First you need to come up with a product.

There are success stories, sure, but so many people in the internet are hustling so success looks like driven by chance rather than a deterministic outcome by following a given process.

You did mention you liked programming, but was that triggered by the glamor and promise? 2. Assuming that it is still to do with computers. A software business does not have to be about building products and selling them. I imagine in Iraq (or where ever you are) there are many small businesses and non-technical people who need their computers maintained and repaired (example, this guy has posted on HN and has a small business that does this : https://www.scottrlarson.com/services/computer/repair/ .. I am not affiliated in any way with him). You might need to hit the street, ignore the fear / embarrassment / rejection, and cold call or cold visit businesses. If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3. Teaching positions may not pay well but may pay the bills while you work to build a career or business. You country was devastated by an illegal war. Rebuilding will take a lot of time and courage.

Your particular combination will be rare, this is where you are most likely to be able to find and solve problems. Since you’re a programmer you are very well suited for that type of analysis.

Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up.

          "text": "That’s a great question! Basically  all of the religions make truth claims, and these truth claims are contradictory. For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward.

          "text": "There was a time I was thinking in similar vibes, but came to realization this is actually oversimplification. 1. if there are jobs offering high pay, and there are people who get them- these jobs are not overpaid, clearly some people want to pay high and there are other people who deliver (and of course there are other who fake it, but it's not a norm) 2. not all people are equal, and not all jobs are equal, and just because 'it feels unfair' does not mean it is unfair. Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

It would be incredibly bad practice but I dont get the impression that this is a concern. >Running a resolver locally, or within the LAN, falls outside the realm of \"simple\". Running your own DNS server isnt simple? The standard Microsoft DHCP/DNS process is to take DHCP leases and turn them into DNS entries. Part of the reason a lot of answers are going to challenge your simple requirements, is that theres a great deal of malware that would love to do what you want to do, and these systems are largely hardened to prevent it. If this is for an application you want to deploy, I believe \"Simple\" for userspace, is quite complex to overcome all the things trying to prevent exactly this. My gut feeling is that this desire will evolve into a docker container with a DNS resolver, and just present some kind of interface for adding records. Then just pipe all your DNS requests through the container. reply",
