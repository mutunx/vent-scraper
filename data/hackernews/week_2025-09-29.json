      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I don't know whether it's a common question you have from prospective employers, but if I'm running a business (FWIW, I'm not), I'd be worried that regularly sending money to Iraq might trigger some alarms (anti-money laundering, sanctions, etc.), and this probably trumps any other consideration unless somehow you're able to show that you're so good at doing the work that it's worth the (perceived) risk. So I'm speculating that maybe you'd have better chances if you focus on crypto-friendly companies and figure out a way to receive money using crypto, and mention this upfront or at least at the same time you reveal where you are currently. reply",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3.

It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward.

Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

          "text": "That’s a great question! Basically  all of the religions make truth claims, and these truth claims are contradictory. For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

The Bible is full of contradictions[0]. Also, you write \"Jesus is the son of God\" and next paragraph you write \"Jesus, ie God himself\". Is Jesus his own son? (Fwiw, I attended Catholic schools for 13 years, made many good friends, and still think that religion is nonsense.) > As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Are you saying Catholicism is better because it's older? The Jews would say Judaism is the right one. That Catholicism and all the other Christian denominations were founded much later, and Jesus was just another prophet. [0]: https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/first/contra2_list.ht... reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

Running your own DNS server isnt simple? The standard Microsoft DHCP/DNS process is to take DHCP leases and turn them into DNS entries. Part of the reason a lot of answers are going to challenge your simple requirements, is that theres a great deal of malware that would love to do what you want to do, and these systems are largely hardened to prevent it. If this is for an application you want to deploy, I believe \"Simple\" for userspace, is quite complex to overcome all the things trying to prevent exactly this. My gut feeling is that this desire will evolve into a docker container with a DNS resolver, and just present some kind of interface for adding records.

          "text": "Last year I had the entirety of my left hippocampus and amygdala removed (yes, seriously). And yet I still work in a highly cognitive area of software engineering as a senior engineer. Has my short term memory gone to hell? Wait, what was this post about again? I joke. Many, many years ago when I was in college studying computer science I spent an extraordinary amount of time studying holistic learning techniques to help aid in my exams. The next year I was in a coma. Shortly thereafter, I swung back fighting, making sure the universe knew it didn’t have the upper hand. I won. So there’s several things here. There are people like yourself, battling this kind of thing. Don’t feel like you’re alone. Secondly there are approaches to help improve things, whether it be holistic learning, repetition, or both. And finally, tell the universe to go screw itself, otherwise you’re giving it permission to win. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "Mine has been patchy for a long time, but I've come up with various rationalisations: - Work item priorities changing on a semi-regular basis means that \"working memory\" can need to be purged at the drop of a hat. Happens enough times and you just start, not even necessarily consciously, not committing some things to memory. - Having kids has meant there's always something on \"soon\", so we try to keep all the things in a shared calendar. It's not possible for me to remember all the things, so there's no point remembering some of them, so I don't. The calendar is the singular source of truth. - My wife tends to recount the entirety of her day to me, randomly interspersed with a couple of pieces of information that are critically important to our lives between now and three months from now, as soon as either she or I walk in the door after work. I don't try to remember any of it any more because I just don't, and never did, have the throughput capability. - I've heard that making memories (and this might be specific to long term behavioural type memories, so maybe moot) has a relationship with adrenaline production - you'll remember something scary or exciting or dangerous or unusual. I'm a fairly chill mf, so my assumption is that I don't pump adrenaline quite a easily as most people, and therefore memories are less likely to be \"sticky\" (tenuous reasoning). - Life and work are increasingly busy and complex. Short term memory may be getting saturated by things we don't realise are using short term memory, and so it feels as if short term memory is worse, when actually it's just at capacity all the time. - There is always something else on our minds. If you're thinking about X (which is important to you) and someone else starts explaining Y, then there's a fair period of mental wind down of X in order to start processing Y, during which time they've already kinda got to the middle. An analogy I've used when discussing \"remembering details\" with work colleagues: We're having 50 tennis balls thrown at us all at once. We shouldn't be expected to be catching more than one - and it may not even be the one you were trying to catch. In the case of my wife's rapid fire information delivery, I'm being thrown 50 tennis balls, two of which are invisibly marked as critical, and I'm expected to catch both.

          "text": "I have always had some mindless habits, like putting something down without thinking, and then having to wonder where it is. I just never filed it. Now that I am old as in 76, I find that things which should be instantly retrievable from memory have a 5 second or so lag, and then they are right there. If I try to search the web for a hint (this sometimes triggers recall) but with the current sad state of search, I have to scroll past pages of “this shit’s for sale” if not downright ads instead of something I seek. That just angers me. I find that I can remember things faster than the internet of sh—t. It seems to have (you guessed it, ADHD). When I discussed some of my macro behaviors with my daughter, the psych grad, such as putting off a move decision (because things are stable here though with serous distance and loneliness limitations, compared to the risk and effort of moving) and some other things (that I forgot … ) she said that was textbook ADHD, though on a large scale rather than moment to moment. I’ll look this up. A boring day today, then a double rainbow appeared along with a fine sunset (those fluffy clouds make one) each on the other side of the ridge here, so hiking was involved, and then took a shot at some Rachmaninoff, so I can’t say anything’s duller upstairs. Most of us are infovores, and can’t possibly thoroughly read every article we see. I file stuff as PDF’s for computer search (you know what I think of web search) and later reading. I am OK with this because I don’t actually NEED the vast majority of it, and some gets filed on the desktop because it’s the outlier that really wants me to act on it. It’s the gold in the pan. Scanning through the mass of photos or reading those hundreds (thousands) of musical notes on the page (iPad) really does take attention, and I take breaks. I think I underestimate what goes into touching up photos, and reading so many notes that always seem too small. The only really annoying thing is the delay in recall, but I am expecting instant recall, and that’s a lot for anyone. The summer heat kept me inside too much, and that means staring at screens. Cooler now, so I’ll get outside more, and don’t forget sunshine for vitamin D. And short term? I am slowly downsizing, and there’s just too much lying around to keep track of. The few moments when things are better organized, things are easier to find. And guess who’s posting on Hacker News instead of straightening up the kitchen? Well, that must be attended to. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "Okay. Let's assume your top priority is to test for genetic health issues, I will also assume that you either plan on reducing the risk of future complications or you are factoring this information into account when deciding to get children (otherwise, why would you want this information?). In the first case (reducing risk factors), chances that you will at least check positive for one thing are almost 1 (certain) and you don't need a test to know that. In almost all cases, limiting the risk will involve a) eating well b) stopping alcohol / smoking c) regular physical activity d) taking some Aspirin for the remainder of your life. You don't need the test results to start doing this. Either you sincerely want to live longer and shouldn't wait for genetic screening to take your matters into your own hands, or you think that test results will suddenly turn you into a monk. News flash: won't happen. In the second case (whether or not to procreate): any decision you make on the hypothesis that your children will inherit it and that science will not have solved it in the next 50 years will very likely be a bad reason to not have children (there are many good reasons to not have children, though, but having a rare genetic conditions is not a good reason). The only people who should not have kids are bad parents and people who don't want kids. Guess what? These two groups that probably have the highest amount of kids on Earth. reply",

But for genetics like that simply looking at your own previous generations would give you the answer there. (And of course, that assumes you have access to that, which clearly not everyone does.) Having children is obviously a big responsibility, and every parent wants only the best for them. Doing genetic testing can at least feel like you've done your due diligence. I would point out though that genetic diseases are a tiny tiny fraction of the things that can go wrong. The overwhelming majority of children turn out fine. But some don't. That's life I'm afraid. Genetic testing isn't a guarantee they'll be OK. I'd go so far as to suggest it's basically meaningless in that context (especially if you have access to parents, grandparents etc.) However you progress, I wish you well. reply",

Using DIY tools and not being a trained biostatistician or whoever usually looks at these things you are very likely to face errors you don't know how to account for.  I would guess the odds are high you'll encounter scary false positives for example. It sounds really fun though, something I've always wanted to do with more time. reply",

In other words, I am looking for a non-malicious keylogger that could auto-split the stream of keystrokes on ENTER keycode, and/or user-adjustable timeout, and would present a list of snippets by pressing a special shortcut. From there, a simple double-click on the item would copy it to clipboard.<p>So, a typed text history tool of sorts.<p>A keyboard recall tool.<p>A hybrid between clipboard recall and a keylogger.<p>Was searching on Github, couldn't find any.<p>Any hints would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And implemented their own understanding of the problem domain. These days, if you're super unlucky, you discover that your frontend has been blessed with some non-standard component wrappers, which wrap components, which wrap components, which wrap...

          "text": "They never left. But SPA is now more in demand than the old school server-side rendering where you return HTML in your response and let the web browser render it as is. Decoupling back-end logic from front-end logic has just too much positivise and advantages that doing SSR is just so 2000s. JS brought dynamicity into web page rendering a long time ago. With SPA, or maybe even PWA(who really uses these?), you get also decoupling from the server - a data dynamicity, so to speak. In short, SPA turns a dumb web page into a dynamic and responsive application that can have the look and feel of a desktop program. Web is no longer static and slow but fast and lively. Nowadays, static HTML is a niche use case for serving web pages. Like a personal blog or corporate website that is static in nature(information there change sparsely) and can be manually typed or compiled via static website builder, like Hugo. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

          "text": "Non tech, but I started a sports beverage company with my brother and a neighbor.  We are based in South Florida. My brother and I grew up playing sports and remember the simplicity of home-made drinks we'd take to games that blew the likes of Gatorade out of the park.  We aim to replicate the simplicity of home-made drinks with simple ingredients. https://www.drinkiso.com/ Our whole value-add is based around the fact that most sports drinks or hydration drinks contain a lot of junk.  We are opposed to the bullshit catch-all that is \"natural flavors\" and believe in product transparency and honesty. Our products straddle the line between fresh-pressed juice and sports drinks.  Our prices are definitely on the higher end, but with scale, we can lower them. We currently are in growth mode - and currently are one of the best selling products in the top boutique gym chain in the Miami area, as well as going strong in all SoFLA Equinox locations (except for the WPB location which isn't open yet). We do sell online but shipping is a PITA as overnight shipping costs for cold products are astronomical.  When we find a cheaper solution so I can ship around the country, I'll let everyone here know :) Based in South Florida (Miami-Dade, FtL, West Palm)?   DM me and let's meet up! reply",

          "text": "In 2023 a friend and I started a monthly dinner club with the goal of eating around the world without getting on a plane. We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics/circuits: https://circuitscript.net/ Recently, I have released a simple IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ The next steps are to create more schematics with Circuitscript as examples to test the limitations of the language and to generate PCB designs with KiCAD. The Circuitscript tool (currently only the desktop cli tool) is able to generate KiCAD netlists and this can be imported into PCBnew. The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

          "text": "You can actually skip all the wire commands and still generate a valid netlist, however the schematic might be a bit hard to decipher if there are many components! I did explore automated layout algorithms for components in the schematics, however the readability and flow of the schematics might not be ideal, depending on what the algorithm prioritizes. In the end, I realized that the actual layout and arrangement of the schematic itself was critical in the overall understanding. That was when I decided to add the \"wire\" command and give more control back to the schematic designer. In the future, I do plan to add some automated way to generate these \"wire\" commands for automated layout. If the designer ever chooses to edit this automated schematic layout, he would be able to edit the wire commands for finer control. In the end, I do believe that the visual part of the schematic plays an important role in understanding it. I, too, have spent hours puzzling/being misled by poorly drawn/disorganized schematics. Especially during troubleshooting or creating an updated revision, having a good understanding of the schematic saves time. One of the aims of Circuitscript is to make the visual part easier, so at least more time can be spent thinking and organizing the schematic itself. reply",

About to roll out the beta. Hoping to have a full release by the end of the year. It’s my first iOS app in 8 years! Learning SwiftUI after UIKit has been quite the shift. reply",

Day of month across the top, all the things I'm supposed to do along the side. Something to share and discuss with my care providers. Mine's just a spreadsheet that I tweak and print every month. (Then added to my discbound clipboard organizer, that I bring everywhere.) I haven't had the gumption to digitize my effort. I really like the physical check lists. Though I've wondered how a hybrid solution might work. eg vital signs added automatically to digital version via Health.app. eg scan printed copy and magically fill in the digital version.

Solid Queue handles scheduled jobs like weekly tuition and late fee automation so owners get predictable cash flow without hand-cranking invoices, while MailerSend keeps parents in the loop. Right now I’m polishing the onboarding flow so new centers can import families, configure their billing cadence, and connect Stripe in under ten minutes. Next up is richer analytics (occupancy tracking and revenue health) and rolling out a guided setup for late fee policies.

Interior visualisation (basically 3D renders) which largely target the what-if amateur market 2. Big, clunky and old software tools for professional interior designers working on huge projects, which works well but has that universal sort of mild dislike to strong disdain depending on the person 3. New players who want to replace the old clunky software Seeing this, we decided not to try to overthrow the old all-powerful project management solution, but rather to replace a single process in the interior design workflow.

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I have no idea of your living conditions so honest feedback beyond that is quite hard. Different places are different man. I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

Making a product is not trivial - it's double hard. First you need to come up with a product.

There are success stories, sure, but so many people in the internet are hustling so success looks like driven by chance rather than a deterministic outcome by following a given process.

You did mention you liked programming, but was that triggered by the glamor and promise? 2. Assuming that it is still to do with computers. A software business does not have to be about building products and selling them. I imagine in Iraq (or where ever you are) there are many small businesses and non-technical people who need their computers maintained and repaired (example, this guy has posted on HN and has a small business that does this : https://www.scottrlarson.com/services/computer/repair/ .. I am not affiliated in any way with him). You might need to hit the street, ignore the fear / embarrassment / rejection, and cold call or cold visit businesses. If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3. Teaching positions may not pay well but may pay the bills while you work to build a career or business. You country was devastated by an illegal war. Rebuilding will take a lot of time and courage.

Your particular combination will be rare, this is where you are most likely to be able to find and solve problems. Since you’re a programmer you are very well suited for that type of analysis.

Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up.

          "text": "That’s a great question! Basically  all of the religions make truth claims, and these truth claims are contradictory. For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward.

          "text": "There was a time I was thinking in similar vibes, but came to realization this is actually oversimplification. 1. if there are jobs offering high pay, and there are people who get them- these jobs are not overpaid, clearly some people want to pay high and there are other people who deliver (and of course there are other who fake it, but it's not a norm) 2. not all people are equal, and not all jobs are equal, and just because 'it feels unfair' does not mean it is unfair. Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

It would be incredibly bad practice but I dont get the impression that this is a concern. >Running a resolver locally, or within the LAN, falls outside the realm of \"simple\". Running your own DNS server isnt simple? The standard Microsoft DHCP/DNS process is to take DHCP leases and turn them into DNS entries. Part of the reason a lot of answers are going to challenge your simple requirements, is that theres a great deal of malware that would love to do what you want to do, and these systems are largely hardened to prevent it. If this is for an application you want to deploy, I believe \"Simple\" for userspace, is quite complex to overcome all the things trying to prevent exactly this. My gut feeling is that this desire will evolve into a docker container with a DNS resolver, and just present some kind of interface for adding records. Then just pipe all your DNS requests through the container. reply",

Most supply chains are still stuck with Excel or enterprise tools that take months (and $MM) to adopt. Our mission is to lower that barrier — making it possible for any business, big or small, to access modern forecasting, inventory, and planning solutions in days, not months. We’re on our journey to democratizing supply chain technology. As our first engineer, you’ll be working with the founders (former Supply chain/tech directors at Amazon who have built key components of Amazon's supply chain) to develop the core product from the grounds up (involves application of LLMs, deep learning, and optimization). If you have mid to senior level experience in software development, have built SaaS applications, understand ML-Engineering, and love building 0->1 products, we would love to talk to you.

WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. We’re hiring on the backend to help solve one of the hardest problems in data engineering: building a production knowledge graph from millions of fragmented, inconsistent Chinese corporate records where traditional approaches break down. Our PySpark/EMR/Airflow pipeline is just the foundation.  The real challenges are in entity resolution across transliterated names and obfuscated ownership structures, bipartite matching algorithms and inferring relationships. We build our product on top of that with a Django/FastAPI/React stack to help our users access that knowledge graph to analyze and investigate any risks they should be aware of. If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you. Apply here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/wirescreen/158fd72f-fc2f-47a3-bdb5-...

          "text": "If all you do is write, you are missing half the benefits of journalling. The key to journalling is to write, and then periodically review what you have written. The most effective way is to create a system for this periodicity. For your daily entries, start by writing down a bulleted list of all the notable things you can remember happening that day. Then write about whatever you want - it can be a stream of consciousness, thoughts on the various events you just wrote down or it can be simply \"nothing of note\" if it was a boring day. At the end of the week, create a weekly note with a heading for each day that has passed e.g 2025-01-01, 2025-01-02, 2025-01-03 etc and write down any thoughts or observations you have as you go back and read that day's entry. Then at the bottom of the page create the following headings: ### Summary of the week ### + (Positives) ### - (Negatives) ### * (Things to improve) ### ? (Open Questions) ### → (Most Important Tasks for next week) ### ! (The single most important task to focus on) ### 3 Things You're Grateful For ### . (Final thoughts) Repeat this each week. Look back at the previous weekly entry and see if you now have the answers to resolve the open questions from before. If not, carry them over. When you get to the end of the month, create a monthly note. For this note, write headings for each of the weeks that has passed e.g Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4. Now do the same again, reading through your weekly notes and writing down any observations you have, patterns you've observed etc in the weekly notes. Finish off with the same list of headings mentioned above, but now thinking on a monthly timeline rather than a weekly one. When you are reflecting think, of how your progress is fitting in to medium term picture of the projects and goals you are working on. Repeat this each month. After three months, create a quarterly note. As you have probably guessed, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 and the headings above. As you are now at the three monthly review, you should now be reflecting and thinking on the larger term picture of how this quarter is fitting into your 1 - 3 year goals. After a year, create a yearly note. Repeat the process with the quarterly notes, but also read and review anything else from the year that you want to reflect on. Think about how the year went and how it fits with your values and the type of life you want for yourself. One caveat on the above: if you are going through a frustrating period where nothing is working out despite all your best efforts, sometimes an incessant feedback loop can just make things worse. If that is the case, you may want to stop journalling for a bit, focus on relaxing and enjoying life and come back to it when the storm has passed. reply",

So in my big Org file there is everything worth referencing again, and in the morning I’ll take a wide overview of it, coming back to a few particular items like long-term goals or how the year has been, and that’s the starting point for the thoughts that I then jot down. Staring at a blank file every morning isn’t interesting to me, but adding a little chunk of thought casually to my second brain is rewarding in itself. I’m an Org Mode evangelist. I didn’t get it at first but now I don’t think I could get rid of it. I’ll probably be editing this file until my final days! reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

          "text": "I’m working on an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

          "text": "Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics/circuits: https://circuitscript.net/ Recently, I have released a simple IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/ The next steps are to create more schematics with Circuitscript as examples to test the limitations of the language and to generate PCB designs with KiCAD. The Circuitscript tool (currently only the desktop cli tool) is able to generate KiCAD netlists and this can be imported into PCBnew. The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs. The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse. Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks! reply",

I did explore automated layout algorithms for components in the schematics, however the readability and flow of the schematics might not be ideal, depending on what the algorithm prioritizes. In the end, I realized that the actual layout and arrangement of the schematic itself was critical in the overall understanding. That was when I decided to add the \"wire\" command and give more control back to the schematic designer. In the future, I do plan to add some automated way to generate these \"wire\" commands for automated layout. If the designer ever chooses to edit this automated schematic layout, he would be able to edit the wire commands for finer control. In the end, I do believe that the visual part of the schematic plays an important role in understanding it. I, too, have spent hours puzzling/being misled by poorly drawn/disorganized schematics. Especially during troubleshooting or creating an updated revision, having a good understanding of the schematic saves time. One of the aims of Circuitscript is to make the visual part easier, so at least more time can be spent thinking and organizing the schematic itself. reply",

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I have no idea of your living conditions so honest feedback beyond that is quite hard. Different places are different man. I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

          "text": "\"you can simply sell a product.\" Are you personally making a living by selling a product or service you created - and if so could you share something of your experience? Making a product is not trivial - it's double hard. First you need to come up with a product. Then you need to sell it and the latter is possibly much harder than the technology in all except the most complex of products. There are success stories, sure, but so many people in the internet are hustling so success looks like driven by chance rather than a deterministic outcome by following a given process. (If you get to medical school, then becoming a doctor is a deterministic outcome. If you get unemployed, coming up with a product and sales to make a living does not seem deterministic to me in the same sense). reply",

I imagine in Iraq (or where ever you are) there are many small businesses and non-technical people who need their computers maintained and repaired (example, this guy has posted on HN and has a small business that does this : https://www.scottrlarson.com/services/computer/repair/ .. I am not affiliated in any way with him). You might need to hit the street, ignore the fear / embarrassment / rejection, and cold call or cold visit businesses. If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3.

Once you decide on the job you what to get then define a plan that outlines how to get the job you want. Part of that plan might mean getting any job you qualify for even if it's not what you want right now. Once you get your foot in the door then you can work towards getting promoted or transferred to the department where you want to work. Also, join any organization where you might get contacts that will help your career. A vast majority of jobs are found by who you know not what you know.

The software is just a tool, and software engineering is a framework to apply those tools in practice.

The local issue you have is with a career goal that has not panned out, do you hold on to the dream or do you ‘face reality’ as people in your life and here would urge you to do. What adversity does is challenge our attachment profile. This helps the timid hoarder, who wants to keep everything, by forcing them to choose. They learn a stronger, purer, sense of self in the process. A lesson we can’t seem to learn as fast, voluntarily. Victor Frankl describes it in great detail as a holocaust survivor in Man’s Search For Meaning. So embrace your hardship. Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up. But for the rest, maybe introduce flexibility, experiment more. You have an opinion on these other opportunities not being worth it, but what have you tried? You see things up close that the ruminating knee hugger simply won’t ever see by thought alone. reply",

For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later.

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith.

This is just your opinion: I'm sure Jesus was a remarkable character, but I don't see how it's clear that he was god. From my point of view he was just a normal person and didn't have the authority to start a valid religion. > The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years Respectfully disagree with both. The smartest people I know have figured out it's nonsense. > And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Here I think I can agree with you that the church is an antidote to 99% of the problems modern people are suffering from. Though I think there are other ways too.

The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward. EDIT: I didn't realize that our guy here is in Iraq. With that said I will leave the original post so a bunch of overpaid software developers can tell me how misguided and angsty I am. reply",

          "text": "There was a time I was thinking in similar vibes, but came to realization this is actually oversimplification. 1. if there are jobs offering high pay, and there are people who get them- these jobs are not overpaid, clearly some people want to pay high and there are other people who deliver (and of course there are other who fake it, but it's not a norm) 2. not all people are equal, and not all jobs are equal, and just because 'it feels unfair' does not mean it is unfair. Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

When I dive into a new project with an unfamiliar codebase, I analyze it by putting pieces of code directly into a mind map as nodes. Is anyone else here doing the same?<p>I used to copy and paste code into a separate mind-mapping app, but I eventually developed a Visual Studio / VS Code extension to do this natively. It lets you jump to the linked code with a click on the node. This feature was a game changer in code navigation for me.

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and are already rolling out across some of the largest care chains across Europe, including most of the NHS. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We’re especially keen to talk to Staff Engineers (backend) and Senior AI Engineers (e.g. LLMs and the scaffolding around, computer-use agents) Even if we don’t have a role out  your specific skill set, we’d love to talk!

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want. We're getting big enough to start splitting into more focused teams and there's a few different areas that we need; our infra needs a lot of work, we have big dreams for some cool AI agent/pipeline work and there's still a lot of more fundamental phone system specific problems we need to solve. We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!

By doing so, we create path-dependence, which enables us to specify system-level goals for agents to solve for. Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal/regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities. We're venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market and are hiring for roles spanning product engineers, CRDT wizards, and compiler/calculation engine leads.

I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only. With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

I'm Mike. I'm a polyglot backend computer/software engineer w 20+ years experience delivering software in high-stakes, high-paced roles. I have spent the majority of my career in remote roles around the finance, cryptocurrency, and IoT industries. I pickup new ideas quickly, self-start, and self-direct. I don't know how to idle. I enjoy making sense of chaos and and turning ambiguity into understood risk with insight toward mitigation. I have prototyped my share of MVPs and understand how to glean value from tight feedback loops. I offer technical leadership that understands how to drive consensus toward pragmatic solutions in teams of all sizes. I deliver at a level which most companies consider a Staff/Senior Engineer. I'm looking for opportunities where I can leverage my deep Golang experience into opportunities to learn new languages/technology. New interesting technology includes (but not limited to) Zig, AI/ML, applied cryptography, and creating unique experiences through art/music.

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip - Community engagement platform for soccer fans. Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it! reply",

You can also visit github.com/<hnusername>.) I'm not actively looking (hence why my resume link is obfuscated like that) but I'm at least interested in getting a feel for the market right now. That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line! reply",

Career highlights: invented Time.gov at NIST, created SpicyNodes visualization platform (315K creators, 40M users), pioneered semantic wordplay games. After 25 years of architecting systems and leading teams up to 40 people, I also ship production code with AI tools.

I love the web, technology, and video games. I also serve as the creator and core maintainer for Skeleton ( https://www.skeleton.dev/ ), an open source design system and component library currently available for Svelte and React (with Vue and Solid.js coming soon). I've grown the project from a small internal toolkit for a 5 person startup to a fully featured standalone library. We average around 80k downloads a month, have nearly 6k stars on GitHub, and community of over 2k members on Discord. I recently traveled to Barcelona Spain for the Svelte Summit where I had the privilege to meet many of my peers in the Svelte and greater open source community - including Rich Harris (creator of Svelte), who praised our work on Skeleton. I would love to work on FOSS all day every day, but in order to support myself I split my time and operate as a freelancer alongside my open source contributions. This means I'm currently available around 20-30 hours a week Monday-Friday. I'm open to any sort of interesting project with a focus on frontend web. I'm also available to act in a consultant role. I'm ideally seeking projects that make a positive contribution to society. Thanks for your consideration! reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking. On the service-side, I’ve worked with traditional service hosting, containers, and serverless, including (but not limited to) AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Workers, CloudFormation, SAM CLI, nodejs, bunjs, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, grpc, Redis, Docker, nginx, and a few legacy tools best left unnamed (yes, including CodeIgniter and ftp). I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

While my core competency is frontend and the React ecosystem, I can navigate the full stack confidently and contribute to most any codebase.  I've worked on products sitting atop PHP, C#/.NET, Python, Rails and Node. The bulk of my experience is in startups (B2C, B2B & SaaS), though I am open to any organization that provides a strong culture fit.  In my experience, culture and team dynamics far outways what is being built - or the tech that is being used.  I am growth oriented and passionate about working collaboratively, cross-functionally, and making a meaningful impact in people's lives with what is built. I'm also unafraid of legacy code or tech debt. Note: My current role and location is in St Thomas, USVI.  After my last startup role, my family and I decided to try something new and see if life in the Virgin Islands could work for us.  In short, it did not.  My family is already in WA, and I am here finishing up my role as IT Coordinator.  I will be joining my family in WA at the end of November. reply",

I'm Dhani, and I've been in the tech space for the past 14 years or so (aka since I graduated). I started off building VB.NET automations around Excel and SQL server as well helping revive a left-for-dead DWH project for a bank, before venturing into telco (where I built reporting and online self-assessment platforms), consulting (implementing K2 BPA for an assortment of local companies and MNCs), e-commerce (gamification, reporting) and fintech. Fintech also happened to be the part where I took a somewhat sharp turn in my career and delved into the infra/devops/SRE side of things; which exposed me to contanerization and orchestration, and eventually later towards Kubernetes. As of now, I'm in a probationary status in a local fintech/crypto exchange, juggling between helping engineers and being a devops ticket monkey -- setting up Jenkins pipelines, GCP resources, the works. I enjoy doing R&D stuff as well as writing automations -- in a previous job posting, my probationary project was to migrate entire deployments from Flux CD into Spinnaker, which included figuring out how to integrate HC Vault without exposing secrets in the pipeline itself. If you look at my LinkedIn, I have details on the cool stuff I've worked on. I'm open to infra/SRE/devops as well as backend roles, regardless of seniority -- I've led a team for ~3 years but has since decided that being an IC allowed me more technical work, tinkering around with stuff and writing documentations (which I enjoy more). Being a tinkerer and loving to venture into the unknown, I have no qualms about learning new frameworks, technologies, or whatever esoteric stuff you need me to get up to speed to. reply",

Resume: LinkedIn -- https://www.linkedin.com/in/wcunning Email: wdocunningham \\@\\ gmail.com Background: Masters in control theory and signal processing, working in the auto industry for the last 7 years, first on low level powertrain software then the last year or so on LIDAR/computer vision for autonomous vehicles. I've done the most work in C, but I'm now contributing to safety development work with the Rust consortium and Ferrous Systems through my current employer. Recently had to read the Linux kernel source and use the BCC tool suite to find a subtle issue in the network stack causing high latency on sensor data for AV, also coincidentally fixed most of the network timing infrastructure. Currently doing software defined vehicle software architecture with a focus on fail-safe and fail-operational, loosely coupled, distributed systems. This includes some standards contributions and work with high level suppliers like Nvidia and Renesas for next-generation software/hardware system co-development. Primary skills include hard real time embedded systems, safety critical applications, firmware development, system integration and complex hardware/software interaction debugging, along with detailed data analysis problems. Side interests include machining, 3D printing, embedded system development, coffee roasting and furniture making. reply",

          "text": "Look, I am a very experienced Developer of nearly 20 years. I have worked on countless projects as both a Front End Developer and Backend (and UI designer in the past). I have worked with many startups, long-standing corporations, governments, many name brands (in which I'm sure you've even interacted with my work multiple times and wouldn't know it), and have had my own businesses in this field. I have single handily built applications seen by millions of public users and I would absolutely bet you are one of them. I began freelancing in high-school in the late 90s. I didn't learn development from a bootcamp, I was obsessed at an early age and understood the fundamentals of JavaScript well before front-end frameworks were a thing yet my experience with React, Vue, SolidJS, and many others has been the forefront of my work for the past 13 years or so (not SolidJS obviously). I know this market isn't great on both sides, and you could absolutely hire someone outside the US for cheaper (my rate is 65/hr negotiable btw), but you would definitely not get the same experience or outcome for your project. I am also available for local hybrid (Atlanta, GA), part-time, full-time, remote etc. and am I am absolutely devoted to the work that I do. My personal hobbies include upgrading and maintaining my on-premise k8s cluster (reddit post of the first iteration: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1li74m2/first_home... ) comprised of many various Single Board Computers with different archetectures to self\nhost my entire digital life for security and privacy, as well as teaching a small class about the fundamentals of electronics. My talent however lies strongly on the front end but my curiosity is in linux, open source, security, and so on.

          "text": "Shortcutting much of the discussion here (what are you goals / why would  you do that / don't use  format X):  a key problem is that neither HTML (as published on today's Web) nor PDF are reliable as canonical document formats.  Tagged-markup such as Markdown (or otherlightweight markup languages) or LaTeX (or other heavy markup languages) are far more robust.  Markdown has its variants, but all are pretty simple and easy to produce.  LaTeX is slightly more complex, but remains quite straightforward for simple works. Once you've got an appropriate canonical version in any of these options , you have an embarassment of riches to convert to any given document format (what I call endpoints) you'd care for:   PDF, HTML, RTF, DOCX, or many, many others.  I generally reach for Pandoc first, which itself, yes, of course, often relies on additional tools/libraries to parse or generate endpoints, but is quite versatile. You can simplify the intake of HTML by stripping out cruft.  Readability, Beautiful Soup, or other HTML filtering tools can target the core content and metadata you most likely want. Otherwise, think through what you're doing and why to more narrowly define your goals and tools.  E.g., if you want a faithful printed representation of a mainstream-browser-rendered page (that is, Google Chrome), you'd probably do best to use its print-to-PDF options (mentioned several times here).  If you want to extract core text, filtering out much of today's WWW cruft will be a high priority. reply",

          "text": "maybe html can do all of these and it will only cost me the time it takes to build the app, but right now PDF does all of those things for me, here today in my pocket, for $15. Which is nice. I'd love to see a text to speech engine that pronounces formatting but I think it might be more complicated than learning to pronounce something boldly. Am I yelling? Am I keeping my voice low but adding intensity? Can you automate answering that question in a way that's mostly correct most of the time? If something is in italics am I whispering, stage whispering, emphasizing or merely saying the title of an existing work out loud? It's a fundamental abuse of a text formatting engine to try to use it for speech formatting, you either have to use the existing tags for things they were never intended for or you have to start adding tags like <slywhisper> and <scream emotion=\"angry\"> vs <scream emotion=\"excited\">. That being said, an html-independent form of emotional text annotation might actually be a good idea as the inevitability of synthesized human voices being a part of our daily lives takes hold. I find PDFs easier to organize than HTML because HTML is any number of files referencing each other across a directory structure that can have any size or shape, and a PDF is a single file. If I'm searching my library for Bob Wilson, I want his books to show up and I want them to have his picture in them if that's how the book was published but I don't want Bob_Wilson.jpeg to show up as a result. I could automate print to PDF from html or use the tool someone else posted in order to condense my saved HTMLs to single files but that's more processing time and effort in order to get what I already have from a PDF Syncing position across HTML files may be doable, but syncing position across PDFs is done. You're absolutely right that that has nothing to do with the format but the (implied) question I was answering when I brought it up was why I would sometimes want one and other times want the other. That's why. Finally, and probably the only one that really matters inasmuch as all the other reasons can be coded around but this one cant: the places I get documents distribute them in PDF, mobi and epub but almost never in HTML reply",

It's also much more readable on different screen sizes, as the user can resize the window to whatever is comfortable on a 27\" screen, or fits on their pocket e-reader. You can even draw it on a canvas if you want to prevent people from extracting the decrypted strings (though it's evil, you have that option). There's only benefits! PDF is the lazy way to half-ass a read-only document while screwing, ahem, making anyone using a mobile phone zoom, pan, and squint.

If you only have HTML to work with, you can also use Flying Saucer[3], which is what KeenWrite uses to preview Markdown documents when rendered as HTML. Flying Saucer uses an open-source version of iText[4] to produce PDF documents (from HTML source docs). Another possibility is to use pandoc and LaTeX.

It’s got a decent ecosystem, command line, you can find gui’s if that’s your thing (no judgement, your lifestyle is none of my business). Many other good tools mentioned here as well, but if your asking because you need more, or fine grained (near infinite) control over the pdf composition, there’s nothing OSS I can think of that approaches its capabilities. https://ghostscript.com/ reply",

We usually did a phone screen (both technical and HR), then an on-site interview. The overall process wasn't much different for Ph.D. vs. Bachelors/Masters, but of course we asked very different questions depending on the level. Ph.D.-level positions were usually required to give a brief talk (partly to probe their communication skills.) For certain specific software automation positions, we did end up giving a coding test during the on-site interview. But no homework or multi-round stuff. The present situation in software is mostly the result of an oversupply of labor. Companies are endlessly picky because they can be. I am old enough to remember other recessions where companies could make ridiculous demands (once had a company demand I come in early Sunday morning for an interview, just to make sure I was truly committed to working 24/7. No thanks!) Recessions eventually end, although not always in a way that helps specific careers. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

A big challenge I have in bringing the service to new regions is just data access, both to raw hi-res map imagery as well as to satellite, LiDAR, etc so this is on my todo list to begin digging into what the Canadian government offers.

It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food.

          "text": "I've been working on a 3D voxel-based game engine for like 10 years in my spare time. The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

Trying it on real wood got expensive fast so for debugging runs and trials of designs I would run a simulation where the toolbit would hack out the shape out of a three dimensional array of voxels. This was then displayed using a very simple engine built with PyGame. I got a lot of use out of that and it saved days (and a small forest). Great to see something along those lines but with much better visuals. reply",

For site owners, cookie banners are an easy way to comply without having to DESIGN that compliance into their site, which can be interesting but time consuming and expensive. In theory, it should be possible to prompt the user for consent before storing something on their device but that would only work for stuff site owners have control over. In practice, \"cookies\" are rarely used voluntarily by the site owners themselves but they are used a lot by the crap they add to their sites for tracking and so on via tag managers.

          "text": "Lots of different possible scenarios here, but this is a super common thing in business. A couple of pointers: 1) Make sure you understand what they really want. It is common for a person to ask \"can your hardware run on 12V\", for example. But what they really want to know is something like \"can I use this on my solar powered RV that will be parked in a 122F desert\". This is just one of a billion examples from my career. You need to determine things like do they mean a stable 12.000V from a power supply, or a really variable 12VDC vehicle system that can range from 11-15V commonly. And then there is the whole ruggedness of the hardware issue. You need to be able to look ahead a bit and often assume the person isn't really asking the question they want an answer to. 2) The best way to be successful in business is to predict the future :)  By this I mean determine how to set achievable expectations. If you feel confident that you can get an answer by COB, then state that and do it (predict the future, make it come true). 3) Communicate commitment and honesty. It is ok to tell someone you don't know, but you can say this in a lot of ways. Depending on all the variables, saying something like \"this seems possible, but I need to check with X\", or \"I believe we did something similar for another situation, let me get more data internally and get back to you by tomorrow morning\", etc. If you want to setup a coaching session I'm happy to do a 30 minute zoom/whatever. reply",

Think of those as L1 or L2 cache hits. Then, for the remainder that are #2, you can say \"sorry, I don't have anything to hand, haven't thought about that, but I could look into it and get back to you with something in X amount of time, if that's useful. should we create a ticket, and prioritize this alongside other priorities?\". The thing that will inspire confidence is not saying this all the time, but only for the non-#1 things, and that many things are #1 and get an immediate response. It's also powerful to build these constructs into questions of other people. You could ask \"Hey, Bob - I'm wondering, do you know, off the top of your head, where the code that does X is?\". Ideally, Bob can then say, \"oh, yes, I was just looking at that yesterday, it's here: http://....\", or alternatively \"Hmm. Actually, no, sorry.\". An annoying non-answer would be \"No, but it's probably in place X, because Y, or maybe it's Z, or it could be found using git history or blah blah blah...\" - that's not helpful, because if it needs to _searched for_, you can do that just as well as Bob, the question was whether he had it _to hand_, not whether he could make some guesses about where it _could_ be... reply",

But this problem kinda requires personalized advice. > in a way that doesn’t make it seem like I can’t be trusted that I know what I’m doing. Why do you feel this way? I can think of several possibilities: 1.) You really really want the ability to know the answer instantly. While your mind know that's not reasonable, your heart is disappointed. As a result, your body language sends the message you don't know what you're doing. 2.) Verbal interactions are tough and you're looking for the right canned phrase that will give you time to think. However, that canned phrase sounds practiced, and people mistake it for a canned i-dont-care response. 3.) You want to people to understand why you don't instantly have an answer. As a result, you provide far too much justification, which winds up sounding guilty. Personally, I have had great success with encounters where I absolutely don't know the answer, and I barely know where to start. Charlie asks me a question. I reply \"I don't know, but Bob might know!\" We ask Bob, and he doesn't want to be bothered, but he does know that Fred should know the answer. We then go to Fred, and I pay attention as the other two talk. I learn about Fred, a new topic, and Charlie winds up thanking me the most. In the future, Charlie comes to me first instead of Bob or Fred, and I wind up learning more than Bob and Fred put together. It wasn't about how I said it, it was about putting in the effort to be present.\nAnd then people remembered I'd actually put the effort in. reply",

          "text": "How much do you know? One of my strongest things as somebody who's looked to as a person who knows a lot, is that I will immediately go to 'I don't know' when asked that sort of question. I don't even make an additional promise, I just stop at 'I don't know'. With your emphasis on 'confidently', it sounds like you're looking at social consequences. I find that stopping the conversation with 'I don't know' and getting on with what I'm doing, socially 'reads' as authoritative. I'm sure part of it is my lack of equivocation: if I went 'I'll get back to you, I promise I swear I'll be able to know eventually, soon, I promise, pinky swear I will honest!' there would obviously be no authority, I'd be grovelling. I could probably double down, unethically. 'I don't know, what a stupid question, why would you even ask that malformed question, that's not a real question'. I think that would lead to suspicion, though. 'I don't know' can be a power move, if you HAVE the confidence to mean it and let it lie there. I guess that's the answer. \"I don't know. This is what I'm actively doing now…\" This relies very much on there being many things you do know… reply",

So I have written scripts to check out all repos under a given org for github, so I pre clone before meeting with them.

I have even generalized the spark thing so I can answer many many questions from the logs in a day. I tell people when I don't know, but I enhance my ability to find out (and then try to get teams to productize similar tools when I think it is of general value) Truth be told, Claude code excels at these sorts of tools, much more than at production high thru put applications. reply",

          "text": "I was a consultant for many years. You can definitely buy yourself time (see below), but always make sure you understand why the question is being asked, and how your answer will be used. Sometimes people just ask questions in meetings to sound important. • If it's theoretically possible to answer: \"You know, that is such a great question, and I want to be able to give you a thoughtful answer. Let me take it offline and get back to you tomorrow with [a concrete plan|my recommendations|a few options|a potential solution].\" • If it's impossible to answer in the moment (you need to access data or run a report): \"That would be interesting to see! I could probably crunch that for you in ___ days/hours. Right now I'm currently working on ____. Should I put that work on pause while I get the answer for you?\" or\n\n  \"I'd have to spend a little time to dig into that. Should we add it to the backlog?\" • If they're expecting an assessment/judgment/snap decision: \"Fair question, but it's a bit more nuanced than you might think, so I'd like to look at it more closely. If I answer now, you're just getting my own bias.\" • If it's something unexpected/random (happens often): \"Oh, I hadn't considered that. Can you give me a little insight about the reason for the question? I'd love to know what's behind your interest in ____.\" or\n\n  \"Ah, interesting. Are you just asking out of curiosity, or is there a deeper reason for the question?\" or\n\n  \"Wow, I would be curious to know the answer to that too. Why do you ask?\" • If it's a technical question, especially a \"gotcha\" question: \"You know, I am honestly flattered that you think I would know that off the top of my head, but I'm actually a big believer in documentation and researching best practices. I can check for you.\" • If you don't understand what they'll do with the answer: \"We can certainly get an answer on that, but just so I know how best to respond, can you help me understand how this will be used as an input? Put another way, what's the action or behavior this will change?\" • If it sounds like they're fishing for a specific answer: \"It's a good question, but I get the sense that you already have an idea in mind. What are your thoughts?\" • If it's an aggressive or hostile question: \"I get it, it's frustrating. Before I answer, do you want to press pause and talk about what's really going on?\" or\n\n  \"Happy to answer, but if this is about me or my performance, why don't we take it offline so you can give me some feedback 1:1.\" Honestly the list is endless reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

On the other hand, he also said that if you're really serious about your idea you should absolutely invest in it as much as you're realistically able to (finances, time, and effort) without putting yourself in an un-survivable bind. reply",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

You did mention you liked programming, but was that triggered by the glamor and promise? 2. Assuming that it is still to do with computers.

I imagine in Iraq (or where ever you are) there are many small businesses and non-technical people who need their computers maintained and repaired (example, this guy has posted on HN and has a small business that does this : https://www.scottrlarson.com/services/computer/repair/ .. I am not affiliated in any way with him). You might need to hit the street, ignore the fear / embarrassment / rejection, and cold call or cold visit businesses. If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3.

Your particular combination will be rare, this is where you are most likely to be able to find and solve problems. Since you’re a programmer you are very well suited for that type of analysis.

Once you decide on the job you what to get then define a plan that outlines how to get the job you want. Part of that plan might mean getting any job you qualify for even if it's not what you want right now. Once you get your foot in the door then you can work towards getting promoted or transferred to the department where you want to work. Also, join any organization where you might get contacts that will help your career. A vast majority of jobs are found by who you know not what you know. This might mean that you will have to move to a different city but you do what you need to do to survive. reply",

One way I was told how to find product (your service) and market (labor market) fit is to focus on the problem. Sell yourself as a problem solver rather than a software developer. The software is just a tool, and software engineering is a framework to apply those tools in practice. Although the current state of your locale lacks software dev opportunities, it might also be that most people aren't aware of their needs for digitization yet. Software is also in a lot of things.

          "text": "This is the central struggle we are all facing throughout our lives, in different degrees: what do you hold on to, when do you let go, what do you replace it with? The local issue you have is with a career goal that has not panned out, do you hold on to the dream or do you ‘face reality’ as people in your life and here would urge you to do. What adversity does is challenge our attachment profile. This helps the timid hoarder, who wants to keep everything, by forcing them to choose. They learn a stronger, purer, sense of self in the process. A lesson we can’t seem to learn as fast, voluntarily. Victor Frankl describes it in great detail as a holocaust survivor in Man’s Search For Meaning. So embrace your hardship. Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up. But for the rest, maybe introduce flexibility, experiment more. You have an opinion on these other opportunities not being worth it, but what have you tried? You see things up close that the ruminating knee hugger simply won’t ever see by thought alone. reply",

For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

          "text": "> Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. Perhaps you are, but this is not universal for philosophers. Most modern day philosophers do not believe in any god. > Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Judaism does not accept any of the claimed fulfilments of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus[0]. > Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. I don't see how that follows. > Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. This is just your opinion: I'm sure Jesus was a remarkable character, but I don't see how it's clear that he was god. From my point of view he was just a normal person and didn't have the authority to start a valid religion. > The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years Respectfully disagree with both. The smartest people I know have figured out it's nonsense. > And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Here I think I can agree with you that the church is an antidote to 99% of the problems modern people are suffering from. Though I think there are other ways too.

          "text": "There was a time I was thinking in similar vibes, but came to realization this is actually oversimplification. 1. if there are jobs offering high pay, and there are people who get them- these jobs are not overpaid, clearly some people want to pay high and there are other people who deliver (and of course there are other who fake it, but it's not a norm) 2. not all people are equal, and not all jobs are equal, and just because 'it feels unfair' does not mean it is unfair. Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

Through the platform, I discovered FAANG(current employer for 6yrs now), Leetcode, structured ways to prepare for interviews, and even the fact that sign-on bonuses exist, something I had no idea about before. Teamblind has been so impactful for me that I’m more than happy to pay for it. While there’s certainly noise on the platform, I’ve learned to focus on the insightful conversations and resources that matter. If you are in the US it might not be so useful, but for us outside, it is gold. I've been on HN for way longer than Blind, but Blind had had the most impact in my career & I'm grateful for that. reply",

For interviews, I search company-specific tags to find discussions and tips, ChatGPT makes it even easier now to extract insights from those threads. I also use it for compensation research. Occasionally, I’ll check company gossip, and I have to say, Blind has correctly predicted layoffs at my employer twice. Beneath all the noise, some people really do share valuable inside information. That’s why I treat Blind as a data-gathering tool, not a hangout. I mainly open it for interviews, negotiations, compensation benchmarks, or to get the general sentiment around a company. Honestly, I wish they had an API like Reddit’s, it would make pulling insights so much easier. reply",

I understand this website is mostly used by people living in the US, but other countries and people have a very different understanding of... work and pay. The truth is that \"UBI\" already exists in most countries, one could argue that even in the US already does, in form of food stamps etc. Here in Germany you get housing, food and everything if you can't find a job. In Brazil you also get money so you can eat. It isn't as expensive as one might think to cover basic needs to people, as well, this makes them consume which makes the economy function well. If AI reshapes society so most human jobs aren't necessary, UBI would be pointless as it stems from the existence of capitalism as it is. I'm not preaching about communism, but rather a different economic system. How that economic system will be? Nobody knows. reply",

          "text": "To answer the question literally,  I don't think it is possible to know. There are a lot of elements at play. - There are valid concerns about the dangers of AI. - There are hysterically overblown claims about the dangers of AI - There is public resentment growing proportionally to wealth inequality.   The  costs of AI development means that it is being done by those who can afford it, people are \nsuspicious of their motives - There are people who feel that humans are in some way special, for religious or dogmatic reasons.  There are many here on hacker news who are prepared to claim that LLMs (and computers in general) will never be capable of consciousness.   As behaviours of AI's get closer to what looks like consciousness to some, their objections to the possibility will only grow louder. - How a UBI is implemented is as important as it's existence. - Many people believe that work is what gives life meaning.   I think this is in decline as wealth inequality increases.   I think increasing numbers of people are thinking that the notion that work brings meaning is conditioned by society to allow people to be exploited. Ultimately, in the long term, something must happen.   If AI renders a huge proportion of the population without work, then that will cause seismic shifts. The distinction between UBI and work is the belief that you are owed a livelihood vs being owed a Job.  If people who are no longer employed due to AI end up starving,  there _will_ be revolution or subjugation. If people who are rendered jobless are given the means to survive, they will want a vocation.  If they do not find their higher needs met then they will agitate for improvements.   One of the strongest moderators of public disquiet has been Jobs,  it keeps people busy, while giving them a means of survival that has the potential to be lost.    It occupies the time of the worker while making them risk averse. Take away the jobs and you grant people time to organise and removes the risk of loosing ones job. Once people are in this state there are not very many possible paths,  Either governments will facilitate progressive improvement in peoples lives to give them meaning, or they will not.  This is obviously true because it must be one or the other ( either A or NOT A) If things improve, we win.   If they do not improve, then you have an idle population with nothing to lose.   The only alternatives are revolution or subjugation(or worse, genocide).   Revolution becomes essentially a roll of the dice where there is a chance of improvement but just as often leads to subjugation or another revolution. There surely are those who imagine becoming powerful by owning machines that can do the work of millions.  I don't believe they understand the consequences that would occur should they reach that goal. Then finally the thing that places this in the unknowable range, is we don't know if or when superintelligent AI will appear.  Perhaps it will find a better way.  It would be hard to imagine it being superintelligent and not coming up with a better solution for the crap we've landed ourselves in. reply",

Is any kind of state service by definition bad now? Ah, here's the difference: You're considering UBI based on the idea that \"if governments behave well and to the interest of the people, UBI is fine too\". I'm starting from real world governments and their real world behaviors, not fantasy. In the real world, total control of hundreds of millions of people livelihood via a standardized UBI scheme, is a huge additional government tool for abuse. And the extra reach and power it gives government, and the constant dependency it adds, it's a totally new game. And that's not compared to some dictatorship or \"emergency powers\" (which duh!, can be more abusive), UBI would be a steadily available tool for low-burning abuse and subtle control. > Heck, we could even unnecessarily complicate the issue by putting the UBI responsibility on an extra governmental body, neither state nor private Ah, yes, like the FED for example. Controlled by government but also unaccountable when it's more convenient to those in power. > Your pessimistic stance on goverments hinders you from accurately describing problems with it, which means you cant articulate constructive solutions too Actually my pragmatic stance on governments (\"pessimistic\" and \"optimistic\" stances are for people unconnected with reality, of course the latter way more so), which means I'm not in favor in giving them huge guns to extend their power more, especially given their track record. But if you look at the world around you, and think \"it's pretty neat\", more power to you. reply",

There was even a mongo DB compatibility layer for foundation DB, but it doesn't seem to be maintained sadly. https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer reply",

Most of the time all I need is just a csv-like structure of the data I'm working with and I had a very difficult time with just getting something like that. Joining tables tended to be difficult where the pivot points between relationships was rather semantically unbounded, so it was difficult for me to create a reasonably rigid mental model of the data I was working with. That was especially noticeable in some of the API documentation I worked with -- where a simple REST-like API just gives a simple, usually flat, json... graphql api responses were deeply nested and often in implementation-dependent ways[1] of thousands of lines. Which has IME made explorability practically impossible. GraphQL implementations have consistently felt like a hobby project where implementing it in an API becomes a thing to put on a resume rather than making a functionally useful API.

The longer the change takes, the better in this situation as they can just chill while the change is taking place and polish resume for the next gig if it doesn't work out. If they jump to a new job before failure is obvious they can claim that they affected some large change at previous company and repeat the process.

          "text": "Graph RAG is great, but misunderstood. As a human user, consider file-system navigation or code search. You navigate to a seed file, and then hop through the children and dependencies until you find what you're looking for. The value is in explicit and direct edges. Perfect search is hard. Landing in the right neighborhood is less so. (It's like golf if you think about it) Agentic systems loop through the following steps - (Plan -> Inquire -> Retrieve -> Observe -> Act -> Repeat). The agent interacts with your search-system during the inquire and retrieve phases. In these phrases, There are 2 semantic problems that a simple embedding based search or a simple db alone can't solve: seeding and completeness. Seeding - How do you ask a good question when you don't know what you don't know ? Completeness -  once you know a little bit, how do you know that you have obtained everything you need to answer a question ? A solid embedding based search allows under-defined free-form inquiry, and puts the user near the data they're looking for. From there, an explicit graph allows the agent to navigate through the edges until it hits gold or gives the agent enough signal to retry with better informed free-form inquiry. Together, they solve the seeding problem. Now, once you have found a few seed nodes to work off of, the agent can keep exploring the neighbors, until they become sufficiently irrelevant. At that threshold, the retrieval system can return the explored nodes with a measurable metric of confidence in completeness. This makes completeness a measure that you can optimize, helping solve the 2nd problem. You'll notice that there is no magic here. The quality of your search will depend on the quality of your edges, entities, exploration strategy and relevance detectors. This requires a ton of hand-engineering and subject specific domain knowledge, neither of which are systems bottlenecks. The data-store itself will do very little to help get you a better answer. Which brings me to your question, the datastore. The datastore only matters at sufficient scale. You CAN implement Graph RAG in a standard database. Get a column to track your edges, a column to track entities and some way to search over embeddings and you're good. You can get it done in an afternoon (until permissions become an issue, but I digress). We know that a spotlight style file-system search works just fine on 100k+ documents, while your mac's fan barely even turns on. If you're asking this question, then your company probably doesn't scale past that point. In fact, I'd argue that few companies will ever cross that threshold for agentic operations. At this scale, your postgres instance won't be the bottleneck. Comparing postgres to graph-rag-startups, the real value of using a native graph-RAG solution is their defaults. The companies know that their user's need is agentic semantic search, and the products come preloaded with defaults that give you embeddings, entities and graph-edges that aren't completely useless. From a practical standpoint, those extras might push you over the edge. But be aware that your performance gains are coming from outsourcing the hand-engineering of features and not the data structure itself. My personal opinion is to keep the data structure as simple as possible. MLEs and Data Scientists are mediocre systems engineers and it is okay to accept that. You want your ML & product team to be able to iterate on the search-logic and quality as fast as possible. That's where the real gains will come from. Speaking from experience, premature optimization in a new field will slow your team down to a crawl. IE. Go with postgres if that's what's simple for everyone to work with. tldr: It's not about the scalability of the datastructure, it's about how you use it. reply",

You might not need that $100k/month “big data” setup.\n  Architecting a market maker entirely made of PostgreSQL triggers that made markets on 6 pairs for the 180 days it took for the pros to come over with their C++.\n  Setting up Mechanical Turk like labelling to reclassify an online shop’s entire catalog overnight for $400; we found 10% were misclassified (I could do this with, or for AI today). I also built https://gutensearch.com/ - mostly as an experiment to show the power and simplicity of Postgres FTS. It is somehow still running, and remains (AFAIK) the only way to look inside Project Gutenberg books. After a stint running a startup and doing a lot of conference hand shaking, I am returning to my roots getting my hands dirty with data problems.

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives.

With all that said, I'm open to having a conversation with anyone. Thanks! :) reply",

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip - Community engagement platform for soccer fans. Built a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it! reply",

This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team.  An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development.  It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I'm a Product Engineer and a creative based in London. I’ve built full-stack applications across web, mobile, blockchain and embedded platforms. My client-side work includes React, Electron, Roku’s Scenegraph, and native iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, always with a strong focus on UX and design-first thinking. On the service-side, I’ve worked with traditional service hosting, containers, and serverless, including (but not limited to) AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Workers, CloudFormation, SAM CLI, nodejs, bunjs, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, grpc, Redis, Docker, nginx, and a few legacy tools best left unnamed (yes, including CodeIgniter and ftp). I’ve also developed developer tools like CLIs and SDKs, primarily JavaScript land, and have written code in systems languages such as Rust and Zig. In the AI space, I’ve integrated models via the OpenAI SDK, leveraged prompts, LLMs, and explored LangChain/LangGraph. I care about clean code, great UX, developer experience, documentation (yes), rapid iteration and automating workflows with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bash scripts, etc).

While my core competency is frontend and the React ecosystem, I can navigate the full stack confidently and contribute to most any codebase.  I've worked on products sitting atop PHP, C#/.NET, Python, Rails and Node. The bulk of my experience is in startups (B2C, B2B & SaaS), though I am open to any organization that provides a strong culture fit.  In my experience, culture and team dynamics far outways what is being built - or the tech that is being used.  I am growth oriented and passionate about working collaboratively, cross-functionally, and making a meaningful impact in people's lives with what is built. I'm also unafraid of legacy code or tech debt. Note: My current role and location is in St Thomas, USVI.  After my last startup role, my family and I decided to try something new and see if life in the Virgin Islands could work for us.  In short, it did not.  My family is already in WA, and I am here finishing up my role as IT Coordinator.  I will be joining my family in WA at the end of November. reply",

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me!

          "text": "Look, I am a very experienced Developer of nearly 20 years. I have worked on countless projects as both a Front End Developer and Backend (and UI designer in the past). I have worked with many startups, long-standing corporations, governments, many name brands (in which I'm sure you've even interacted with my work multiple times and wouldn't know it), and have had my own businesses in this field. I have single handily built applications seen by millions of public users and I would absolutely bet you are one of them. I began freelancing in high-school in the late 90s. I didn't learn development from a bootcamp, I was obsessed at an early age and understood the fundamentals of JavaScript well before front-end frameworks were a thing yet my experience with React, Vue, SolidJS, and many others has been the forefront of my work for the past 13 years or so (not SolidJS obviously). I know this market isn't great on both sides, and you could absolutely hire someone outside the US for cheaper (my rate is 65/hr negotiable btw), but you would definitely not get the same experience or outcome for your project. I am also available for local hybrid (Atlanta, GA), part-time, full-time, remote etc. and am I am absolutely devoted to the work that I do. My personal hobbies include upgrading and maintaining my on-premise k8s cluster (reddit post of the first iteration: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1li74m2/first_home... ) comprised of many various Single Board Computers with different archetectures to self\nhost my entire digital life for security and privacy, as well as teaching a small class about the fundamentals of electronics.

The only real problem is that the lenses can get sweaty or foggy and all of a sudden I go from punching faces and dodging fists to punching at blurs and failing to dodge other blurs. Maybe instead of a quest you just display video to a screen? When I was using a hotel fitness center they had a peloton and that seems to be something you can do with those. It was a couple years back and I recall the video being loosely if at all tied to the speed you pedal at, but it was more fun than just looking at a wall while I pretend to go somewhere. reply",

          "text": "maybe html can do all of these and it will only cost me the time it takes to build the app, but right now PDF does all of those things for me, here today in my pocket, for $15. Which is nice. I'd love to see a text to speech engine that pronounces formatting but I think it might be more complicated than learning to pronounce something boldly. Am I yelling? Am I keeping my voice low but adding intensity? Can you automate answering that question in a way that's mostly correct most of the time? If something is in italics am I whispering, stage whispering, emphasizing or merely saying the title of an existing work out loud? It's a fundamental abuse of a text formatting engine to try to use it for speech formatting, you either have to use the existing tags for things they were never intended for or you have to start adding tags like <slywhisper> and <scream emotion=\"angry\"> vs <scream emotion=\"excited\">. That being said, an html-independent form of emotional text annotation might actually be a good idea as the inevitability of synthesized human voices being a part of our daily lives takes hold. I find PDFs easier to organize than HTML because HTML is any number of files referencing each other across a directory structure that can have any size or shape, and a PDF is a single file. If I'm searching my library for Bob Wilson, I want his books to show up and I want them to have his picture in them if that's how the book was published but I don't want Bob_Wilson.jpeg to show up as a result. I could automate print to PDF from html or use the tool someone else posted in order to condense my saved HTMLs to single files but that's more processing time and effort in order to get what I already have from a PDF Syncing position across HTML files may be doable, but syncing position across PDFs is done. You're absolutely right that that has nothing to do with the format but the (implied) question I was answering when I brought it up was why I would sometimes want one and other times want the other. That's why. Finally, and probably the only one that really matters inasmuch as all the other reasons can be coded around but this one cant: the places I get documents distribute them in PDF, mobi and epub but almost never in HTML reply",

It's also much more readable on different screen sizes, as the user can resize the window to whatever is comfortable on a 27\" screen, or fits on their pocket e-reader. You can even draw it on a canvas if you want to prevent people from extracting the decrypted strings (though it's evil, you have that option). There's only benefits!

          "text": "Shortcutting much of the discussion here (what are you goals / why would  you do that / don't use  format X):  a key problem is that neither HTML (as published on today's Web) nor PDF are reliable as canonical document formats.  Tagged-markup such as Markdown (or otherlightweight markup languages) or LaTeX (or other heavy markup languages) are far more robust.  Markdown has its variants, but all are pretty simple and easy to produce.  LaTeX is slightly more complex, but remains quite straightforward for simple works. Once you've got an appropriate canonical version in any of these options , you have an embarassment of riches to convert to any given document format (what I call endpoints) you'd care for:   PDF, HTML, RTF, DOCX, or many, many others.  I generally reach for Pandoc first, which itself, yes, of course, often relies on additional tools/libraries to parse or generate endpoints, but is quite versatile. You can simplify the intake of HTML by stripping out cruft.  Readability, Beautiful Soup, or other HTML filtering tools can target the core content and metadata you most likely want. Otherwise, think through what you're doing and why to more narrowly define your goals and tools.  E.g., if you want a faithful printed representation of a mainstream-browser-rendered page (that is, Google Chrome), you'd probably do best to use its print-to-PDF options (mentioned several times here).  If you want to extract core text, filtering out much of today's WWW cruft will be a high priority. reply",

If you have the original document (in Markdown), one possibility would be to use my software, KeenWrite[1], to convert Markdown to XHTML then typeset XHTML to PDF via ConTeXt. See the user manual[2] for an example of a Markdown document typeset in this fashion, along with usage instructions. If you only have HTML to work with, you can also use Flying Saucer[3], which is what KeenWrite uses to preview Markdown documents when rendered as HTML. Flying Saucer uses an open-source version of iText[4] to produce PDF documents (from HTML source docs). Another possibility is to use pandoc and LaTeX.

          "text": "Absinthe Labs | Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE / NYC Hybrid | Full-Time About us:\nAbsinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving:\nTracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports. Why it matters:\nThis infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance. The role:\nWe’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack: Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing. See open positions here: absinthe.network/careers#open-positions Get involved:\n- Explore product functionalities at: https://guides.absinthe.network - Explore the Adapter Library docs: https://docs.absinthe.network/ - Join our Slack community to hack on adapters and connect with the team: https://join.slack.com/t/absinthecommunity/shared_invite/zt-... reply",

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and are already rolling out across some of the largest care chains across Europe, including most of the NHS. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We’re especially keen to talk to Staff Engineers (backend) and Senior AI Engineers (e.g. LLMs and the scaffolding around, computer-use agents) Even if we don’t have a role out  your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want. We're getting big enough to start splitting into more focused teams and there's a few different areas that we need; our infra needs a lot of work, we have big dreams for some cool AI agent/pipeline work and there's still a lot of more fundamental phone system specific problems we need to solve. We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can! You'll need to visit our London office roughly once a month. Email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring? reply",

          "text": "I worked here for a few months several years ago - justifiably let go for non-performance, it was a strange time in my life and I had a lot of distractions, it was an amicable separation. While they expect consistent high performance, the bar is reasonable and the hours can be a bit long for some but aren't insane. Everyone at the company is smart and driven. Both founders are highly technical, very passionate, genuinely business-savvy, and great with customers. Abe Erdos is borderline polymath genius - topics like wavelet decomposition are relatively pedestrian to Abe, and he seems equally comfortable in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science (all of which are critical to this business). Abe's also a good listener, it's easy to underestimate him and difficult to overestimate him. Ken Miller has more energy than anyone I've ever seen, a very broad and reasonably deep understanding of pretty much everything, and generally has strong opinions - if you want to challenge his roadmap, it's best to stay one step ahead of him and show rather than tell. It's a fairly mature product, but the business still moves at a much faster pace than the rest of their industry and they constantly innovate. They stay on top of technological changes; they rarely take more than a year to adopt something new that is applicable to their products. Has the feeling of a \"very stable start-up\". They truly own both the hardware and data end-to-end, which is very helpful. They have expertise and ownership of every level of abstraction - they'll build Helmholtz coils in-house to calibrate instruments on custom PCBs designed and soldered in-house, while managing distributed systems from edge to datacenter, run their products at customer sites, maintain personal relationships with their customers and employees, and deal with legal action directly themselves. If you're interested - understand that what might take 1-3 months at a large corporation is often accomplished in a few days to a week here. Working, manipulable demos are appreciated over presentations. If discussion hits a wall where it's impossible to know whether going direction A or B is correct, they will simply pick one direction to explore rather than deliberate further and they'll use that exploration to gain more information, open to backtracking and going the other direction, but only if it's profitable to do so. Every person there has built a lot, either product or business. They focus on building things that don't suck, and they don't have much patience for things that do. So generally you won't have to worry about being forced to use crappy tools that make you miserable. There are a LOT of different personalities in the company, all strong in their own ways (some quiet, some loud, some blunt) so it's probably best if you are the type of person who can work with a variety of personalities - but this isn't a euphemism to indicate toxic personalities - if you're high energy and passionate you'll feel at home, sometimes opinions can fly fast and hot but the best results are gained by communicating clearly and decisively, not emotionally. Some employees are quieter and it's often best to be quieter with them and listen more. Keeping an emotional buffer/distance between you and work decisions made by your colleagues/bosses will help a lot. If there's loud direct criticism, it's about the work - not the person. Most of their employees are on-location, but they integrate remote workers well enough - quite a few excellent employees work remotely and communication is good. You might miss some in-person chatter but you won't be completely blindsided (at least not much more than anyone else in a company that makes decisions faster than you can complete a story point). When I was there, compensation was definitely reasonable - I was comfortable. It's an MCOL, but we had a competent developer in NY who stayed with the company through the tech boom years. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

I haven't seen that much of it, but from what I have seen, the fidelity is quite low.  It would be cool to see what a good game studio could produce. Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.  In every surgery there is a rep from the implant company, and those reps are really the ones doing the training. So there is certainly potential but it's just not to the point where people are excited about it. reply",

Over the years I experimented a bit with leaflet.js and thought of overlaying maps too so you can navigate maps through time, but quickly realized it was super difficult. Kudos for setting this up! If you want to expand to other regions, or chat, or get access to high-res scans, let me know. I think plenty of old maps sellers would love to sell their maps this way. reply",

It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "That is so neat. I built something a little bit like this for a simulator of a 3D portal mill. Trying it on real wood got expensive fast so for debugging runs and trials of designs I would run a simulation where the toolbit would hack out the shape out of a three dimensional array of voxels. This was then displayed using a very simple engine built with PyGame. I got a lot of use out of that and it saved days (and a small forest). Great to see something along those lines but with much better visuals. reply",

For small and medium robotics companies, this can really slow down iteration.<p>I’m trying to understand:<p>• How do you/your team currently manage and analyze robot data?<p>• What are the biggest pain points you face (e.g. debugging failures, comparing test runs, searching across logs)?<p>• Have you tried tools like Foxglove/Rerun/etc.? What works, what doesn’t?<p>• If there was a solution that actually made this easier, what would it have to do for you to adopt it?<p>I also put together a short (5 min) survey here: https://forms.gle/x57UReg8Yj9Gx7qZ8<p>If you’re willing to share your experiences in more detail, it would really help shape what we’re building.<p>We’ll anonymize responses and share the aggregated insights back with the community once we’ve collected enough.<p>Thanks in advance — I know this is a niche problem, but I figured HN has some of the sharpest robotics engineers, founders, and tinkerers out there. Really curious to hear how you’re solving this today.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Full disclosure, I work at Foxglove right now. Before joining, I spent over seven years consulting and had more than 50 clients during that period. Here are some thoughts: * Combing through the syslogs to find issues is an absolute nightmare, even more so if you are told that the machine broke at some point last night * Even if you find the error, it's not necessarily when something broke; it could have happened way before, but you just discovered it because the system hit a state that required it * If combing through syslog is hard, try rummaging through multiple mcap files by hand to see where a fault happened * The hardware failing silently is a big PITA - this is especially true for things that read analog signals (think PLCs) Many of the above issues can be solved with the right architecture or tooling, but often the teams I joined didn't have it, and lacked the capacity to develop it. At Foxglove, we make it easy to aggregate and visualize the data and have some helper features (e.g., events, data loaders) that can speed up workflows. However, I would say that having good architecture, procedures, and an aligned team goes a long way in smoothing out troubleshooting, regardless of the tools. reply",

Recovering my GitHub has proven to be more painful than Google's treatment regarding my Google Workspace.<p>I have the original phone number associated with my account, and can verify a bunch of private repos that are associated with my account—even the number of commits on one of them (almost 6900). I can't, however, provide any 2FA codes or backup codes because they are printed on paper that has, I assume, been destroyed.<p>I maintain two relatively popular Ruby packages that have gone stale since I've been gone, and there are projects my GitHub there that I was working on prior to my incarceration—including a SaaS I had hoped to launch post-prison and two books I was ready to publish. Having said, just opening another account isn't exactly the option I want to take.<p>I've opened a ticket, but I'm getting the \"shit out of luck because we don't know you are you\" treatment.

The situation you are in is very unfortunate and I am sympathetic but in GitHub's defence, this is exactly what I hope would happen when I enable 2FA. I would be very perturbed to find out that GitHub would grant access to my account given identity documents. There are some creative solutions (e.g: a countdown to the reset with progressively more aggressive email notifications to ensure the account holder is aware) but even they are problematic.

The GitHub policy is: you lose your 2FA, you lose your account. Verifying your identity is not relevant. GitHub provides extensive tooling to protect your account (multiple methods of 2FA, recovery codes etc.) and so from their perspective, while this is deeply unfortunate, the policy is very clear and allowing you access to the account would be a major security issue (not for your account specifically, but for GitHub as an organization). edit: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/g... reply",

          "text": "I’m not sure that blaming tech support for not understanding context is the best approach here. The other sides of that context, which are  understandable from their point of view, is that you were charged with some serious crimes. There’s a large delta between the charges and the conviction, but you’ve got some scary words written about you online. Secondarily, GitHub has policy so whereas you’re coming at it from a position of being correct, they’re in a position where they have to break policy. That’s a big risk. Your best bet would likely be legal. US Federal law imposes some strict rules on lawyers for identity verification to combat money laundering so attorneys have a legally recognized toolkit to verify identity. Having a third party who works for you in the mix could help. Though again, it would involve breaking their policy so this would be a decision made several layers above Zendesk access. Otherwise, I think this is doing precisely what 2FA is meant to do. It’s not okay for you and you’ve clearly lost a lot because of this, but with the current threat environment, GitHub has to be very careful especially with 2FA. From their point of view, there likely isn’t that big of a gap between your interactions and interactions with people who are trying to take over accounts. A lawyer may not work, but it sure changes that equation. reply",

I tried the normal means (support tickets etc) to no avail. The third or fourth time I got someone in account recovery. There was a very formal process for verifying my identity (I'm sure based on the process this happens all the time). Eventually I they helped me recover my account. It probably took a few months on the whole, but once I got the right support rep it was only a week or so. So my advice would be to submit more tickets.

Doesn't guarantee success, but adds weight - GH (being part of MSFT) does have some channels for escalated identity verification. Lawyers or notarized ID may be needed...possibly expensive, but sometimes the only way GH support is extremely strict on account recovery once 2FA/backup codes are gone. I wish you luck! reply",

In your  reply to this, please acknowledge your receipt of my email, and if you can, print it out as well, as it can become inaccessible later. Of course, there are a lot of NSA-affiliated people who could come out of the woodworks to support parent's slander that I \"sound paranoid and schizophrenic\". The reason they don't? They're witnesses in the FBI case and don't want to go to prison themselves. The FBI has already handwritten over 10,000 affidavits in this case. (They are writing by hand to avoid electronic tampering with evidence.) I am not making a media story about it yet, which would be the next step, so there are no articles about this yet. My reason for not doing so is not to bring extra attention to the case, but simply to solve it in a straightforward and expedient manner. reply",

We usually did a phone screen (both technical and HR), then an on-site interview. The overall process wasn't much different for Ph.D. vs. Bachelors/Masters, but of course we asked very different questions depending on the level. Ph.D.-level positions were usually required to give a brief talk (partly to probe their communication skills.) For certain specific software automation positions, we did end up giving a coding test during the on-site interview. But no homework or multi-round stuff. The present situation in software is mostly the result of an oversupply of labor. Companies are endlessly picky because they can be. I am old enough to remember other recessions where companies could make ridiculous demands (once had a company demand I come in early Sunday morning for an interview, just to make sure I was truly committed to working 24/7. No thanks!) Recessions eventually end, although not always in a way that helps specific careers. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "Jennifer Senior wrote a great piece back in 2006 about burnout [1] titled \"Can’t Get No Satisfaction\". It's worth reading the whole thing. Here are some fragments that stuck with me: > we think of burnout as the gap between expectations and rewards > happiness equals reality divided by expectations > level of caring couldn’t be sustained in the absence of results How have you been framing your side project? Is your side project intended to be a business? If so, what outputs is the business achieving (revenue, profit, your effective hourly wage as the owner operator)?  Dispassionately, is it doing well enough commercially that it makes sense to continue to pursue this business? In the case where this side project has not been achieving sufficient commercial results, and has been falling short of your expectations and the goals you set yourself, is it possible that your resistance to continuing working on the side project is because subconsciously your body has decided it is not a good use of additional time and energy? It could be beneficial and healthy if you could give yourself a long break from thinking and focusing on your side project, to get your brain out of this habit of focusing on the side project and give it the opportunity to think and focus on some new things, or just to rest. From my experience (not with side projects but with job related burnout)  consider taking a holiday from it, get lots of sunlight and exercise, spend time with friends and family, pick up a new hobby or resume an old hobby that gives you some immediate enjoyment in the moment.  It may take months for your habitual thinking patterns to adjust, but once your thinking patterns change you may have a very different perspective on the situation.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

No explanations given. No warnings other than a letter by post mail.  I was in Europe when I realized and could not use my card. Then changing banks is an absolute PITA. Not worth the risk.

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

I have no idea of your living conditions so honest feedback beyond that is quite hard. Different places are different man. I know talented programmers coming from around the world - so your career choice was not wrong. The career has been an opportunity for talent across the globe. It's possible that your life situation, however, is what stops you to actually follow the career path of your choosing now. I know people who've struggled to find direction after their initial education did not pan out. They eventually pull through - sometimes they find a job that is aligned with their education, and sometimes they need to pivot and find something new. I have no idea what action you should take in your local economy. I'm super impressed you take care of you elderly mother. I don't know what relationship you have, but being a caretaker is a dignified position what ever the circumstances. But it can also be a sacrifice towards personal freedoms, goals, and life outcomes. Now, what I'm going to say may sound like BS but it really is the only solid actionable support I can give: take care of yourself. Try to exercise. Try to sleep. Try to eat. Try to find things in life you enjoy, and notice and pay attention to them. Life can be lived - and sometimes needs to be lived - one breath and one heartbeat at a time. reply",

Making a product is not trivial - it's double hard. First you need to come up with a product.

There are success stories, sure, but so many people in the internet are hustling so success looks like driven by chance rather than a deterministic outcome by following a given process.

If you get unemployed, coming up with a product and sales to make a living does not seem deterministic to me in the same sense). reply",

If you are not a cofounder that means you are working on someone else’s dream. There are exceptions of course, some startups pay well and help you build a professional network that can be very valuable when launching your own business. But those are very rare today unless again they are already in the expansion phase with lots of cash in the bank. The absolute best move is to put your ideals on pause and join boring but solid companies with an IPO path in the next 2-3 years, and do that 4-5 times from your 20s to your 30s then cash out and go after your dream without being stressed out about money. This would be my plan if I could go back in time. reply",

You did mention you liked programming, but was that triggered by the glamor and promise? 2. Assuming that it is still to do with computers. A software business does not have to be about building products and selling them. I imagine in Iraq (or where ever you are) there are many small businesses and non-technical people who need their computers maintained and repaired (example, this guy has posted on HN and has a small business that does this : https://www.scottrlarson.com/services/computer/repair/ .. I am not affiliated in any way with him). You might need to hit the street, ignore the fear / embarrassment / rejection, and cold call or cold visit businesses. If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3. Teaching positions may not pay well but may pay the bills while you work to build a career or business. You country was devastated by an illegal war. Rebuilding will take a lot of time and courage.

Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up.

Is moving to an area with more jobs a possibility on the table? Also keep in mind that pay is relative to where you live. While some hit the jackpot making Silicon Valley wages in developing counties with very low costs of living, that’s not the norm and shouldn’t be the expectation. Those wages are high, in part, because the cost of living is high. I work for a large company and pay scales are region dependent to account for cost of living. I think the idea being that two people doing the same job have a relatively similar lifestyle.

          "text": "That’s a great question! Basically  all of the religions make truth claims, and these truth claims are contradictory. For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later. Plus (as does the eastern orthodox) for various reasons it has valid versions of all 7 of the sacraments, especially communion which is kind of the summit of the Christian life. reply",

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward.

Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",

How that information and ability to make a choice are presented to the user is left to the site owner to decide. For site owners, cookie banners are an easy way to comply without having to DESIGN that compliance into their site, which can be interesting but time consuming and expensive. In theory, it should be possible to prompt the user for consent before storing something on their device but that would only work for stuff site owners have control over. In practice, \"cookies\" are rarely used voluntarily by the site owners themselves but they are used a lot by the crap they add to their sites for tracking and so on via tag managers.

          "text": "I don’t use Teamblind as often as I used to, but it played a huge role in my career growth. Coming from a developing country, it helped me level the playing field. Through the platform, I discovered FAANG(current employer for 6yrs now), Leetcode, structured ways to prepare for interviews, and even the fact that sign-on bonuses exist, something I had no idea about before. Teamblind has been so impactful for me that I’m more than happy to pay for it. While there’s certainly noise on the platform, I’ve learned to focus on the insightful conversations and resources that matter. If you are in the US it might not be so useful, but for us outside, it is gold. I've been on HN for way longer than Blind, but Blind had had the most impact in my career & I'm grateful for that. reply",

I follow specific tags like software engineering and career, and I don’t keep notifications on (in fact, the only app with notifications on my phone is WhatsApp). For interviews, I search company-specific tags to find discussions and tips, ChatGPT makes it even easier now to extract insights from those threads. I also use it for compensation research. Occasionally, I’ll check company gossip, and I have to say, Blind has correctly predicted layoffs at my employer twice. Beneath all the noise, some people really do share valuable inside information. That’s why I treat Blind as a data-gathering tool, not a hangout. I mainly open it for interviews, negotiations, compensation benchmarks, or to get the general sentiment around a company. Honestly, I wish they had an API like Reddit’s, it would make pulling insights so much easier. reply",

Since they couldn't change it without risking breaking a customer they were migrating one customer at a time to a classic RDBMS. (There were like 200 customers, each of which is a company you've probably heard of). Many will go \"you need a proper ontology\" at which point just use a RDBMS. Ontologies are an absolute tarpit, as the semantic web showed. The graph illusion is similar to that academic delusion \"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.\" which is one of those quips that makes you appreciate just how theoretical some theoreticians really are. reply",

Most of the time all I need is just a csv-like structure of the data I'm working with and I had a very difficult time with just getting something like that. Joining tables tended to be difficult where the pivot points between relationships was rather semantically unbounded, so it was difficult for me to create a reasonably rigid mental model of the data I was working with. That was especially noticeable in some of the API documentation I worked with -- where a simple REST-like API just gives a simple, usually flat, json... graphql api responses were deeply nested and often in implementation-dependent ways[1] of thousands of lines. Which has IME made explorability practically impossible. GraphQL implementations have consistently felt like a hobby project where implementing it in an API becomes a thing to put on a resume rather than making a functionally useful API.

          "text": "Neo4j has a GraphRAG book that I've found very helpful: https://neo4j.com/essential-graphrag/ It depends on the shape of your data. In my domain (cloud security), there are many many entities and it's very valuable to map out how they relate to each other. For example, we often want to answer a question like: “Which publicly exposed EC2 instances are used by IAM roles that have administrative privileges in my AWS account?” To answer the question, you need to:\n1. Join ec2 instances to security groups to IP rules to IP ranges to find network exposure paths to the open internet.\n2. Join the instances to their instance profiles, to their roles.\n3. Join the IAM roles to their role policies to determine which have admin policies.\n4. Chain all of those joins together, possibly with recursive queries if there are indirect relationships (e.g., role assumption chains). That’s a lot of joins, and the SQL query would get both heavy and hard to maintain. In graph this query looks something like match (i:EC2Instance)--(sg:EC2SecurityGroup)--(r:IPPermissionInbound{action:\"Allow\"})--(rng:IPRange{id:\"0.0.0.0/0\"})\nmatch (i)--(r:AWSRole)--(p:AWSPolicy)--(stmt:AWSPolicyStatement{effect:\"Allow\", resource:\"*\"})\nreturn i.id as instance_id, r.name as role_name To answer this question what internet open compute instances can act as admins in our environment, we needed to traverse multiple objects, but the shape of the answer is pretty simple: just a list of ids and names. Graph databases have quirks and add complexity of their own. If your domain isn't this edge heavy, you're probably better off with Postgres, but for our use-case it's been worth the trade-off imo. reply",

So - we ended up building a simple add/search api that predicts where the data should come from, and what the user needs this week/today and cache it. It's accurate and it's fast. reply",

Maybe they knew something that the team didn't but couldn't articulate it. Maybe it would have been great. Alternately (and this seems to be a common tactic unfortunately), is they don't really know what they are doing but use the strategy of introducing a large / time consuming change and promise incredible things once the change is complete. The longer the change takes, the better in this situation as they can just chill while the change is taking place and polish resume for the next gig if it doesn't work out. If they jump to a new job before failure is obvious they can claim that they affected some large change at previous company and repeat the process. The other strategy is to performtatively claim success in the face of failure and move on to the next big thing. reply",

Doing it right, so that this knowledge can be utilized more efficiently than any RAG, requires sophisticated context engineering, for example to avoid duplicates and keep consistent vocabulary for relationships, but it is totally achievable and the quality of automatically extracted knowledge can be almost spotless, especially if an LLM can also decide on generating parallel embeddings as a semantic search entry point for graph traversal. 2. Writing cypher queries is a job I would never like to have as a human. But LLMs love it, so that an agent can do an ad hoc data science for every single problem. Especially while being aware which criteria were used for graph construction. It is worth ditching things like MCP in favor of tool graph-like solutions. For this purpose I developed my own DSL which only LLM speaks in internally. The effects are mind-blowing. reply",

          "text": "Graph RAG is great, but misunderstood. As a human user, consider file-system navigation or code search. You navigate to a seed file, and then hop through the children and dependencies until you find what you're looking for. The value is in explicit and direct edges. Perfect search is hard. Landing in the right neighborhood is less so. (It's like golf if you think about it) Agentic systems loop through the following steps - (Plan -> Inquire -> Retrieve -> Observe -> Act -> Repeat). The agent interacts with your search-system during the inquire and retrieve phases. In these phrases, There are 2 semantic problems that a simple embedding based search or a simple db alone can't solve: seeding and completeness. Seeding - How do you ask a good question when you don't know what you don't know ? Completeness -  once you know a little bit, how do you know that you have obtained everything you need to answer a question ? A solid embedding based search allows under-defined free-form inquiry, and puts the user near the data they're looking for. From there, an explicit graph allows the agent to navigate through the edges until it hits gold or gives the agent enough signal to retry with better informed free-form inquiry. Together, they solve the seeding problem. Now, once you have found a few seed nodes to work off of, the agent can keep exploring the neighbors, until they become sufficiently irrelevant. At that threshold, the retrieval system can return the explored nodes with a measurable metric of confidence in completeness. This makes completeness a measure that you can optimize, helping solve the 2nd problem. You'll notice that there is no magic here. The quality of your search will depend on the quality of your edges, entities, exploration strategy and relevance detectors. This requires a ton of hand-engineering and subject specific domain knowledge, neither of which are systems bottlenecks. The data-store itself will do very little to help get you a better answer. Which brings me to your question, the datastore. The datastore only matters at sufficient scale. You CAN implement Graph RAG in a standard database. Get a column to track your edges, a column to track entities and some way to search over embeddings and you're good. You can get it done in an afternoon (until permissions become an issue, but I digress). We know that a spotlight style file-system search works just fine on 100k+ documents, while your mac's fan barely even turns on. If you're asking this question, then your company probably doesn't scale past that point. In fact, I'd argue that few companies will ever cross that threshold for agentic operations. At this scale, your postgres instance won't be the bottleneck. Comparing postgres to graph-rag-startups, the real value of using a native graph-RAG solution is their defaults. The companies know that their user's need is agentic semantic search, and the products come preloaded with defaults that give you embeddings, entities and graph-edges that aren't completely useless. From a practical standpoint, those extras might push you over the edge. But be aware that your performance gains are coming from outsourcing the hand-engineering of features and not the data structure itself. My personal opinion is to keep the data structure as simple as possible. MLEs and Data Scientists are mediocre systems engineers and it is okay to accept that. You want your ML & product team to be able to iterate on the search-logic and quality as fast as possible. That's where the real gains will come from. Speaking from experience, premature optimization in a new field will slow your team down to a crawl. IE. Go with postgres if that's what's simple for everyone to work with. tldr: It's not about the scalability of the datastructure, it's about how you use it. reply",

          "text": "My understanding is the big difference is REST must have URLs returned in the API responses to access additional data / actions. So in a REST API you'd have a single URL entrypoint that I'll call \"/root\". \"/root\" might then return to you something like: {\n    \"links\": {\n      \"users\": \"/root/users\",\n      \"posts\": \"/root/posts\",\n      \"mail\": \"/root/mail\"\n    }\n  } So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users\" which would return a list of users along with URLs for how to access individual users. So then the client could make a request for \"/root/users/alice\" and the server would return the information on alice along with URLs for actions like sending her a message or deleting her. But all of that interaction is driven from information returned from the server. All the client needed to begin was just the root URL. Most non-REST JSON APIs today communicate their endpoints via an out-of-band API documentation like swagger. Quoting the Fielding: > A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs > [...] > A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypert... reply",

          "text": "One of the big things too is the encoding of type information using the mechanisms the standard interfaces provide. In HTTP, this is accomplished using media types (through the Accept and Content-Type headers as well as a few related ones). These media types can be standard but they can be vendored too[1]. With something like Content-Type: application/json\n\n   {\n       \"name\": \"\",\n       ...\n   } you don't really know much. With something like example/vnd.mycoolapp.user+json, you get typing information (i.e. you know that the representation of /users/me that the server has given you is a JSON variant of a mycoolapp User. (How the types are known is a priori knowledge of the client (but there are standard link relations you can use to reference API documentation, both human-readable and machine-readable)). A good example of this is your web browser: it knows how to display text/html documents of various character sets, probably knows text/plain, might know application/json. The best part is? HTTP has a standard mechanism for defining these link relations even if what you have isn't necessarily amenable to link relations[2] (the Link header). You can use that to navigate through a collection (previous, item, collection, etc), get documentation about the API (service-doc, service-desc), find things that are related (related), get STUN and TURN information (ice-server), etc. I doubt very much of this is used in practice, but there are a very rich set of standardized relationships that could be used here. (A lot of people admittedly assume \"using PUT in a couple of places\" is doing REST or that not calling all of your method endpoints doAction.pl or whatever is \"RESTful\" and I think that definition has become so widespread that talking about something that approaches actually doing something that resembles the architectural style tends to require reduplication.)

          "text": "One thing I would mention is that COM and CORBA have explicit support for object references, which is a concept that disappeared from later protocols. With these technologies, a server can return a reference to, say, a Person. The client can then do \"person.GetName()\" or similar. The method calls are implemented as \"stubs\" that act as proxies that simply send the RPC along with the references to the objects they operate on. The server-side RPC implementation keeps a mapping between references and actual in-memory objects, so that calls to references call the right thing in the server process. The benefit is that you can work with APIs in ways that feel natural. You can do \"persons.GetPerson(\"123\").GetEmployer().GetEmployees()\" or whatever — everything feels like you're working with in-memory objects. This has drawbacks. One is that the cost of method calls is obscured by this \"referential transparency\", as it's never obvious what is remote or local. Another problem is that the server is required to keep an object around until a client releases it or dies. If the client dies without first releasing, the objects will live until a keepalive timer triggers. But because a malformed client can keep objects around, the system is vulnerable to high memory use (and abuse). In the end you'd often end up holding a whole graph of objects, and nothing would be released until all references were released. Leak can be difficult to find. My knowledge of COM/CORBA may be incomplete, but never understood why the server couldn't implement these in terms of \"locators\". For example, if a server has a \"GetPerson(string id) -> Person\" type method, rather than sending an object reference that points to an in-memory person object, it could return a lightweight, opaque string like \"person:123\". Any time the client's internal proxy passed this back to the server, the server could look it up; the glue needed to resolve these identifiers back into real objects would be a little more work on the part of the developer, but it would sidestep the whole need to keep objects around. And they could cached quite easily. Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. However, it does this in a pretty different way with different pros and cons. [1] https://blog.cloudflare.com/capnweb-javascript-rpc-library/ reply",

          "text": "> Cap'n Web [1] is the first RPC system in a long time (as far as I know) that implements object references. Cap'n Proto does it too, and has been around since 2013. We use it extensively it the implementation of Cloudflare Workers. Many people have joined the team, initially thought \"what is this weird thing? Why don't we just use gRPC instead?\", and then after a few months of using it decided it's actually a superpower. I'm planning to write more about this on the Cloudflare blog in the next couple months, probably. (Cap'n Proto is itself based on CapTP, the protocol used in the E programming language.) I never actually used COM nor CORBA, but my impression is there's a few reasons they didn't work where Cap'n Proto does: 1. Excessive complexity. CORBA is a monstrously large standard, covering not just protocol but also system architecture (\"Object Resource Brokers\"). 2. Lack of asynchronous programming. CORBA calls would synchronously block the calling thread until the call completed. But when making calls over a network (rather than locally), it's much more important that you be able to do other things while you wait. CORBA added (extremely complex) asynchronous I/O support late in its life but few people ever used it. 3. Lack of promise pipelining. This sort of follows from #2 (at least, I don't know how you'd express promise pipelining if you don't have promises to start with). Without promise pipelining, it's incredibly hard to design composable interfaces, because they cannot be composed without adding a round trip for every call. So instead you end up pushed towards big batch requests, but those don't play well with object-oriented API design. 4. Poor lifecycle management. An object reference in CORBA was (I am told) \"just data\", which could be copied anywhere and then used. The server had no real way of being notified when the object reference was no longer needed, unless clients proactively told it so (but this was up to the app). Cap'n Proto ties object lifetime to connections, so when a connection is lost, all the object references held across it are automatically disposed. Cap'n Proto's client libraries are also designed to carefully track the lifecycle of a reference within the client app, so that as soon as it goes out-of-scope (GC'd, destructor runs, etc.), a message can be sent to the server letting it know. This works pretty well. 5. Bad security model. All objects existed in a global namespace and any client could connect to any object. Access control lists had to be maintained to decide which clients were allowed access to which objects. This is a bolted-on security mechanism that sounds simple but in practice is extremely tedious and error-prone, and often people would avoid it by implementing coarse-grained security models. Cap'n Proto implements an object-capability model, aka capability-based security. There is no global namespace of objects. To access one, you have to first receive an object reference from someone who already has one. Passing someone an object reference implies giving them permission to use it. This may at first sound more complicated, but in practice it turns out to map very cleanly to common object-oriented API design patterns. As a result of all this, in Cap'n Proto (and Cap'n Web), you can pretty much use the exact same API design patterns you'd use in a modern programming language, with lots of composable objects and methods, and it's all safe and efficient.

          "text": "SOAP was actually pretty easy to use, once it settled out. For the most part, everyone used some kind of SDK that translated WSDL (Web Services Description Language) specifications to their chosen language. So you could define almost any function - like PostBlog(Blog blog), and then publish it as a WSDL interface to be consumed by a client. We could have a Java server, with a C# client, and it more or less just worked. We used it with things like signatures, so the data in the message wasn't tampered with. Why did it stop getting popular? It probably really started to fall out of favor when Java/C# stopped being some of the more popular programming languages for web development, and PHP and Ruby got a lot more momentum. The idea was that REST/JSON interfaces would be easier to understand, as we would have a hypermedia interface. There was sort of an attempt to make a RESTy interface work with XML, called WebDAV, that Microsoft Office supported for a while, but it was pretty hard to work with.

The second problem is that XML technologies were too smart. Most developers aren’t that smart and had absolutely no imagination necessary to implement any of this amazing smartness. JSON kind of, but not really, killed XML. It’s like how people believe Netflix killed Blockbuster. Blockbuster died because of financial failures due to too rapid late stage expansion and format conversion. Netflix would have killed Blockbuster later had Blockbuster not killed itself first. JSON and XML are kind of like that. JSON allowed for nested data structures but JSON tried to be smart. To the contrary JSON tried to be as dumb as possible, not as dumb as CSV, but pretty close. What amazes me in all of this is that people are still using HTTP for so much data interchange like it’s still the late 90s. Yeah, I understand it’s ubiquitous and sessionless but after that it’s all downhill and extremely fragile for any kind of wholesale large data replication or it costs too much at the thread level for massively parallel operations. reply",

I am helping my friend by working at his stealth AI startup company. Previously, I worked at Amazon. I started software engineering to solve real-world problems with software, and that is what keeps me on my way. I define what the problem is, understand why to solve it, design how to solve it with code, write code to do that, evaluate the result after writing code, and repeat the cycle. I am a result-driven developer. Writing code itself does not give me dopamine, meaning that I don’t add features that the end-users do not care about. I am looking for where there is a lot to do, solving real-world problems, a hunger to learn exists, and everyone is collaborative and fun to work with. reply",

In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I am looking for my break to get into the contemporary software development scene, after having previously developed software (primarily Windows utilities) on my own and having dabbled in various technologies.  This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team.  An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development.  It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it! reply",

Pequity – pequity.com - Compensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations. Built V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com - Security and compliance training integrated with workplace tools. Developed a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app - App facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet. Used Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

While my core competency is frontend and the React ecosystem, I can navigate the full stack confidently and contribute to most any codebase.  I've worked on products sitting atop PHP, C#/.NET, Python, Rails and Node. The bulk of my experience is in startups (B2C, B2B & SaaS), though I am open to any organization that provides a strong culture fit.  In my experience, culture and team dynamics far outways what is being built - or the tech that is being used.  I am growth oriented and passionate about working collaboratively, cross-functionally, and making a meaningful impact in people's lives with what is built. I'm also unafraid of legacy code or tech debt. Note: My current role and location is in St Thomas, USVI.  After my last startup role, my family and I decided to try something new and see if life in the Virgin Islands could work for us.  In short, it did not.  My family is already in WA, and I am here finishing up my role as IT Coordinator.  I will be joining my family in WA at the end of November. reply",

I have worked with many startups, long-standing corporations, governments, many name brands (in which I'm sure you've even interacted with my work multiple times and wouldn't know it), and have had my own businesses in this field. I have single handily built applications seen by millions of public users and I would absolutely bet you are one of them. I began freelancing in high-school in the late 90s. I didn't learn development from a bootcamp, I was obsessed at an early age and understood the fundamentals of JavaScript well before front-end frameworks were a thing yet my experience with React, Vue, SolidJS, and many others has been the forefront of my work for the past 13 years or so (not SolidJS obviously). I know this market isn't great on both sides, and you could absolutely hire someone outside the US for cheaper (my rate is 65/hr negotiable btw), but you would definitely not get the same experience or outcome for your project.

The only real problem is that the lenses can get sweaty or foggy and all of a sudden I go from punching faces and dodging fists to punching at blurs and failing to dodge other blurs. Maybe instead of a quest you just display video to a screen? When I was using a hotel fitness center they had a peloton and that seems to be something you can do with those. It was a couple years back and I recall the video being loosely if at all tied to the speed you pedal at, but it was more fun than just looking at a wall while I pretend to go somewhere. reply",

          "text": "maybe html can do all of these and it will only cost me the time it takes to build the app, but right now PDF does all of those things for me, here today in my pocket, for $15. Which is nice. I'd love to see a text to speech engine that pronounces formatting but I think it might be more complicated than learning to pronounce something boldly. Am I yelling? Am I keeping my voice low but adding intensity? Can you automate answering that question in a way that's mostly correct most of the time? If something is in italics am I whispering, stage whispering, emphasizing or merely saying the title of an existing work out loud? It's a fundamental abuse of a text formatting engine to try to use it for speech formatting, you either have to use the existing tags for things they were never intended for or you have to start adding tags like <slywhisper> and <scream emotion=\"angry\"> vs <scream emotion=\"excited\">. That being said, an html-independent form of emotional text annotation might actually be a good idea as the inevitability of synthesized human voices being a part of our daily lives takes hold. I find PDFs easier to organize than HTML because HTML is any number of files referencing each other across a directory structure that can have any size or shape, and a PDF is a single file. If I'm searching my library for Bob Wilson, I want his books to show up and I want them to have his picture in them if that's how the book was published but I don't want Bob_Wilson.jpeg to show up as a result. I could automate print to PDF from html or use the tool someone else posted in order to condense my saved HTMLs to single files but that's more processing time and effort in order to get what I already have from a PDF Syncing position across HTML files may be doable, but syncing position across PDFs is done. You're absolutely right that that has nothing to do with the format but the (implied) question I was answering when I brought it up was why I would sometimes want one and other times want the other. That's why. Finally, and probably the only one that really matters inasmuch as all the other reasons can be coded around but this one cant: the places I get documents distribute them in PDF, mobi and epub but almost never in HTML reply",

It works like \"put these couple words at position x,y\" and not (html's) semantic \"here comes a heading\" tag that helps people accessibly read your text, and if you're not suffering from any impairment or mobile devices with narrower screens than this particular render was designed for, it also lets you work with the document more easily. It's like you remove all HTML and keep only the CSS: all definitions of what's a section, sentence, emphasis, or caption are gone I didn't mean literally an image, hence saying image-like.

It's also much more readable on different screen sizes, as the user can resize the window to whatever is comfortable on a 27\" screen, or fits on their pocket e-reader. You can even draw it on a canvas if you want to prevent people from extracting the decrypted strings (though it's evil, you have that option). There's only benefits! PDF is the lazy way to half-ass a read-only document while screwing, ahem, making anyone using a mobile phone zoom, pan, and squint.

          "text": "Shortcutting much of the discussion here (what are you goals / why would  you do that / don't use  format X):  a key problem is that neither HTML (as published on today's Web) nor PDF are reliable as canonical document formats.  Tagged-markup such as Markdown (or otherlightweight markup languages) or LaTeX (or other heavy markup languages) are far more robust.  Markdown has its variants, but all are pretty simple and easy to produce.  LaTeX is slightly more complex, but remains quite straightforward for simple works. Once you've got an appropriate canonical version in any of these options , you have an embarassment of riches to convert to any given document format (what I call endpoints) you'd care for:   PDF, HTML, RTF, DOCX, or many, many others.  I generally reach for Pandoc first, which itself, yes, of course, often relies on additional tools/libraries to parse or generate endpoints, but is quite versatile. You can simplify the intake of HTML by stripping out cruft.  Readability, Beautiful Soup, or other HTML filtering tools can target the core content and metadata you most likely want. Otherwise, think through what you're doing and why to more narrowly define your goals and tools.  E.g., if you want a faithful printed representation of a mainstream-browser-rendered page (that is, Google Chrome), you'd probably do best to use its print-to-PDF options (mentioned several times here).  If you want to extract core text, filtering out much of today's WWW cruft will be a high priority. reply",

If you have the original document (in Markdown), one possibility would be to use my software, KeenWrite[1], to convert Markdown to XHTML then typeset XHTML to PDF via ConTeXt. See the user manual[2] for an example of a Markdown document typeset in this fashion, along with usage instructions. If you only have HTML to work with, you can also use Flying Saucer[3], which is what KeenWrite uses to preview Markdown documents when rendered as HTML. Flying Saucer uses an open-source version of iText[4] to produce PDF documents (from HTML source docs). Another possibility is to use pandoc and LaTeX.

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their \"safe\" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe. This seemed like a solvable problem. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about. Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do. The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner. Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public. So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!) You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet). It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut. The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically \"just works\" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October. reply",

          "text": "Thanks, buddy!  I'm having fun.  There are a few sides to it.  There are the actual physical surgical tools that you have to design, test, and manufacture.  Then there's the robot that adjusts those tools.  That stuff is a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  The camera is a big deal and it's a ton of work to get that right.  Then of course you have all the software, which is a slew of computer vision models that operate on a local computer in a careful dance of resource orchestration.  The software has a lot: UI, grpc services, ml models on containers, inverse kinematics for calculating robot position, hardware interfaces, etc.  Then there's a bunch of regulatory, validation, compliance, etc. To answer your question about expertise, it really depends on what you are interested in.  We have some dedicated mechanical engineers with medical device experience.  The software is handled by a few computer vision and full stack folks.  So there's different skillsets. I'm a bit of a journeyman and as a result, I am decent across all of it.  I always did software and went where the wind blew.  It's been 20-something years since I graduated so I've seen a lot.  About 10 years ago I got a job I was totally unqualified for, which was R&D for a company that made lab equipment for testing gas and oil.  I was solo and had to learn all the mechatronics stuff - CAD, microcontrollers, electronics, etc.  Check out this video: https://youtu.be/MA6hnyXx4p4 .  That specific experience allows me to be the glue in our engineering org. To work here, you don't need medical experience.  We have plenty of that.  One of the cool things about engineering, especially software engineering, is that you can float around between verticals.  I've learned all about media, finance, petroleum, insurance, waste disposal, etc.  The skills translate.  If you are purely software, I recommend picking up an Arduino and some motors and building something like a simple pan/tilt mechanism with an accompanying mobile app.  Just do it.  It might inspire you.  I think curiosity and enthusiasm are the most valuable traits one can have. reply",

Doctors, like most people, don't like stuff on their head.  Plus in ortho there is a lot of feel to it.  It's often referred to as \"carpentry\".  The docs I know, especially those with experience, would prefer a video and a cadaver lab.  Even that's a lot to ask because they are so swamped.

I'm running a similar but smaller project (5k MAU), my oldest map is central London in 1561 https://onamap.me/maps/London1561/ I got into it because I was interested in the technical challenge of registering GPS to maps which are very warped compared to reality, like very old maps or illustrated tourist maps. My home page is here for more: https://onamap.me/ I also came across this similar project a while ago: https://www.verbeeld.be/2024/11/17/using-gps-in-the-year-156...

          "text": "I’m working on an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups. Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario). While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking. I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica. I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them. [1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more. reply",

We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible. Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow). Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com .

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We’re especially keen to talk to Staff Engineers (backend) and Senior AI Engineers (e.g. LLMs and the scaffolding around, computer-use agents) Even if we don’t have a role out  your specific skill set, we’d love to talk!

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want. We're getting big enough to start splitting into more focused teams and there's a few different areas that we need; our infra needs a lot of work, we have big dreams for some cool AI agent/pipeline work and there's still a lot of more fundamental phone system specific problems we need to solve. We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!

Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving:\nTracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports. Why it matters:\nThis infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance. The role:\nWe’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack: Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing.

          "text": "I worked here for a few months several years ago - justifiably let go for non-performance, it was a strange time in my life and I had a lot of distractions, it was an amicable separation. While they expect consistent high performance, the bar is reasonable and the hours can be a bit long for some but aren't insane. Everyone at the company is smart and driven. Both founders are highly technical, very passionate, genuinely business-savvy, and great with customers. Abe Erdos is borderline polymath genius - topics like wavelet decomposition are relatively pedestrian to Abe, and he seems equally comfortable in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science (all of which are critical to this business). Abe's also a good listener, it's easy to underestimate him and difficult to overestimate him. Ken Miller has more energy than anyone I've ever seen, a very broad and reasonably deep understanding of pretty much everything, and generally has strong opinions - if you want to challenge his roadmap, it's best to stay one step ahead of him and show rather than tell. It's a fairly mature product, but the business still moves at a much faster pace than the rest of their industry and they constantly innovate. They stay on top of technological changes; they rarely take more than a year to adopt something new that is applicable to their products. Has the feeling of a \"very stable start-up\". They truly own both the hardware and data end-to-end, which is very helpful. They have expertise and ownership of every level of abstraction - they'll build Helmholtz coils in-house to calibrate instruments on custom PCBs designed and soldered in-house, while managing distributed systems from edge to datacenter, run their products at customer sites, maintain personal relationships with their customers and employees, and deal with legal action directly themselves. If you're interested - understand that what might take 1-3 months at a large corporation is often accomplished in a few days to a week here. Working, manipulable demos are appreciated over presentations. If discussion hits a wall where it's impossible to know whether going direction A or B is correct, they will simply pick one direction to explore rather than deliberate further and they'll use that exploration to gain more information, open to backtracking and going the other direction, but only if it's profitable to do so. Every person there has built a lot, either product or business. They focus on building things that don't suck, and they don't have much patience for things that do. So generally you won't have to worry about being forced to use crappy tools that make you miserable. There are a LOT of different personalities in the company, all strong in their own ways (some quiet, some loud, some blunt) so it's probably best if you are the type of person who can work with a variety of personalities - but this isn't a euphemism to indicate toxic personalities - if you're high energy and passionate you'll feel at home, sometimes opinions can fly fast and hot but the best results are gained by communicating clearly and decisively, not emotionally. Some employees are quieter and it's often best to be quieter with them and listen more. Keeping an emotional buffer/distance between you and work decisions made by your colleagues/bosses will help a lot. If there's loud direct criticism, it's about the work - not the person. Most of their employees are on-location, but they integrate remote workers well enough - quite a few excellent employees work remotely and communication is good. You might miss some in-person chatter but you won't be completely blindsided (at least not much more than anyone else in a company that makes decisions faster than you can complete a story point). When I was there, compensation was definitely reasonable - I was comfortable. It's an MCOL, but we had a competent developer in NY who stayed with the company through the tech boom years. reply",

In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes. Job postings and more on information about our team and culture are available at: https://jobs.narrative.io/ Apply by sending your resume to hiring-dev@narrative.io. reply",

Subsequently, I can't recover my GitHub account.<p>I have recovered most of my digital assets by proving I am me.  Recovering my GitHub has proven to be more painful than Google's treatment regarding my Google Workspace.<p>I have the original phone number associated with my account, and can verify a bunch of private repos that are associated with my account—even the number of commits on one of them (almost 6900). I can't, however, provide any 2FA codes or backup codes because they are printed on paper that has, I assume, been destroyed.<p>I maintain two relatively popular Ruby packages that have gone stale since I've been gone, and there are projects my GitHub there that I was working on prior to my incarceration—including a SaaS I had hoped to launch post-prison and two books I was ready to publish. Having said, just opening another account isn't exactly the option I want to take.<p>I've opened a ticket, but I'm getting the \"shit out of luck because we don't know you are you\" treatment. I understand that security is important, but if one can prove they are them, what's the point?<p>Are there other avenues I have that I haven't explored yet?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

The situation you are in is very unfortunate and I am sympathetic but in GitHub's defence, this is exactly what I hope would happen when I enable 2FA. I would be very perturbed to find out that GitHub would grant access to my account given identity documents. There are some creative solutions (e.g: a countdown to the reset with progressively more aggressive email notifications to ensure the account holder is aware) but even they are problematic.

If I lose access to my main identity document, one advantage of government ID is that I’ll urgently have it reissued. In most of the places I’ve lived, that’s the kind of thing you can validate against either the underlying authority or a sleazy-but-reasonably-accurate data broker. But in either case it’s out-of-band from my relationship with the tech company, in a way they can validate by semi- or fully-automated means, and with reference to an independent authority. If somebody wants to physically mug me to steal my ID for access to my GitHub, I figure I’m pretty much out of luck—to paraphrase James Mickens [0], Mossad’s gonna Mossad.

          "text": "I’m not sure that blaming tech support for not understanding context is the best approach here. The other sides of that context, which are  understandable from their point of view, is that you were charged with some serious crimes. There’s a large delta between the charges and the conviction, but you’ve got some scary words written about you online. Secondarily, GitHub has policy so whereas you’re coming at it from a position of being correct, they’re in a position where they have to break policy. That’s a big risk. Your best bet would likely be legal. US Federal law imposes some strict rules on lawyers for identity verification to combat money laundering so attorneys have a legally recognized toolkit to verify identity. Having a third party who works for you in the mix could help. Though again, it would involve breaking their policy so this would be a decision made several layers above Zendesk access. Otherwise, I think this is doing precisely what 2FA is meant to do. It’s not okay for you and you’ve clearly lost a lot because of this, but with the current threat environment, GitHub has to be very careful especially with 2FA. From their point of view, there likely isn’t that big of a gap between your interactions and interactions with people who are trying to take over accounts. A lawyer may not work, but it sure changes that equation. reply",

I tried the normal means (support tickets etc) to no avail. The third or fourth time I got someone in account recovery. There was a very formal process for verifying my identity (I'm sure based on the process this happens all the time). Eventually I they helped me recover my account. It probably took a few months on the whole, but once I got the right support rep it was only a week or so. So my advice would be to submit more tickets. Because they might have a process that not all support agents know about, and some are more helpful than others. reply",

          "text": "Thoughts of the top of my head: - If the most important thing is control of the Ruby gems, reach out to RubyGems.org support - for your projects, if you have are past collaborators on those repos, they can sometimes open GH tickets referencing the project and vouch for you. Doesn't guarantee success, but adds weight - GH (being part of MSFT) does have some channels for escalated identity verification. Lawyers or notarized ID may be needed...possibly expensive, but sometimes the only way GH support is extremely strict on account recovery once 2FA/backup codes are gone. I wish you luck! reply",

For small and medium robotics companies, this can really slow down iteration.<p>I’m trying to understand:<p>• How do you/your team currently manage and analyze robot data?<p>• What are the biggest pain points you face (e.g. debugging failures, comparing test runs, searching across logs)?<p>• Have you tried tools like Foxglove/Rerun/etc.? What works, what doesn’t?<p>• If there was a solution that actually made this easier, what would it have to do for you to adopt it?<p>I also put together a short (5 min) survey here: https://forms.gle/x57UReg8Yj9Gx7qZ8<p>If you’re willing to share your experiences in more detail, it would really help shape what we’re building.<p>We’ll anonymize responses and share the aggregated insights back with the community once we’ve collected enough.<p>Thanks in advance — I know this is a niche problem, but I figured HN has some of the sharpest robotics engineers, founders, and tinkerers out there. Really curious to hear how you’re solving this today.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Full disclosure, I work at Foxglove right now. Before joining, I spent over seven years consulting and had more than 50 clients during that period. Here are some thoughts: * Combing through the syslogs to find issues is an absolute nightmare, even more so if you are told that the machine broke at some point last night * Even if you find the error, it's not necessarily when something broke; it could have happened way before, but you just discovered it because the system hit a state that required it * If combing through syslog is hard, try rummaging through multiple mcap files by hand to see where a fault happened * The hardware failing silently is a big PITA - this is especially true for things that read analog signals (think PLCs) Many of the above issues can be solved with the right architecture or tooling, but often the teams I joined didn't have it, and lacked the capacity to develop it. At Foxglove, we make it easy to aggregate and visualize the data and have some helper features (e.g., events, data loaders) that can speed up workflows. However, I would say that having good architecture, procedures, and an aligned team goes a long way in smoothing out troubleshooting, regardless of the tools. reply",

          "text": "Jennifer Senior wrote a great piece back in 2006 about burnout [1] titled \"Can’t Get No Satisfaction\". It's worth reading the whole thing. Here are some fragments that stuck with me: > we think of burnout as the gap between expectations and rewards > happiness equals reality divided by expectations > level of caring couldn’t be sustained in the absence of results How have you been framing your side project? Is your side project intended to be a business? If so, what outputs is the business achieving (revenue, profit, your effective hourly wage as the owner operator)?  Dispassionately, is it doing well enough commercially that it makes sense to continue to pursue this business? In the case where this side project has not been achieving sufficient commercial results, and has been falling short of your expectations and the goals you set yourself, is it possible that your resistance to continuing working on the side project is because subconsciously your body has decided it is not a good use of additional time and energy? It could be beneficial and healthy if you could give yourself a long break from thinking and focusing on your side project, to get your brain out of this habit of focusing on the side project and give it the opportunity to think and focus on some new things, or just to rest. From my experience (not with side projects but with job related burnout)  consider taking a holiday from it, get lots of sunlight and exercise, spend time with friends and family, pick up a new hobby or resume an old hobby that gives you some immediate enjoyment in the moment.  It may take months for your habitual thinking patterns to adjust, but once your thinking patterns change you may have a very different perspective on the situation.

          "text": "Software hiring is chaotic and immature to the extreme. As a former JavaScript developer most employers have absolutely no idea what they want in a candidate. It’s a constant tug of war between competency, social compatibility, and ease of replacement. The result is a technically unqualified candidate barely mature enough to put text on screen in very narrow constraints and yet immature enough to believe it’s a form of mastery shaped by a decade of careful molding. In most cases the evaluation process is a series of basic literacy tests, code fashion assessments, and homework that exists more for testing gullibility than technical achievement. In other industries it’s simple as there is only licensing, broker/agent model, or both. Everything else is a secondary evaluation of prior achievement and personality. I suspect the real reasons software fails to adapt to any kind of industry standard is because software does not want to accept liability for its products and because it wants maximum freedom to hire/fire candidates of its choosing irrespective of costs. reply",

          "text": "I've hired many people for science and automation software positions at small and large US biotechs. We usually did a phone screen (both technical and HR), then an on-site interview. The overall process wasn't much different for Ph.D. vs. Bachelors/Masters, but of course we asked very different questions depending on the level. Ph.D.-level positions were usually required to give a brief talk (partly to probe their communication skills.) For certain specific software automation positions, we did end up giving a coding test during the on-site interview. But no homework or multi-round stuff. The present situation in software is mostly the result of an oversupply of labor. Companies are endlessly picky because they can be. I am old enough to remember other recessions where companies could make ridiculous demands (once had a company demand I come in early Sunday morning for an interview, just to make sure I was truly committed to working 24/7. No thanks!) Recessions eventually end, although not always in a way that helps specific careers. Good luck! reply",

I can usually go from initial meeting to offer in 10 days or less if it works for the candidate’s schedule. I also don’t post jobs and solicit applications, I do outreach only.

I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I don't know whether it's a common question you have from prospective employers, but if I'm running a business (FWIW, I'm not), I'd be worried that regularly sending money to Iraq might trigger some alarms (anti-money laundering, sanctions, etc.), and this probably trumps any other consideration unless somehow you're able to show that you're so good at doing the work that it's worth the (perceived) risk. So I'm speculating that maybe you'd have better chances if you focus on crypto-friendly companies and figure out a way to receive money using crypto, and mention this upfront or at least at the same time you reveal where you are currently. reply",

          "text": "You could try software consulting agencies like Toptal. However, international freelance work as a junior dev is probably an uphill battle (especially since experienced local developers are having troubles finding work). If there's nothing local to you, and you cannot move, the only options that I see are software-adjacent jobs in other industries. IT would be an obvious choice. But even outside of IT you might be able to be able to write internal tools and ooch into a de facto software position that way. Try exploring work in another area that interests you, and look for things that are repetitive, annoying, or error-prone. Those are things that are possible candidates for tools, or also possible entrepreneurial opportunities. I also found Erwin McManus' approach to finding what you like do helpful. Take a sheet of paper and make to columns: \"I love this!\", \"I really dislike this\". Over the course of a couple weeks, when you're feeling one of those, write what you are doing in the appropriate column. You'll get start seeing some patterns after a while. His theory is that what we excites us is pretty specific, so look for things like \"writing tools for others\" rather than \"programming\". (However, while I think he's right, I also think we are much broader than that, so you might look for things that are not even related to programming. You might find something completely unexpected that does have local opportunities.) reply",

          "text": "\"you can simply sell a product.\" Are you personally making a living by selling a product or service you created - and if so could you share something of your experience? Making a product is not trivial - it's double hard. First you need to come up with a product. Then you need to sell it and the latter is possibly much harder than the technology in all except the most complex of products. There are success stories, sure, but so many people in the internet are hustling so success looks like driven by chance rather than a deterministic outcome by following a given process. (If you get to medical school, then becoming a doctor is a deterministic outcome. If you get unemployed, coming up with a product and sales to make a living does not seem deterministic to me in the same sense). reply",

But those are very rare today unless again they are already in the expansion phase with lots of cash in the bank. The absolute best move is to put your ideals on pause and join boring but solid companies with an IPO path in the next 2-3 years, and do that 4-5 times from your 20s to your 30s then cash out and go after your dream without being stressed out about money.

If only 1% of the people are going to turn into customers, get the other 99% out of the way, faster the better. 3.

What adversity does is challenge our attachment profile. This helps the timid hoarder, who wants to keep everything, by forcing them to choose. They learn a stronger, purer, sense of self in the process. A lesson we can’t seem to learn as fast, voluntarily. Victor Frankl describes it in great detail as a holocaust survivor in Man’s Search For Meaning. So embrace your hardship. Consider that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, to move ahead. And make all attachments second to this - Never Give Up. But for the rest, maybe introduce flexibility, experiment more. You have an opinion on these other opportunities not being worth it, but what have you tried?

Is moving to an area with more jobs a possibility on the table? Also keep in mind that pay is relative to where you live. While some hit the jackpot making Silicon Valley wages in developing counties with very low costs of living, that’s not the norm and shouldn’t be the expectation. Those wages are high, in part, because the cost of living is high. I work for a large company and pay scales are region dependent to account for cost of living.

For example christianity says that there is one God and that Jesus is the son of God, fully human and fully divine. Every other religion makes truth claims as well. So we can kind of look at this in a patronizing way and say the truth claims don’t matter, just the effect of believing in them matters, which is kind of the modern approach, but obviously you are not seriously engaging with the beliefs at that point. So I would say that christianity has the most logical, comprehensive and historically/experientially validated truth claims. As to why catholicism specifically its the church Jesus, ie God himself, founded. All the other christian denominations were founded by men hundreds or thousands of years later.

          "text": "The Trinity consists of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Philosophically we are able to understand that God must exist without even requiring theological revelation. And we are actually able to derive that the Trinity must exist too. The Father, the first person of God (who is pure actualization) would have a thought of Himself and the thought would be so perfect and complete that it would be actualized into the second person of the Trinity, the Son. Then the Son and the Father love eachother and make such a perfect gift of themselves to eachother that this combined gift of love becomes a third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. So once a God exists as philosophically He must, we also can reason He must exist as a Trinity although the thought might not occur to us without theological revelation. Catholicism is Judaism! It is the continuation and fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith. Catholicism is correct because Jesus founded a church with the 12 apostles as the first bishops and the succession of bishops from the 12 apostles has never been broken in the catholic church. Normal people like Martin Luther or Calvin or Joseph Smith do not have the authority to start valid religions on their own especially since Jesus (who is God) has already created the religion He wants us to follow and has been very clear that it is the way God wants us to worship Him. People inevitably will reject the call to be obedient to God because of pride and various other influences. If you read the New Testament Jesus predicts that many people will reject the church as many people rejected Him. The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years who have devoted their lives to thinking about and answering any questions you might have in much greater detail than I can certainly. The saints are the most inspirational role models I can imagine, learning about them is a joy. And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Unfortunately I don’t know if all of this stuff is even on the radar of people in the tech sphere so I hope some people have their curiousity sparked and learn more! It’s a fun hobby even if you are just interested in diving deeper into history. reply",

The Old Testament and the many, many very specific Jewish prophecies of Jesus that are fulfilled in the New Testament are part of the Catholic faith.

This is just your opinion: I'm sure Jesus was a remarkable character, but I don't see how it's clear that he was god. From my point of view he was just a normal person and didn't have the authority to start a valid religion. > The church is very intellectually rich. If you engage with it in good faith and an open mind you have the smartest people of the past two thousand years Respectfully disagree with both. The smartest people I know have figured out it's nonsense. > And I can’t emphasize enough, the fruits of engaging with the church in good faith and asking God to help you are very, very real and literally the antidote to 99% of the problems that modern people are suffering from. Here I think I can agree with you that the church is an antidote to 99% of the problems modern people are suffering from. Though I think there are other ways too.

          "text": "I'm sorry to tell you this but the illusion you have that because you're college educated or can program that you are entitled to a larger than average income is misguided. You can get a job at Walmart, Target, or a grocery store. It is disgusting that educated people no longer have institutions to live and work in but this is the culmination of 50 years of neoliberal assault on occidental values. The social mobility boat set sail a long time ago. It isn't just coders-- it's teachers, philosophers, poets and novelists, musicians (...) it's all parts of society that think and feel for a living. You can't have that in a socially held back, illiterate society even if just for the envy it creates in regular people. (see, \"Populism\" for more) Liberal autocracy is taking the color out of life. You might watch a few episodes of, \"I Love Lucy\" to get a fix on what living in black and white is like. Pleasantville comes to mind. Our lives will be the plot of that film backward. EDIT: I didn't realize that our guy here is in Iraq. With that said I will leave the original post so a bunch of overpaid software developers can tell me how misguided and angsty I am. reply",

          "text": "There was a time I was thinking in similar vibes, but came to realization this is actually oversimplification. 1. if there are jobs offering high pay, and there are people who get them- these jobs are not overpaid, clearly some people want to pay high and there are other people who deliver (and of course there are other who fake it, but it's not a norm) 2. not all people are equal, and not all jobs are equal, and just because 'it feels unfair' does not mean it is unfair. Sure, there are different levels of programmers but I personally have seen people who deserve every penny of their pay, because they produce stuff 99.99% people won't be able to produce no matter how hard they want to be in that league 3. Education is investment people make because they see it opens some doors that are otherwise closed- looking at job descriptions in my area, most well paid jobs require some form of paper from applicants- it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's state of reality (and sure, there are other jobs where paper is not needed, my point is that with the paper more doors are opened) 4. in case of original poster, the problem might be different- partially because of the target audience and partially because of local reality. In early stage of developed countries nepothism is a huge problem, so I sympathetise with the poster as I know this first hand. I dare to say, having college degree puts him in much better situation than most of the population and the game is to be patient. reply",
