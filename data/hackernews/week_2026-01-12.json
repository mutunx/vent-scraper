          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret. - OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly. OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch. Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

We built it after working in the industry and seeing families struggle a lot with navigating the complex aged care system (at a time in their lives which is already very stressful). It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these. Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey. The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective). One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db. reply",

We’re taking a local-first approach with electric as a sync engine. All interactions against our own apis are instant with optimistic updates. Making the app feel more like a native app rather than the typical web app. Taking this approach has lead to some interesting challenges, both in technical and product areas. Some features requires third party roundtrips (summaries, labelling, embedding etc..) which breaks the \"instant\" system. We’re experimenting with ways to design those flows so the system still feels fast. Currently we only have one \"loading\" request in the entire system. Having all data available on the client has also lead to some neat benefits. No need to compose or build your typical GET endpoints in the API. You just query the client DB directly!

The way I see it is that I can just text my assistant bot and ask it something like \"hey, can you research which NAS setup would be the best for me given x and y\". It will offer some setup and I would say \"can you add it to the plan\" and \"can you plan the next steps for me?\". The bot will also update the knowledgebase and version control it. You might also want to use it for something like planning a trip to Paris, where at some point you might say \"hey, given my schedule, can you squeeze a tour to top5 croissant places in the center of Paris\". The whole thing sound really vague and sounds like something solved long ago, but I cannot find solutions that will be guaranteed to stick to a very precise plan that I can review at any given moment.

          "text": "VersionAlert: https://versionalert.com For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get. It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful. https://riffradar.org/ reply",

Things like manually reconciling data between billing, support, and ops, or preparing the same reports in slightly different formats for different stakeholders. These processes usually start small and “temporary,” but scale quietly as the company grows. The trade-off is that they’re hard to automate cleanly because ownership isn’t always clear. Curious whether the pain you’re seeing is more about fragmented data or about human approval loops that automation alone doesn’t fully eliminate? reply",

In some large businesses I've worked in, so many people have been hired that some systems and processes have wound up being controlled by entirely different people from the people who need them. So coordination between people and waiting for people who have little to no incentive to do the thing they're being asked to takes up a large part of the working day. 2. In other businesses, a large fraction, or even a large majority of the employees have had no discernible job except to talk and write about the job performed by the few people doing an actual job. So a lot of time in these businesses would be spent dodging meeting invitations, rejecting grand ideas about revolutionizing the business with AI on the blockchain, saying no to \"if you could X, that'd be great\" and generally reminding people that they're not in charge. The great thing about these problems is that you're not very likely to have them in a small startup, but if you decide to grow the organization later, you'll need to be very vigilant about how you scale. reply",

          "text": "I recently wrote a command-line full-text search engine [1].  I needed to implement an inverted index.  I choose what seems like the \"dumb\" solution at first glance: a trie (prefix tree). There are \"smarter\" solutions like radix tries, hash tables, or even skip lists, but for any design choice, you also have to examine the tradeoffs.  A goal of my project is to make the code simpler to understand and less of a black box, so a simpler data structure made sense, especially since other design choices would not have been all that much faster or use that much less memory for this application. I guess the moral of the story is to just examine all your options during the design stage.  Machine learning solutions are just that, another tool in the toolbox.  If another simpler and often cheaper solution gets the job done without all of that fuss, you should consider using it, especially if it ends up being more reliable.

          "text": "Before I started the project, I was already vaguely familiar with the notion of an inverted index [1].  That small bit of knowledge meant that I knew where to start looking for more information and saved me a ton of time.  Inverted indices form the bulk of many search engines, with the big unknown being how you implement it.  I just had to find an adequate data structure for my application. To figure that out, I remember searching for articles on how to implement inverted indices.  Once I had a list of candidate strategies and data structures, I used Wikipedia supplemented by some textbooks like Skiena's [2] and occasionally some (somewhat outdated) information from NIST [3].  I found Wikipedia quite detailed for all of the data structures for this problem, so it was pretty easy to compare the tradeoffs between different design choices here.  I originally wanted to implement the inverted index as a hash table but decided to use a trie because it makes wildcard search easier to implement. After I developed most of the backend, I looked for books on \"information retrieval\" in general.  I found a history book (Bourne and Hahn 2003) on the development of these kind of search systems [4].  I read some portions of this book, and that helped confirm many of the design choices that I made.  I actually was just doing what people traditionally did when they first built these systems in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with more modern tools and much more information on hand. The harder part of this project for me was writing the interpreter.  I actually found YouTube videos on how to write recursive descent parsers to be the most helpful there, particular this one [5].  Textbooks were too theoretical and not concrete enough, though Crafting Interpreters was sometimes helpful [6].

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been mostly anti AI. I did experiment a bit with aider and free models, but my results were inconsistent, and nothing to worry about.<p>However, recently I have purchased the max plan from anthropic and have been vibing with Claude code since then. And wow, the results are very good. With a good enough prompt, and planning step, it could generate full features in a project with 20k LOC, with very little modifications needed by me after review.<p>I heard even more success stories from friends who gave Claude 3-4 different features that Claude would develop in parallel.<p>On top of that, everyone seems to produce side project at an astronomical rate, both among my friends, and here on HN where fully complete project that would take months to develop, seem to appear after few hours with Claude code.<p>So, my questions is, is programming as a profession cooked? Are most of us going to be replaced with a “supervisor” who runs coding agents all day?</p></p></p></p></div>",

We can take our hands off the steering wheel for longer stretches of time, this is true, but if you have production apps with real users that spend real money then going to sleep at the wheel is far too risky. Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product. The profession is changing, no doubt about it. But its obsolescence is probably decades away. reply",

          "text": "My ancient background in Lotus Notes dev offers a different perspective than most. Yep, it is a hated platform now, but back in its heyday, it had similar business impact to what we are seeing from LLMs now. Non-tech folk could whip out basic CRUD apps in a few minutes without knowing how to code. And they did. Those apps worked well for trivial functions, when not scaled beyond a small userbase. Yet when people got one right that solved a real problem in an effective way, the userbase stated to scale, the warts in the apps became apparent, the original creator could not keep up with the changes needed, and those of us who were professionals would get called in to re-create the whole thing to a professional standard. I really see the same thing at our current level of AI. People are whipping out basic apps that work for small problems that are solved by small solutions. And it works. But without professionals intervening and correcting all the small problems along the way, it doesn't scale. Professional software engineers still need to exist to be sure that the solutions being created are scalable. Will we spend as much time typing out specific lines of code? Probably not. But will the jobs still be there? Absolutely. Perhaps even with more variety because we can focus more on the actual problems being solved. We will do more take-over work of apps that people got started but cannot finish. We'll refactor apps that got coded into corners, and spend more time talking directly to customers to understand what we are really trying to accomplish. It will be different work, but it will be there. reply",

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

If this is what you're discussing, I have no worries - automation taking a significant portion of jobs, including software engineering, is a huge worry. The other thing is this almost schadenfreude of intelligence. The argument goes something like, if AGI is a superset of all our intellectual, physical, and mental capabilities, what point is there of humans? Not from an economic perspective, but literally, a \"why do humans exist\" perspective? It would be \"rational\" to defer all of your thinking to a hyperintelligent AGI. Obviously. The latter sentiment I see a decent bit on hackernews. You see it encoded in psychoanalytic comments like, \"Humans have had the special privilege of being intelligent for so long, that they can't fathom that something else is more intelligent than them.\" For me, the only actionable conclusion I can see from a philosophy like this is to Lie Down and Rot. You are not allowed to use your thinking, because a rational superagent has simply thought about it more objectively and harder than you. I don't know. That kind of thinking, be it from intuitively when I was in my teens, to learning about government and ethics (Rational Utopianism, etc.) has always ticked me off. Incidentally, every single person who's thought that way unequivocally, I've disliked. Of course, if you phrase it like this, you'll get called irrational and quickly get compared to not so nice things. I don't care. Compare me all you want to unsavory figures, this kind of psychoanalytic gaslighting statement is never conducive to \"good human living\". Don't care if the rebuttal analogy is \"well, you're a toddler throwing a tantrum, while the AGI simply moves on\". You can't let ideologies like the second get to you. reply",

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs.

But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule.

But not one cares about my programming in C on mainframes in the 90s) including 2 leading AWS architecture at a startup and 3.5 working directly at AWS (full time consulting division). After being Amazoned for shits and giggles I randomly applied for hundreds of jobs that I was qualified for - I heard crickets.  I never do this and I didn’t expect much to come from it. I did her multiple offers in a couple of weeks via my network and targeted outreach to recruiters where I was an industry expert in a niche of AWS that’s popular.  But not many people have experience with. On another note, the mid size company I work for sent around 300 offers last year and we had an offer/application rate of 0.4%.

Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

I imagine it could even work like Sponsorblock does, and we could crowdsource people who's comments are inflammatory. I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt.

It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though.

I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

Researched it substantially and realized it's an unsolved problem. Anything that makes a dent is incomplete and comes with ugly tradeoffs. For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online.

However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network.

          "text": "\"10 parallel agents\" was just one guy with access to unlimited credits. Most of us are on Max plan or API plan, and cant afford to burn credits. He can just run the agents just to show that he is running 10 parallel agents. As an avg dev, what I can even do with 10 agents? It like managing 10 toddlers who can code, it looks good but it becomes hard to manage as you have limited context in your brain. 2 is the best setup if you can afford. One can write Tests and other can write the code. This is better because if you just use the same agent instance, its not gonna be able to write good tests as it will just write tests that its code is gonna pass. Its different for everyone else, but for me, 2 is the best setup for TDD. Apart from that, you can just go ahead and do it your own way. I have found that many senior engineers think they are special when they can make Claude Code do something, they think its with their setup but I am usually able to replicate without any setups or Agents.md/Claude.md, the models are good enough without any complex setup. reply",
