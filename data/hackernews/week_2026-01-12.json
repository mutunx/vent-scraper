          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret. - OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly. OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch. Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

We built it after working in the industry and seeing families struggle a lot with navigating the complex aged care system (at a time in their lives which is already very stressful). It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these. Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey. The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective). One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db. reply",

We’re taking a local-first approach with electric as a sync engine. All interactions against our own apis are instant with optimistic updates. Making the app feel more like a native app rather than the typical web app. Taking this approach has lead to some interesting challenges, both in technical and product areas. Some features requires third party roundtrips (summaries, labelling, embedding etc..) which breaks the \"instant\" system. We’re experimenting with ways to design those flows so the system still feels fast. Currently we only have one \"loading\" request in the entire system. Having all data available on the client has also lead to some neat benefits. No need to compose or build your typical GET endpoints in the API. You just query the client DB directly!

The way I see it is that I can just text my assistant bot and ask it something like \"hey, can you research which NAS setup would be the best for me given x and y\". It will offer some setup and I would say \"can you add it to the plan\" and \"can you plan the next steps for me?\". The bot will also update the knowledgebase and version control it. You might also want to use it for something like planning a trip to Paris, where at some point you might say \"hey, given my schedule, can you squeeze a tour to top5 croissant places in the center of Paris\". The whole thing sound really vague and sounds like something solved long ago, but I cannot find solutions that will be guaranteed to stick to a very precise plan that I can review at any given moment.

          "text": "VersionAlert: https://versionalert.com For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get. It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful. https://riffradar.org/ reply",

Things like manually reconciling data between billing, support, and ops, or preparing the same reports in slightly different formats for different stakeholders. These processes usually start small and “temporary,” but scale quietly as the company grows. The trade-off is that they’re hard to automate cleanly because ownership isn’t always clear. Curious whether the pain you’re seeing is more about fragmented data or about human approval loops that automation alone doesn’t fully eliminate? reply",

In some large businesses I've worked in, so many people have been hired that some systems and processes have wound up being controlled by entirely different people from the people who need them. So coordination between people and waiting for people who have little to no incentive to do the thing they're being asked to takes up a large part of the working day. 2. In other businesses, a large fraction, or even a large majority of the employees have had no discernible job except to talk and write about the job performed by the few people doing an actual job. So a lot of time in these businesses would be spent dodging meeting invitations, rejecting grand ideas about revolutionizing the business with AI on the blockchain, saying no to \"if you could X, that'd be great\" and generally reminding people that they're not in charge. The great thing about these problems is that you're not very likely to have them in a small startup, but if you decide to grow the organization later, you'll need to be very vigilant about how you scale. reply",

          "text": "I recently wrote a command-line full-text search engine [1].  I needed to implement an inverted index.  I choose what seems like the \"dumb\" solution at first glance: a trie (prefix tree). There are \"smarter\" solutions like radix tries, hash tables, or even skip lists, but for any design choice, you also have to examine the tradeoffs.  A goal of my project is to make the code simpler to understand and less of a black box, so a simpler data structure made sense, especially since other design choices would not have been all that much faster or use that much less memory for this application. I guess the moral of the story is to just examine all your options during the design stage.  Machine learning solutions are just that, another tool in the toolbox.  If another simpler and often cheaper solution gets the job done without all of that fuss, you should consider using it, especially if it ends up being more reliable.

          "text": "Before I started the project, I was already vaguely familiar with the notion of an inverted index [1].  That small bit of knowledge meant that I knew where to start looking for more information and saved me a ton of time.  Inverted indices form the bulk of many search engines, with the big unknown being how you implement it.  I just had to find an adequate data structure for my application. To figure that out, I remember searching for articles on how to implement inverted indices.  Once I had a list of candidate strategies and data structures, I used Wikipedia supplemented by some textbooks like Skiena's [2] and occasionally some (somewhat outdated) information from NIST [3].  I found Wikipedia quite detailed for all of the data structures for this problem, so it was pretty easy to compare the tradeoffs between different design choices here.  I originally wanted to implement the inverted index as a hash table but decided to use a trie because it makes wildcard search easier to implement. After I developed most of the backend, I looked for books on \"information retrieval\" in general.  I found a history book (Bourne and Hahn 2003) on the development of these kind of search systems [4].  I read some portions of this book, and that helped confirm many of the design choices that I made.  I actually was just doing what people traditionally did when they first built these systems in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with more modern tools and much more information on hand. The harder part of this project for me was writing the interpreter.  I actually found YouTube videos on how to write recursive descent parsers to be the most helpful there, particular this one [5].  Textbooks were too theoretical and not concrete enough, though Crafting Interpreters was sometimes helpful [6].

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been mostly anti AI. I did experiment a bit with aider and free models, but my results were inconsistent, and nothing to worry about.<p>However, recently I have purchased the max plan from anthropic and have been vibing with Claude code since then. And wow, the results are very good. With a good enough prompt, and planning step, it could generate full features in a project with 20k LOC, with very little modifications needed by me after review.<p>I heard even more success stories from friends who gave Claude 3-4 different features that Claude would develop in parallel.<p>On top of that, everyone seems to produce side project at an astronomical rate, both among my friends, and here on HN where fully complete project that would take months to develop, seem to appear after few hours with Claude code.<p>So, my questions is, is programming as a profession cooked? Are most of us going to be replaced with a “supervisor” who runs coding agents all day?</p></p></p></p></div>",

We can take our hands off the steering wheel for longer stretches of time, this is true, but if you have production apps with real users that spend real money then going to sleep at the wheel is far too risky. Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product. The profession is changing, no doubt about it. But its obsolescence is probably decades away. reply",

          "text": "My ancient background in Lotus Notes dev offers a different perspective than most. Yep, it is a hated platform now, but back in its heyday, it had similar business impact to what we are seeing from LLMs now. Non-tech folk could whip out basic CRUD apps in a few minutes without knowing how to code. And they did. Those apps worked well for trivial functions, when not scaled beyond a small userbase. Yet when people got one right that solved a real problem in an effective way, the userbase stated to scale, the warts in the apps became apparent, the original creator could not keep up with the changes needed, and those of us who were professionals would get called in to re-create the whole thing to a professional standard. I really see the same thing at our current level of AI. People are whipping out basic apps that work for small problems that are solved by small solutions. And it works. But without professionals intervening and correcting all the small problems along the way, it doesn't scale. Professional software engineers still need to exist to be sure that the solutions being created are scalable. Will we spend as much time typing out specific lines of code? Probably not. But will the jobs still be there? Absolutely. Perhaps even with more variety because we can focus more on the actual problems being solved. We will do more take-over work of apps that people got started but cannot finish. We'll refactor apps that got coded into corners, and spend more time talking directly to customers to understand what we are really trying to accomplish. It will be different work, but it will be there. reply",

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

If this is what you're discussing, I have no worries - automation taking a significant portion of jobs, including software engineering, is a huge worry. The other thing is this almost schadenfreude of intelligence. The argument goes something like, if AGI is a superset of all our intellectual, physical, and mental capabilities, what point is there of humans? Not from an economic perspective, but literally, a \"why do humans exist\" perspective? It would be \"rational\" to defer all of your thinking to a hyperintelligent AGI. Obviously. The latter sentiment I see a decent bit on hackernews. You see it encoded in psychoanalytic comments like, \"Humans have had the special privilege of being intelligent for so long, that they can't fathom that something else is more intelligent than them.\" For me, the only actionable conclusion I can see from a philosophy like this is to Lie Down and Rot. You are not allowed to use your thinking, because a rational superagent has simply thought about it more objectively and harder than you. I don't know. That kind of thinking, be it from intuitively when I was in my teens, to learning about government and ethics (Rational Utopianism, etc.) has always ticked me off. Incidentally, every single person who's thought that way unequivocally, I've disliked. Of course, if you phrase it like this, you'll get called irrational and quickly get compared to not so nice things. I don't care. Compare me all you want to unsavory figures, this kind of psychoanalytic gaslighting statement is never conducive to \"good human living\". Don't care if the rebuttal analogy is \"well, you're a toddler throwing a tantrum, while the AGI simply moves on\". You can't let ideologies like the second get to you. reply",

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs.

But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule.

But not one cares about my programming in C on mainframes in the 90s) including 2 leading AWS architecture at a startup and 3.5 working directly at AWS (full time consulting division). After being Amazoned for shits and giggles I randomly applied for hundreds of jobs that I was qualified for - I heard crickets.  I never do this and I didn’t expect much to come from it. I did her multiple offers in a couple of weeks via my network and targeted outreach to recruiters where I was an industry expert in a niche of AWS that’s popular.  But not many people have experience with. On another note, the mid size company I work for sent around 300 offers last year and we had an offer/application rate of 0.4%.

Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

I imagine it could even work like Sponsorblock does, and we could crowdsource people who's comments are inflammatory. I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt.

It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though.

I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

Researched it substantially and realized it's an unsolved problem. Anything that makes a dent is incomplete and comes with ugly tradeoffs. For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online.

However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network.

          "text": "\"10 parallel agents\" was just one guy with access to unlimited credits. Most of us are on Max plan or API plan, and cant afford to burn credits. He can just run the agents just to show that he is running 10 parallel agents. As an avg dev, what I can even do with 10 agents? It like managing 10 toddlers who can code, it looks good but it becomes hard to manage as you have limited context in your brain. 2 is the best setup if you can afford. One can write Tests and other can write the code. This is better because if you just use the same agent instance, its not gonna be able to write good tests as it will just write tests that its code is gonna pass. Its different for everyone else, but for me, 2 is the best setup for TDD. Apart from that, you can just go ahead and do it your own way. I have found that many senior engineers think they are special when they can make Claude Code do something, they think its with their setup but I am usually able to replicate without any setups or Agents.md/Claude.md, the models are good enough without any complex setup. reply",

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

Except, it's just a repo organisation system (structure, conventions, and tools) that lets me share common \"parts\" across multiple \"projects\". No monolithic frameworks here. Libraries are functions. Apps are objects. However, normally, we use these as distinct artefacts, eventually leading to the \"diamond dependency\" problem (and lots of other annoying development-time stuff caused by libs / code that is \"over there\" (elsewhere)).

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

          "text": "Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours. claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these. Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey. The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective). One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db. reply",

Many indie artists perform there and have followings, and that is just one potential site to share your work. Sure, to become a household name you gotta grow from there and it is a tough road, but the ability to put out your music is crazy stronger today than in days of yore.

          "text": "I recently wrote a command-line full-text search engine [1].  I needed to implement an inverted index.  I choose what seems like the \"dumb\" solution at first glance: a trie (prefix tree). There are \"smarter\" solutions like radix tries, hash tables, or even skip lists, but for any design choice, you also have to examine the tradeoffs.  A goal of my project is to make the code simpler to understand and less of a black box, so a simpler data structure made sense, especially since other design choices would not have been all that much faster or use that much less memory for this application. I guess the moral of the story is to just examine all your options during the design stage.  Machine learning solutions are just that, another tool in the toolbox.  If another simpler and often cheaper solution gets the job done without all of that fuss, you should consider using it, especially if it ends up being more reliable.

          "text": "Before I started the project, I was already vaguely familiar with the notion of an inverted index [1].  That small bit of knowledge meant that I knew where to start looking for more information and saved me a ton of time.  Inverted indices form the bulk of many search engines, with the big unknown being how you implement it.  I just had to find an adequate data structure for my application. To figure that out, I remember searching for articles on how to implement inverted indices.  Once I had a list of candidate strategies and data structures, I used Wikipedia supplemented by some textbooks like Skiena's [2] and occasionally some (somewhat outdated) information from NIST [3].  I found Wikipedia quite detailed for all of the data structures for this problem, so it was pretty easy to compare the tradeoffs between different design choices here.  I originally wanted to implement the inverted index as a hash table but decided to use a trie because it makes wildcard search easier to implement. After I developed most of the backend, I looked for books on \"information retrieval\" in general.  I found a history book (Bourne and Hahn 2003) on the development of these kind of search systems [4].  I read some portions of this book, and that helped confirm many of the design choices that I made.  I actually was just doing what people traditionally did when they first built these systems in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with more modern tools and much more information on hand. The harder part of this project for me was writing the interpreter.  I actually found YouTube videos on how to write recursive descent parsers to be the most helpful there, particular this one [5].  Textbooks were too theoretical and not concrete enough, though Crafting Interpreters was sometimes helpful [6].

I ended up writing a small release tag driven generator: it walks git tags, collects merged PRs between releases, buckets them into categories, and renders Markdown/MDX grouped by year -&gt; month -&gt; category -&gt; version. I also added an optional LLM step that outputs structured JSON via Pydantic schema for PR bullets that includes monthly summaries. It is idempotent and preserves manual edits or omissions, so you can auto-generate, then curate over time.<p>I’m curious what works for you in practice:<p>- Towncrier?<p>- reno?<p>- GitHub Releases / auto-generated notes?<p>- something else?<p>What do you like/hate about your current setup? Any tools you’d recommend?<p>If anyone wants to see the script I wrote, I am happy to share it and would love some constructive feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Full disclosure, I’m one of the owners of ReleaseNotes.io. Not trying to pitch, just sharing what we see across a lot of teams. 1. For OSS projects, GitHub Releases honestly work really well. You usually have contributors who understand the context, and readers who are technical enough to parse a changelog. 2. If you're talking to users, Release notes stop being a dev artifact and become a communication channel. They need to show up where users already are, in-app, email, Slack, etc. There are a bunch of tools like us (ReleaseNotes.io), LaunchNotes, AnnounceKit, Canny and others that help with that. 3. From what we see, the teams that have the most success with automation of this process treat GitHub PRs or Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, GitHub issues as the source of truth. Also their issues/PR descriptions tend to clearly describe the problem and the solution. 4. Any automation of this process leans heavily on the quality of your issue/PR descriptions as garbage-in = garbage-out. Because of this it's tricky to fully automate the process as at some level you usually need a person casting an eye over the release note just to sense check. reply",

When I first started looking for a release notes strategy, I was considering towncrier for that exact reason. You are also right that commit messages are not intended for the consumer of the release, but a dialogue between developers. Your points are well received and largely why I went PR-based (title/body with optional GitHub metadata) instead of commit-based. A PR title and body tend to be focused on the deliverable, whereas commit messages are narrowly focused on the code change at that moment with developers as the intended audience. Re: git-cliff, I honestly hadn’t evaluated this one, but it looks solid for commit-driven changelogs. I like the rationale behind conventional commits being parsable and templates enforcing consistency. What constraints pushed you toward git-cliff vs writing release notes by hand, and do you have a config/template you have found works well for surfacing breaking changes? reply",

          "text": "I run a small team building Dreamlux.ai (AI video generation). AI changed my day-to-day in a few concrete ways: Coding: I write less boilerplate and more “integration glue”. LLMs are great for scaffolding (Next.js routes, workers, SQL migrations) and translating logs/errors into hypotheses. Biggest win is speed from idea → working PR, not perfect code. Debugging/ops: I paste real production symptoms (headers, cache status, curl repros, traces) and ask for ranked root-cause candidates + experiments. This reduced “blind poking” a lot, especially around CDN caching rules, 429s, image optimization, and edge-case billing/credits. Planning/reviews: We now require “AI-assisted PR reviews” to include: risk list, test plan, rollback steps, and what metrics should move. It’s basically a checklist generator + reviewer #2. Humans still make the call. What stuck: ChatGPT + a copilot in editor for daily work; LLM as a “rubber duck” for incident triage and for turning messy notes into specs. What felt like hype: autonomous agents that “own” features end-to-end. Without tight scopes, they wander; with tight scopes, they’re just faster scripts. The sweet spot is human-led, AI-accelerated loops. Curious: for managers, what’s your best process change that AI enabled (not just “wrote code faster”)? reply",

Copilot for code completion + reviews or small snippets/functions but larger code/module generation has been weak so far. Claude for full modules generation or complex multi-file edits. Research: Grok (less filtered + better search), Claude (complex dev topics), GPT (balanced but sometimes slanted and/or seems to favor certain sources). My Teams: Mostly Copilot for code completion/reviews, mix of GPT/Claude for code. Last year was loose/experimental to learn but we plan to formalize guidelines more this quarter.

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs. Example: You need to learn a new language/framework and maybe spend some extra hours outside of work for a few weeks to ramp up for a new project. But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule. It's all about managing when you grind and when you \"coast\". reply",

And wow, the results are very good. With a good enough prompt, and planning step, it could generate full features in a project with 20k LOC, with very little modifications needed by me after review.<p>I heard even more success stories from friends who gave Claude 3-4 different features that Claude would develop in parallel.<p>On top of that, everyone seems to produce side project at an astronomical rate, both among my friends, and here on HN where fully complete project that would take months to develop, seem to appear after few hours with Claude code.<p>So, my questions is, is programming as a profession cooked? Are most of us going to be replaced with a “supervisor” who runs coding agents all day?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "My ancient background in Lotus Notes dev offers a different perspective than most. Yep, it is a hated platform now, but back in its heyday, it had similar business impact to what we are seeing from LLMs now. Non-tech folk could whip out basic CRUD apps in a few minutes without knowing how to code. And they did. Those apps worked well for trivial functions, when not scaled beyond a small userbase. Yet when people got one right that solved a real problem in an effective way, the userbase stated to scale, the warts in the apps became apparent, the original creator could not keep up with the changes needed, and those of us who were professionals would get called in to re-create the whole thing to a professional standard. I really see the same thing at our current level of AI. People are whipping out basic apps that work for small problems that are solved by small solutions. And it works. But without professionals intervening and correcting all the small problems along the way, it doesn't scale. Professional software engineers still need to exist to be sure that the solutions being created are scalable. Will we spend as much time typing out specific lines of code? Probably not. But will the jobs still be there? Absolutely. Perhaps even with more variety because we can focus more on the actual problems being solved. We will do more take-over work of apps that people got started but cannot finish. We'll refactor apps that got coded into corners, and spend more time talking directly to customers to understand what we are really trying to accomplish. It will be different work, but it will be there. reply",

What I think will actually happen is that a new breed of programmers with extensive mathematical background will start designing unprecedented software (or even digital circuits through high-level synthesis) that are almost correct by construction at a much faster rate with the combination of formal specification and AI coding. The field of computer aided design (CAD) will likely explode, and we will witness spaceships, nanobots, etc. being churned out at the rate of React websites. The whole computing field will become so high level that applied mathematics like optimal control, optimal transport, information geometry, etc. will become bread and butter for any programmer. At the same time, there will be a new breed of artists that starts making games, movies, etc. with AI alone. We will witness a whole new form of artistic expression. reply",

We can take our hands off the steering wheel for longer stretches of time, this is true, but if you have production apps with real users that spend real money then going to sleep at the wheel is far too risky. Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product. The profession is changing, no doubt about it. But its obsolescence is probably decades away. reply",

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

If this is what you're discussing, I have no worries - automation taking a significant portion of jobs, including software engineering, is a huge worry. The other thing is this almost schadenfreude of intelligence. The argument goes something like, if AGI is a superset of all our intellectual, physical, and mental capabilities, what point is there of humans? Not from an economic perspective, but literally, a \"why do humans exist\" perspective? It would be \"rational\" to defer all of your thinking to a hyperintelligent AGI. Obviously. The latter sentiment I see a decent bit on hackernews. You see it encoded in psychoanalytic comments like, \"Humans have had the special privilege of being intelligent for so long, that they can't fathom that something else is more intelligent than them.\" For me, the only actionable conclusion I can see from a philosophy like this is to Lie Down and Rot. You are not allowed to use your thinking, because a rational superagent has simply thought about it more objectively and harder than you. I don't know. That kind of thinking, be it from intuitively when I was in my teens, to learning about government and ethics (Rational Utopianism, etc.) has always ticked me off. Incidentally, every single person who's thought that way unequivocally, I've disliked. Of course, if you phrase it like this, you'll get called irrational and quickly get compared to not so nice things. I don't care. Compare me all you want to unsavory figures, this kind of psychoanalytic gaslighting statement is never conducive to \"good human living\". Don't care if the rebuttal analogy is \"well, you're a toddler throwing a tantrum, while the AGI simply moves on\". You can't let ideologies like the second get to you. reply",

Bank reconciliation seems simple - two lists, match them - but then you hit timing differences where something cleared on different dates in each system, or description mismatches where the bank shows \"PAYPAL *ACME\" but you recorded \"Acme Ltd - Invoice 4521\". Transaction categorisation is arguably worse because there's no universal standard. What one accountant calls \"Office Expenses\" another puts in \"General Admin\" - both correct for their context. Any automation that works for one client's books tends to break when you switch to another. reply",

In some large businesses I've worked in, so many people have been hired that some systems and processes have wound up being controlled by entirely different people from the people who need them. So coordination between people and waiting for people who have little to no incentive to do the thing they're being asked to takes up a large part of the working day. 2. In other businesses, a large fraction, or even a large majority of the employees have had no discernible job except to talk and write about the job performed by the few people doing an actual job. So a lot of time in these businesses would be spent dodging meeting invitations, rejecting grand ideas about revolutionizing the business with AI on the blockchain, saying no to \"if you could X, that'd be great\" and generally reminding people that they're not in charge. The great thing about these problems is that you're not very likely to have them in a small startup, but if you decide to grow the organization later, you'll need to be very vigilant about how you scale. reply",

I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership?

I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't think a captcha is the solution, as it'll degrade conversation by an OOM though. reply",

I only learned about it after I asked via a non-public channel, with evidence. Otherwise I wouldn't have known, and I suspect most users are unaware. What I cited in previous comment is also from a non-public conversations. If I'm wrong and it's documented publicly in rules or users are notified when it happens to them, I'm happy to be corrected, link? reply",

It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though.

Do you want a ranking system where more the people downvote some person, the better? if so how do you prevent spam in that, do you take metrics like karma or what exactly? I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online.

However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network. I would cancel my last credit card, but I don’t want to deal with cell phone deposits and other nonsense, like I had to in the past. reply",

I have had very low cholesterol for 20 years, even though 70% of my calories are quality fats. never been an ounce overweight. constant 83Kg forever ketogenic diets are now prescribed as a no drug cure for Diabetes with very good research into Epilepsy. As well as the ketogenic diet, I have chosen all my life never eat any food that is squirted out of a machine (breakfast cereals etc). this includes all take away foods like macdonalds, pizza's, and bleached chicken companies. THIS FOOD IS NOT DESIGNED FOR HUMANS. I am a martial artist, aikido brown belt and shotokan orange belt. power walk 6 miles, three time a week, rain or shine. For mental well being, I cook organic food and bake sourdough breads for my local mental health charity and local church. This is for those less fortunate that need support. I never ever take any drugs that are prescribed by a doctor. I learned over 20 years as a psychotherapist that most GP's here in the UK, do not know all there is about the drugs they prescribe. Their prescribing decison are made from the sales brochures they receive and from pressure salesmen promoting the drugs from big pharma. The only medical people I trust are those that really matter. In particualar those who work in surgical practice. Surgeons in all fields are amazing. Now those people are the real life savers and know their stuff. Ive not watched the TV for 25 years, which in turn makes me autonomous, individual and self regulated. Unaffected by the manipulative brain washing propaganda of mass media companies. Being a linux (arch BTW) user also has its mental health benefits. less stress being the main one, and no poxy anti-virus or three days updates. I realised early on in my life that by giving more than you receive is the key to our own mental well being. For instance, I realised during my psychotherapy training that the people who needed psychotherapy the most, were the people who could not afford it. So I worked pro bono for 10 years as a volunteer psychotherapist and gave my time for free. reply",

          "text": "States like Iran have signal catchers, where they can get a rough idea where a signal is coming from through triangulation.  The US military has had this for over 20 years now.  Often these coordinates are fed in as targets into weapons systems. If you're going the radio route these come to mind: Meshtastic: 1W, one band, local.  Useful if Iran doesn't know about it.  But easy to jam and probably triangulate. Wifi Halow: 1W, can possibly hop between bands, but probably also really easy to jam and triangulate. WSPR:  Possibly good, transmitters can hide in the noise floor, and can go long distances with 100mW of power, but slow.  Probably triangulable, very easy to jam once located in the spectrum.   Data can be transmitted and received with off the shelf components. Military Radios:  Very good.  Transmitters can frequency hop, making triangulation and jamming difficult.  Also encryption.  You can easily transmit in the same frequency space that Iran would be using to avoid jamming.  But also, mostly unobtanium.  I have heard stories about US military radios showing up at Ham Fests. reply",

So the message might go the wrong direction, say.  Or, worse, a meshtastic radio in a basement might get priority. Because they didn't understand (or care about) network topologies from the start and reliable message transmission, not to mention the versions of devices that are still on their network,  I'm guessing it's gonna be a couple more years before they finally get their act together. reply",

          "text": "Couriers and USB flash drives can be pretty effective. They're high latency but can be very high bandwidth. Look at the El Paquete network in Cuba[0] as inspiration. Self-contained HTML/JavaScript SPAs can provide navigation and the likes of TiddlyWiki[1] can allow for collaboration. A network of couriers can move as fast as road traffic and distribute stuff pretty widely. Contents can be re-shared locally over ad-hoc or mesh WiFi networks even without Internet access. Encryption and steganography can obscure the contents of drives from casual inspection. You can stuff a lot of extraneous data in Office XML documents that are just zip files and look innocuous when opened. 1. For current events content add descriptions, locations, and timestamps to everything. The recipients need that context. 2. Even unencrypted files can be verified with cryptographic signatures. These can be distributed on separate channels including Bluetooth file transfers. 3. Include offline installers for browsers like Dillo or Firefox. Favor plain text formats where possible. FAT32 has the broadest support in terms of file system for the flash drives. Batch, PowerShell, and bash scripts can also be effective in doing more complex things while not needing local installation or invasive installations on people's computers.

So that it would work better with very high latency sneaker-net flash-drive networks?  Especially for the already asynchronous ones like email?  I could envision a user with a messenger/email-like client who \"sends\" (encrypted) messages that get put on a flash drive.  This is carried around the neighborhood, etc, where others do the same.  Eventually someone takes it to a machine with regular internet access, where the messages get delivered to their intended recipients.  And then replies to these messages (coming hours, days, weeks later) also get put on a flash drive, and maybe hopefully get back to the original receivers.  And if the internet-down situation has been resolved, the recipients will already have their messages, but if not, they'll get them when the flash drive arrives.

          "text": "There is no privacy in amateur radio. That is not a matter of preference, it is a regulatory and physical reality. Amateur radio transmissions are public, unencrypted, and attributable. Callsigns are required, modes and frequencies are well known, and transmissions are trivially direction-findable. In a country like Iran, where RF spectrum is actively monitored and unauthorized communications are treated as a security issue, transmitting on amateur bands is effectively broadcasting your location and intent. Direction finding is routine, fast, and does not require exotic equipment. One transmission can be enough. In the US and most other countries, amateur radio is tightly regulated. Encryption to obscure content is explicitly prohibited. Ignoring this can result in fines, seizure of equipment, and loss of license. Foreign operators encouraging or participating in such use are not insulated from consequences simply because the target country is authoritarian. I did not claim to have a better solution. That's the point. When the threat model includes surveillance, attribution, and enforcement, there may be no safe civilian workaround. Suggesting amateur radio in this context is not “imperfect but helpful”, it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what amateur radio actually is and how it is regulated. Amateur radio can't provide privacy, safety, or reliable information flow under an active crackdown. Pretending otherwise is irresponsible. reply",

Power on. Download Starlink app (iOS/Android) or use web interface. Connect phone/PC to Starlink Wi-Fi. Follow app prompts to activate (no subscription needed in Iran now). Meshtastic (LoRa mesh, long-range offline text):\nBuy compatible device (e.g., Heltec/RAK ESP32 LoRa board). Flash latest firmware via web flasher (meshtastic.org). Install Meshtastic app (Android/iOS). Connect via Bluetooth. Set region (e.g., EU433/US915 based on hardware). Create/join channel with shared key. Messages hop device-to-device. Noghteha (Bluetooth mesh, Iran-specific, offline):\nDownload Noghteha APK (Google Play or sideloading). Install on Android. Open app—no account needed. Enable Bluetooth. Messages auto-hop via nearby phones in mesh. Briar (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi P2P, offline secure messaging):\nDownload Briar APK (briarproject.org or F-Droid). Install on Android. Create account (nickname + password). Add contacts: meet in person and scan QR, or share link via other channel. Enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for sync when in range. Messages store & forward when devices meet. Delta Chat (email-based, works if any outbound email possible):\nDownload Delta Chat app (delta.chat). Use chatmail server for auto-account (no personal email needed). Or add existing email. Add contacts via QR/link. Send messages (E2EE). Relies on email transit; resilient to blocks if email partially works. Carrier pigeons: (communications w/ nearby states). Code Talkers:\nUse minority Iranian languages (e.g., Kurdish, Balochi, Azerbaijani) as codes for voice/radio comms, training speakers to encode military/civil strategies, similar to WWII code talkers—resilient if monitors lack fluency. Sci-fi alien languages (e.g., Klingon, Na'vi) could work if users learn them for encrypted messaging apps or calls, but impractical due to learning curve and detection risks in which case create your own code talker language with an AI. e.g.,\nStratCode System\nAlphabet: Use 10 simple symbols for phonetics (easy to draw/speak): ⊙ (oh) - Open circle for vowels like O/A.\n| (ih) - Line for I/E.\n△ (ah) - Triangle for A/U.\n× (kh) - X for hard consonants K/G.\n~ (sh) - Wave for S/Sh.\n□ (th) - Square for T/D.\n○ (eh) - Empty circle for E.\n/ (fh) - Slash for F/V.\n\\ (rh) - Backslash for R/L.

I have thoughts, ideas, projects, concepts, links, things to read... fired at my brain all day every day. I can go deep on a topic for hours, but then be hit by a barrage of micro ideas. I really struggle to stay on track and focus. Oh and I run a business, manage people, try to make a profit. It's hard. And kids. And life?<p>I think there is a founder/ADHD thing. Paul Graham thinks so. Maybe even a tech person angle. What have other people experienced?<p>And how do others cope? I don't really know this world. I do know that my old boss once called me a \"flagitating laser beam\". I think he meant distracted. I use a bunch of systems to cope. For a long time lists, and then Asana. Asana ruled my life. I just built my own thing to capture tasks, projects, but also knowlegde. Not sure if it will help we will see.<p>So tell me:<p>- Who else feels this way?\n- How do you manage?\n- Oh and how do you switch off? That is hard</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Most responses here are about systems and tools — which help, but they're compensations working around the issue rather than at it. The underlying problem is network regulation in the brain. Your Default Mode Network (the self-referential mind-wandering system) is supposed to quiet down when you engage in tasks. In ADHD, that toggle is unreliable — the DMN keeps intruding, which is why you get that \"barrage of micro ideas\" breaking through during focus. A few things that work at the root: Meditation — not as a relaxation tool, but as direct neuroplasticity training. Focused attention practice (noticing when your mind wandered, returning to object) is literally thousands of reps training that DMN/task-positive toggle. Long-term meditators show measurably better DMN suppression during tasks. Sleep — DMN regulation degrades hard with poor sleep. Non-negotiable foundation. The deeper move is changing your relationship to the thoughts themselves. The DMN will always generate ideas. The shift is recognizing them as arisings rather than commands. They still come — they just lose their grip. reply",

Anyone that tells you that you just need to try one \"trick\", a planner, a mindset change, default mode networks, \"try sleeping more\", whatever, can either never understand what it's like or is trying to sell you something. Or both. If someone neurotypical gives you advice, just smile and nod, and ignore it. If someone tells you ADHD is a \"superpower\" promptly ignore them. Unfortunately, this often applies to generalist doctors who don't specialise in ADHD. The reality is that there is no single thing that will help. You'll have to try shit and see what works for you. What one person swears \"fixed\" them might do nothing for you. That said, the one thing that is the most likely to work out is medication. Get yourself a diagnosis, try the meds, see if it helps.

I have a general to-do file and a tech todo file, and then notes.txt. When my notex.txt grows too long, which I define as having to scroll at all, I start to break it up. When I break it up, I personally use latex files. I know everyone loves markdown, but I'm not a fan of Obsidian (closed source and electron, ugh), so I fell in love with TexStudio. I have keybindings for simple macros to insert sections and subsections that I can quickly name, and these display in the navigation tree very well. TexStudio also allows multiple tex files open at once with a tabbedinterface, and allows saving sessions, so I can open one file to open all my, say, 'ai app ideas' notes. I've found this to work better for myself than any other available app or solution. Eventually, I'd like to release a fork which would mainly be trimming stuff out rather than really adding anything in, but it's far from a priority for me at the moment. reply",

I take Concerta and drink Coffee, but I mostly just enjoy the coffee. It's really hard to stay on track sometimes, it's really hard to go too long without working on something inherently interesting to me. I'm constantly late and prefer late nights, I tend to always have a bad sleep cycle. Really basic things that other people seem good at, I struggle. Taxes, finances, anything that requires ambient awareness of systems that have no clear feedback loops. Sometimes penalties  for trivial things accumulate and it costs a lot of money. Goals, unless they're  something like literally climbing a mountain, don't really motivate me. I don't have any financial or life goals at all, they seem artificial and silly. Without stimulants, and a thankfully somewhat lenient company/client atm, I'd be screwed. The positive is that I seem to be much better at making friends than most other people I know, and enjoy a variety of interesting hobbies. I'm also not that fearful or anxious about trying new things. In terms of who I listen to about the topic, it's certainly not any entrepreneur types, it's mostly friends. Though Trevor Noah has a great podcast on the topic last April https://pca.st/episode/19d903d2-bb2b-4213-837e-89a1af706ea0 Additionally, I cope by exclusion. I don't obligate myself to many things or events, and refuse to participate in group chats. I keep almost no notifications on, and people know that if they need my attention, they can just call me, otherwise I won't respond until I get around to it. I only buy gifts when I find inspiration to, and try not to spread myself too thin. I also try to avoid easy things as much as possible. I failed at easy assignments, easy exams in school, why bother going through the rote motions for no other purpose than to be measured on my performance in doing them? reply",

If you do have ADHD then I don't think you should expect of yourself to be \"fixed\" to match the \"average\" norm. You will still be thinking about random stuff (\"be creative\"), it just will be a bit less of an issue in doing what is important. What seems to work for me: * meds * writing everything down. This is not ADHD specific advice, I got it from GTD and it decreased anxiety. Just get used to the feeling that you will pull it out when you need it. I keep looking around for better solutions, but I no longer expect to have one that is perfect. Currently peeking back into Obsidian, for how flexible it is, but not abandoning OmniFocus and other tools I use. * I prioritize regular sleep, but I allow myself digging deep in a subject that interests me from time to time * physical work is surprisingly relaxing * AI is becoming very important to me in completing tasks which are complex enough for me to get bored/tired/overwhelmed before reaching the finish line. A micro idea is great if you can tell Claude to implement it and come back to you. Even better when it succeeds :) The shorter time from starting to reward of completing is great for delivering. * schedule some time for learning new stuff, otherwise you will become tired that it's all work and no fun * delegate taking into account where you struggle the most. You might feel bad since you are delegating the most difficult work, but it might actually by trivial to people with brains with no such issues. * not everything needs to be done, prioritize and don't worry about the less important stuff your brain throws at you * it's more about setting time blocks to focus on something than reaching a specific goal. An hour scheduled in the calendar for support emails, for development, for reading... * cheer up, we're entering the best period so far for people having ideas and you will have plenty * [BONUS EDIT] noise-cancelling headphones :) reply",

          "text": "First of all if you have the money get an official diagnosis. While self diagnosis is often right, ADHD symptoms can have overlap with many other things so it is better to be sure. Now want a quick fix? If you can, get medication. It doesn't work for all people with ADHD but for those that it does it will give you the most bang for the buck. Now there is coping strategies. Therapists can help a lot. There is also people offering ADHD coaching. This is great because the coaches tend to have ADHD themselves and understand you. It helped me personally a lot but be warned that everyone can offer coaching so quality may wary. Last part is lifestyle. Sport. It is not optional. Running is amazing and will help you a lot but if you are not fit enough yet, walk. Walk every day for at least 30min. You need to. Also personally for me reading a physical book for at least 30min a day makes a huge, huge difference. Diet is important but what works varies from ADHD person to person. For me cutting out processed sugar was a good step. Also no caffeine. This may also vary but completely cutting it helped me personally a lot. Yes, it helps somewhat with executive function but only in the short term and does more harm than good in the long term. Generally any form form of self medication be it alcohol, weed and so on, cut it out. Again get proper medication if you can. Honestly accepting that you have ADHD or well at least some form of neurodivergency is already the biggest step. It gets so much easier once you learn how to properly manage it. reply",

The meds (Vyvanse) help somewhat, but the real key to improvement for me has been using Todoist. IME the real trick is using it consistently, and for everything. My routines (e.g. morning routine: meds, eat, coffee, brush teeth, brush the dog's teeth, etc etc) are all in Todoist, not because I struggle to focus on getting that stuff done in the morning (well, sometimes, perhaps) but because starting the day with do-easy-thing, mark-it-done, repeat, sets up the rest of the day to be run by Todoist instead of the bit of my brain that goes \"I know we should be getting ready to leave but WHAT IF YOU WROTE AN APP TO DO THIS COOL THING, JUST QUICKLY TRY THAT NOW, YOU CAN LEAVE AFTER\". I had a similar experience with org-mode too. It was great at work where I'm at my desk all day, and made a huge difference, but not having a good mobile experience makes it impractical for day-to-day home use. reply",

I don't take stimulants beyond caffeine, I meditate most days at least once a day, which I find helpful, as well as not stay up too late. I keep a pad of paper by my bed to capture ideas. Working to music seems to help. If you get a lot of ideas, you should reconcile yourself to only acting on a small fraction of them and worry less about all of the possibilities. I try to take care to keep the commitments that I make, writing them down and tracking them. And here it is important to keep a close track. I may be less impaired than you are, although many people have noticed I seem to get a lot of ideas. I collaborated with a partner on a book once, and at one point, about halfway through, he was frustrated with me and said, \"You are a geyser of ideas. We don't need more ideas, we need to complete what we set out to do.\" reply",

I also get a lot worse if I am letting a lot of tasks build up and I bounce around between them. Ultimately what worked for me was developing the ability to not react to something crossing my mind. Like in your example right when the micro idea would cross my mind after going deep, I'd just let that micro thought have a few seconds to pass through my mind, and not react to it. I wouldn't give into the thought \"I need to start doing this micro project!\" or have any kind of reaction. Once the immediate reaction passed I would decide whether it's worth changing my focus. This can also be used in the inverse, if I decide to go deep on something, periodically checking in to see if it's still worth going vs asking for help/input. reply",

Pages and pages of notes -- both to write an idea down to move away from it and as a way to make sure I do a task. It's way easier for me to accomplish something if I can obsessively plan it out in advance, and it's way easier to stop rolling an idea around in my head if I jot it down (potentially to be never entertained again.) It's a later step after diagnosis, but my doctor told me I'd be surprised at how effective medication can be. They were 100% right. It's not a cure all and it's not without potential side effects, but it makes me sad that it took me so long to approach my primary doctor about the issues. But as a side note, the medical info I've read makes a pretty firm statement that there is no late developing ADHD. One if the diagnostic criteria is that the symptoms occurred during childhood. Coping and your environment may affect the disorder's effect on your life, but it's with you for your life. _However_, adult diagnosis is very real. Your environment changes so much as you age, and it may or may not make ADHD worse.

You need to be able to record, triage, filter, prioritize, and execute on anything you need to remember. If any one of those stages is leaky you won't trust it and it won't last. My entire life is structured around managing it. I have to have very strong discipline. House must be spotless. Desk must be spotless. Try to work in the same place at the same time every day. Environmental and contextual stability is huge. Your brain must associate a particular desk, chair, place with doing the most important things. If you allow yourself to goof off or do other things in that place you are losing the fight. Working out fixes a lot for me too. I workout or my mood and motivation falls apart. Move or die. Again, consistency is key. Everything I do around environment is to reduce the need to use executive function. It is finite and fickle for people with ADHD. The more you have to think and convince yourself to do things the less likely you are to do them. You need consistent cues. \"Sit down here, start timer, means work on main thing and nothing else.\" If you can have discipline at all of these external things, the work can just happen and there is a kind of freedom in that. Program outlets. Give yourself set, specific time to explore the sidetracking. Don't tell your brain no. Tell it \"later\". It helps if you know there is time for the extra thoughts. That there is a relief valve. Also, drugs. I use prescribed stimulants. There are some unpleasant negative things, but I can function with them and life is better with them. But it isn't some magical cure. You still have to be organized and willing to work on your tasks or you will just be really focused on things you don't really need to be doing. I could write so much more, but that is some top of mind stuff that I think sits at the top of my hierarchy of being productive. Oh and you may need to have some conversations with future you. How is future you, a week, month, year from now going to feel if you burned a lot of time on side quests? reply",

It's worth talking to a doctor and getting the ball rolling on a formal diagnosis. ADHD is not the only diagnosis with those symptoms. For instance bipolar and autism spectrum disorder. Again, not a doctor, take that with a grain of salt. There are probably new tactics you can adopt in this thread, and they may help and are worth trying. Advice which is actionable today is valuable. But if this is severe enough to disrupt your life, the best strategy is a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes (eg exercise). Easier said than done, I know. I have my own issues I'm struggling with and I get it. I'm in the midst of trying that same three pronged approach. Please also understand that these diagnosis do not all have the same consequences for not treating them. If you don't want to pursue formal diagnosis and treatment, that is your right, but I would urge you to investigate whether or not you are bipolar in any case. If you have your first manic episode, and you don't understand that is what is happening, it could be dangerous. What you're describing sounds more like ADHD to me personally but is not inconsistent with hypomania either. Again, not a doctor, grain of salt. reply",

Are the Classical Computation models i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation</a> applicable? What other new models have been invented?<p>2) Quantum Computers: What is the Physics, Organization and Architecture of these? In classical computers you have semiconductor physics, electronic elements and voltage thresholds mapping to logical 1's and 0's. This is then used to build layers of abstractions. What are their equivalents in a quantum computer?  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing</a> has a lot of info. but not quite structured for understanding.<p>3) Quantum Programming: A lot is mentioned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming</a>  and Amazon lists a bunch of books on this topic but am not quite clear on how everything fits.\nAlso as i understand, quantum computing/programming can be simulated on classical hardware but am not clear on the how.<p>PS: Some detailed examples as to how quantum computers/programming actually help you solve problems which cannot be solved on classical computers would be helpful to bring everything together. Shor's algorithm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm</a>) is often mentioned but perhaps starting with a far simpler example would be more accessible.<p>PPS: In particular; I would love to hear from folks who actually study/research/work in this domain regarding what they actually do, its real-world applicabilities and how to go about learning the subject.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

If you don't have the equivalent of an undergrad CS/math/physics degree (with some linear algebra), it may be better to start with gentler sources. One such gentler source is the free online text I wrote with Andy Matuschak -- https://quantum.country .  I'm sure there are others which are very good, but perhaps that's helpful! Both books focus on foundations of the field, and don't cover recent innovations -- the book with Ike Chuang is 26 years old!  Still, many of the foundations have remained quite stable. reply",

For computers/architecture, think of qubits as noisy analog components and error correction as how digital reliability is built on top. Preskill’s NISQ notes are very clear here. For programming, most work is circuit construction and simulation on classical hardware (Qiskit, Cirq). That’s normal and expected.

          "text": "I worked at one of the quantum computing co's on their compiler stack (so pretty much pure classical compute stuff), but in order to have even a baseline understanding of the computations and programming using qubits, I had to first get a better intuition for the underlying quantum mechanics at play. This was a great introduction to the physics underpinning the computations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP... It's long, and the subject matter is intimidating at times, but watch, re-watch, then go deep by finding papers on subjects like superposition and entanglement, which are the key quantum phenomena that unlock quantum computing. It also helps to understand a bit about how various qubit modalities are physically operated and affected by the control systems (e.g. how does a program turn into qubit rotations, readouts, and other instruction executions). Some are superconducting chips using electromagnetic wave impulses, some are suspending an ion/atom and using lasers to mutate states, or photonic chips moving light through gates - among a handful of other modalities in the industry and academia. IBM's Qiskit platform may still have tooling, simulators, and visualizers that help you write a program and step through the operations on the qubit(s) managed by the program: https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit reply",

          "text": "For learning the theory behind quantum computing, I usually recommend Watrous's lecture notes [1] - they start out by immediately giving a helpful analogy to ordinary probabilistic computation. The online tutorial [2] is a good followup, especially if you want to understand  Clifford gates / stabilizer states, which are important for quantum error correction. If you have a more theoretical bent, you may enjoy learning about the ZX-calculus [3] - I found this useful for understanding how measurement-based quantum computing is supposed to work.

          "text": "1) Generally the two models of QC are the digital/circuit model (analogous to digital logic gates, with some caveats, such as reversibility of operations, no-cloning theorem), and analog computation (tuning the parameters of a continuous-time quantum system in your lab such that the system produces useful output) 2) The physics/architecture/organization depends heavily on the type of computer being discussed. In classical computing, one \"type\" of computer has won the arms race. This is not yet the case for quantum computers, there are several different physical processes through which people are trying to generate computation, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, photonics, quantum dots, neutral atoms, etc. 3) There are several ways that you can simulate quantum computation on classical hardware, perhaps the most common would be through something like IBM's Qiskit, where you can keep track of the degrees of freedom of the quantum computer throughout the computation, and apply quantum logic gates in circuits. Another, more complicated method, would be something like tensor network simulations, which are efficient classical simulators of a restricted subset of quantum states. 4) In terms of research, one particularly interesting (although I'm biased by working in the field) application is quantum algorithms for nuclear/high energy physics. Classical methods (Lattice QCD) suffer from extreme computational drawbacks (factorial scaling in the number of quarks, NP-Hard Monte Carlo sign problems), and one potential way around this is using quantum computers to simulate nuclear systems instead of classical computers (\"The best model of a cat is another cat, the best model of a quantum system is another quantum system\") If you're interested in learning more about QC, I would highly recommend looking at Nielsen and Chuang's \"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\", it's essentially the standard primer on the world of quantum computation. reply",

As far as security, that's not even the consideration I had in mind, sure wireguard is secure, but that's not why you should have vxlan inside it, you should do so because that's the purpose of wireguard, to connect networks securely across security/trust boundaries. it doesn't even matter if the other protocol is also wireguard, or ssh or whatever, if it is an option, wireguard is always the outermost protocol, if not then ipsec, openvpn,softether,etc..whatever is your choice of secure overlay network protocol gets to be the tunnel protocol. reply",

I have my Wireguard tunnel set up so that only traffic intended for hosts that are in the Wireguard network itself are routed over the Wireguard tunnel. I mostly use it to ssh into different machines. The Wireguard server runs on a VPS on the Internet, and I can connect to it from anywhere (except from networks that filter Wireguard traffic), and that way ssh into my machines at home while I am away from home. Whereas all other normal traffic to other places is unaffected by and unrelated to the tunnel. So for example if I bring my laptop to a coffee shop and I have Wireguard running and I browse the web with a web browser, all my web browsing traffic still gets sent the same normal way that it would even if I didn’t have the tunnel running. I rarely use NFS nor SMB, but if I wanted to connect either of those I would be able to that as well over this Wireguard setup I have. reply",

          "text": "If a situation where production vxlan is going over Wireguard arises, then someone in leadership failed to plan and the underlying Wireguard tunnel is coping with that failure. No doubt, OP already knows this and all too well. The problem is no doubt a people problem. I have learned to overcome these people problems by adhering to specific kinds of communication patterns (familiar to Staff Engineers and SVPs). There is no reason that Wireguard over vxlan over Wireguard can't work, even with another layer (TLS) on top of Wireguard. Nonetheless it is very suboptimal and proprietary implementations of vxlan tend to behave poorly in unexpected conditions. We should remember that vxlan is next-get vlan. The type of Wireguard traffic encapsulated within the vxlan that comes to mind first is Kubernetes intra/inter-cluster pod-to-pod traffic. But this Wireguard traffic could be between two legacy style VMs. If I were the operator told \"you need to securely tunnel this vxlan traffic between two sites\" I would reach for IPsec instead of Wireguard in an attempt to not lower the MTU of encapsulated packets too much. Wireguard is a layer 4 (udp) protocol intended to encapsulate layer 3 (ipv6 and legacy ip) packets. If I were the owner of the application I would bake mutual TLS authentication on QUIC with \"encrypted hello\" (both elliptic and PQ redundant) into the application. The applications would be implemented in Rust, or if not practicable to implement the application in Rust I would write into the Helm chart a sidecar that does such a mutual TLS auth part (in Rust of course). I would also aggressively \"ping\" in some manner through the innermost encapsulation layer. If I had tenancy on a classic VM doing Wireguard over the vxlan I would have \"ping -i 2 $remote_inside_tunnel_ipv6\" running indefinitely. reply",

          "text": "I use vxlan on top of wireguard in my hobby set up. Probably wouldn't recommend it for an actual production use-case. But that is more or less because of how my homelab is setup (Hetzner -> Home about 20ms latency roundtrip). I considered dropping my root wireguard and setting up just vxlan and flannel, but as I need NAT hole punching I kind of need the wireguard root so that is why i ended up with it. Going Wireguard inside the vxlan (flannel) in my case, would likely be overkill, unless I wanted my traffic between nodes between regions to be separated from other peers on the network, not sure where that would be useful. It is an easy way of blocking out a peer however, but that could just as well be solved on the \"root\" wireguard node. There might be some MTU things that would be messed up going nested wireguard networks. reply",

          "text": "You can see my reply below: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46609044 I believe our setups are pretty equivalent. I achieve load balancing by running native wireguard on a vps at hetzner, I've got a native wireguard mesh, I believe Talos can do the same, where the peers are manually set up, or via. tailscale etc. I then tell k3s that it should use the wireguard interface for vxlan, and boom my kubernetes mesh is now connected. flannel-iface: \"wg0\" # Talos might have something similar. I do use some node-labels and affinities to make sure the right pods end up in the right spot. For example the metallb annoucer always has to come from the hetzner node. As mentioned in my reply below, it takes about 20ms roundtrip back to my homelab, so my sites can take a bit of time to load, but it works pretty well otherwise, sort of similar to how cloudflare tunnels would work, except not as polished.

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

          "text": "I work mostly with the old microcontroller-based cheap consumer (\"GDI\") USB models circa 2000-2010, these are hardly possible to brick with software, as some of them even don't have a firmware and expect the PC to upload it on each power on sequence. The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately. There's ongoing work on modern (driverless) printer behavior emulation, but it is under heavy development and not ready yet: https://github.com/OpenPrinting/go-mfp Nothing for the older printers and scanners which require it's own driver, of what I'm aware. reply",

          "text": "Working on Yomu, an indie iOS Japanese reader intended to make intermediate reading easier. It started while I was studying for JLPT N4 — I wanted adaptive furigana that hides readings for kanji I already know, so I could focus on real text without constant lookups. That shaped the core architecture: level-based furigana, offline dictionary (JMDict), and custom tokenization logic with IPADic for accuracy. Some interesting challenges have been furigana edge cases, Safari text paste quirks, and balancing offline performance with accuracy. Yomu is live on the App Store now, and I’m writing about the problems that led me to build it on my blog: https://blog.kulman.sk/japanese-reading-problem/ . reply",

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

I admit my knowledge of CHERI is superficial and have not spent too much time reading the specs until I can play with off-the-shelf CPUs that support it.

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

It has a procedurally-generated open world with towns and NPCs to talk to, all the resource gathering, mining, crafting stuff you'd expect in a modern survival game, and some good old fashioned dungeon crawling to boot.

As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

My best thoughts always came to me at inconvenient times like when I was on the subway or with friends. So about a year and a half ago I hacked together a journaling solution for myself. I set up a Twilio phone number, a server to receive the messages, logged the message to a txt file, and committed it to a GitHub repo. It was extremely simple, but it worked surprisingly well for me. The friction was low enough that I actually used it every day... and I had perfectly timestamped journal entries with full version control.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m trying to understand a discrepancy between Lichess’s analysis board and my own Stockfish setup.<p>On Lichess (browser-based analysis), Stockfish reports close to 1 MN/s on my Redmi Note 14 Pro. However, when I run Stockfish locally via a Python program using the native executable, I only see around 600 kN/s.<p>What’s confusing is that despite the higher reported speed, Lichess takes about 2:30 to reach depth 30, while my local setup reaches depth 30 in about 53 seconds, even though it reports a lower N/s. Lichess also appears much more “active” in terms of frequent evaluation updates.<p>I suspect this has to do with how N/s is measured or displayed (instantaneous vs average), differences in search configuration (continuous search vs restarts, MultiPV, hash reuse), or overhead from the way the engine is driven (e.g., UI or I/O throttling). It also raises the question of whether “depth 30” is directly comparable across different frontends.<p>Has anyone looked into how Lichess reports Stockfish speed, or why a setup showing higher N/s can still take significantly longer to reach the same nominal depth?</p></p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m reaching out here because I’ve hit a wall that feels insurmountable and I am looking for genuine perspective from people who might have navigated systemic barriers.<p>I have a Master’s in Computer Science from a European university and a research background with papers totaling over 500 citations. In my spare time, I’m a builder and I’ve developed web apps, games, and various side projects. On paper, I should have a solid career path, but my reality is the opposite.<p>I am currently back in my home country in the East due to circumstances I couldn't control. Despite my credentials, my degree feels useless here. I work at a decent-sized western company (fully remote), but the internal politics are volatile and I fear for my job security. More painfully, I feel a deep sense of prejudice; in daily professional conversations, I can hear the tone shift when people realize where I am based. It feels like I am watching others reap what I have sown, while my own investments in skills and projects feel futile.<p>The core of my problem is twofold:<p><pre><code>    Geographic and Legal: The jobs I am actually qualified for are almost exclusively in the West, but there is no current legal path for me to migrate or secure a living there.\n\n    The Trust Gap: Despite the citations and my portfolio, I lack the \"signal\" that makes international recruiters or local employers trust my expertise. It feels like I'm \"cursed\" by my place of birth.\n</code></pre>\nI have stretched myself so thin trying to build products that don't gain traction, and I’ve reached a point where I feel like learning to code was a mistake. I love building things, but it isn’t putting food on the table or providing a future. I feel lost and, honestly, pretty devoid of hope.<p>For those who have been stuck in \"low-trust\" geographies or faced extreme systemic barriers despite having high-level skills:<p>How do you bridge the trust gap with Western companies when relocation isn't an option? Are there specific niches (Remote-first R&amp;D, specialized consulting, etc.) where academic citations and a builder mindset actually carry weight?<p>I am looking for any genuine suggestions on how to leverage what I have to secure a life that doesn't feel impossible.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">The pain point I hear from plugin authors more than anything lately is \"discoverability.\" It's not a new problem, but this new AI-driven landscape complicates it a bunch.<p>A while back I saw this LinkedIn post by Rand Fishkin. It revisits an old-school idea: brand mentions. Specifically, mentioning your brand right next to the same words everywhere on the web you can. And those words should be the pain point you solve. That tactic feels very relevant again because of how ChatGPT and other LLMs learn from public conversations.<p>People are trying to stop saying SEO and start saying things like AEO, LLMO…The term that makes the most sense to me is \"Discovery Optimization\"<p>Discovery doesn’t just happen in search results. It happens in forums, communities, product pages, and word of mouth. That’s how humans find things, and increasingly how AI does too.<p>So! I’m running a small experiment with my new free plugin: Synced Pattern Popups. I’m sharing the exact same clear value statement in as many credible, free places as I can. No rewriting per platform. Just clarity and consistency.<p>This is the line I’m using everywhere:\n“Synced Pattern Popups helps you create popups using the WordPress editor you already know, not yet another builder.”<p>I hear this constantly from plugin authors: “I shipped my free plugin, but I’ve been stuck under 10 active installs for months. What now?”<p>I’ve got plenty of theories, but nothing beats hands-on experience. So I’m testing this in public and seeing what actually moves the needle in this AI-shaped environment we all inherited.<p>So the question is: Is this how you do it? Do you all think this will gain any traction for a tiny free plugin? Looking forward to your feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

So since this year is just starting out and I have a KP insurance I decided to understand what am I missing out on. I realized there's a lot. I had no clue that lot of preventive visits, tests are offered for free generally. I decided to then make up a custom GPT just for me to continue understanding it and have it give me a rough timeline of preventive test/visits that I should be doing this quarter. I ended up booking an appointment yesterday and have rough plan for this month which is going to cost me little to nothing. Have you thought about this?<p>Edit: All I initially had was a 100 page doc of my benefits that I never looked at by virtue of being lazy. So I dumped this in and gave it a task to optimize for cost and preventive tests.</p></div>",

          "text": "> The risk tends to show up more with non-experts This hits a key point that isn't emphasised enough. A few interactions with technology and people have shaped my view: I fiddled with Apple's Image Playground thing sometime last year, and it was quite rewarding to see a result from a simple description. It wasn't exactly what I'd asked for, but it was close, kind of. As someone who has basically zero artistic ability it was fun to be able to create something like that. I didn't think much about it at the time, but recently I thought about this again, and I keep that in mind when seeing people who are waxing poetic about using spicy autocomplete to \"write code\" or \"analyse business requests\" or whatever the fuck it is they're using it for. Of course it seems fucking magical and fool proof if you don't know how to do the thing you're asking it for, yourself. I had to fly back to my childhood home at very short notice in August to see my (as it turned out, dying) father in hospital. I spoke to more doctors, nurses and specialists in two weeks, than I think I have ever spoken to about my own health in 40+ years). I was relaying the information from doctors to my brother via text message. His initial response to said information was to send me back a Chat fucking GPT summary/analysis of what I'd passed along to him... because apparently my own eyeballs seeing the physical condition of our father, and a doctor explaining the cause, prognosis and chances of recovery were not reliable enough. Better ask Dr Spicy Autocomplete for a fucking second opinion I guess. So now my default view about people who choose to use spicy autocomplete for anything besides shits and giggles like \"Write a Star Trek fan fiction where Captain Jack Sparrow is in charge of DS9\", or \"Draw <my wife> as a cute little bunny\" is essentially \"yeah of course it looks like infallible magic, if you don't know how to do it yourself\". reply",

This is why governance can’t be an afterthought.
