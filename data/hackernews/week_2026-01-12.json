          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret. - OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly. OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch. Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

We built it after working in the industry and seeing families struggle a lot with navigating the complex aged care system (at a time in their lives which is already very stressful). It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these. Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey. The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective). One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db. reply",

We’re taking a local-first approach with electric as a sync engine. All interactions against our own apis are instant with optimistic updates. Making the app feel more like a native app rather than the typical web app. Taking this approach has lead to some interesting challenges, both in technical and product areas. Some features requires third party roundtrips (summaries, labelling, embedding etc..) which breaks the \"instant\" system. We’re experimenting with ways to design those flows so the system still feels fast. Currently we only have one \"loading\" request in the entire system. Having all data available on the client has also lead to some neat benefits. No need to compose or build your typical GET endpoints in the API. You just query the client DB directly!

The way I see it is that I can just text my assistant bot and ask it something like \"hey, can you research which NAS setup would be the best for me given x and y\". It will offer some setup and I would say \"can you add it to the plan\" and \"can you plan the next steps for me?\". The bot will also update the knowledgebase and version control it. You might also want to use it for something like planning a trip to Paris, where at some point you might say \"hey, given my schedule, can you squeeze a tour to top5 croissant places in the center of Paris\". The whole thing sound really vague and sounds like something solved long ago, but I cannot find solutions that will be guaranteed to stick to a very precise plan that I can review at any given moment.

          "text": "VersionAlert: https://versionalert.com For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get. It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful. https://riffradar.org/ reply",

Things like manually reconciling data between billing, support, and ops, or preparing the same reports in slightly different formats for different stakeholders. These processes usually start small and “temporary,” but scale quietly as the company grows. The trade-off is that they’re hard to automate cleanly because ownership isn’t always clear. Curious whether the pain you’re seeing is more about fragmented data or about human approval loops that automation alone doesn’t fully eliminate? reply",

In some large businesses I've worked in, so many people have been hired that some systems and processes have wound up being controlled by entirely different people from the people who need them. So coordination between people and waiting for people who have little to no incentive to do the thing they're being asked to takes up a large part of the working day. 2. In other businesses, a large fraction, or even a large majority of the employees have had no discernible job except to talk and write about the job performed by the few people doing an actual job. So a lot of time in these businesses would be spent dodging meeting invitations, rejecting grand ideas about revolutionizing the business with AI on the blockchain, saying no to \"if you could X, that'd be great\" and generally reminding people that they're not in charge. The great thing about these problems is that you're not very likely to have them in a small startup, but if you decide to grow the organization later, you'll need to be very vigilant about how you scale. reply",

          "text": "I recently wrote a command-line full-text search engine [1].  I needed to implement an inverted index.  I choose what seems like the \"dumb\" solution at first glance: a trie (prefix tree). There are \"smarter\" solutions like radix tries, hash tables, or even skip lists, but for any design choice, you also have to examine the tradeoffs.  A goal of my project is to make the code simpler to understand and less of a black box, so a simpler data structure made sense, especially since other design choices would not have been all that much faster or use that much less memory for this application. I guess the moral of the story is to just examine all your options during the design stage.  Machine learning solutions are just that, another tool in the toolbox.  If another simpler and often cheaper solution gets the job done without all of that fuss, you should consider using it, especially if it ends up being more reliable.

          "text": "Before I started the project, I was already vaguely familiar with the notion of an inverted index [1].  That small bit of knowledge meant that I knew where to start looking for more information and saved me a ton of time.  Inverted indices form the bulk of many search engines, with the big unknown being how you implement it.  I just had to find an adequate data structure for my application. To figure that out, I remember searching for articles on how to implement inverted indices.  Once I had a list of candidate strategies and data structures, I used Wikipedia supplemented by some textbooks like Skiena's [2] and occasionally some (somewhat outdated) information from NIST [3].  I found Wikipedia quite detailed for all of the data structures for this problem, so it was pretty easy to compare the tradeoffs between different design choices here.  I originally wanted to implement the inverted index as a hash table but decided to use a trie because it makes wildcard search easier to implement. After I developed most of the backend, I looked for books on \"information retrieval\" in general.  I found a history book (Bourne and Hahn 2003) on the development of these kind of search systems [4].  I read some portions of this book, and that helped confirm many of the design choices that I made.  I actually was just doing what people traditionally did when they first built these systems in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with more modern tools and much more information on hand. The harder part of this project for me was writing the interpreter.  I actually found YouTube videos on how to write recursive descent parsers to be the most helpful there, particular this one [5].  Textbooks were too theoretical and not concrete enough, though Crafting Interpreters was sometimes helpful [6].

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been mostly anti AI. I did experiment a bit with aider and free models, but my results were inconsistent, and nothing to worry about.<p>However, recently I have purchased the max plan from anthropic and have been vibing with Claude code since then. And wow, the results are very good. With a good enough prompt, and planning step, it could generate full features in a project with 20k LOC, with very little modifications needed by me after review.<p>I heard even more success stories from friends who gave Claude 3-4 different features that Claude would develop in parallel.<p>On top of that, everyone seems to produce side project at an astronomical rate, both among my friends, and here on HN where fully complete project that would take months to develop, seem to appear after few hours with Claude code.<p>So, my questions is, is programming as a profession cooked? Are most of us going to be replaced with a “supervisor” who runs coding agents all day?</p></p></p></p></div>",

We can take our hands off the steering wheel for longer stretches of time, this is true, but if you have production apps with real users that spend real money then going to sleep at the wheel is far too risky. Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product. The profession is changing, no doubt about it. But its obsolescence is probably decades away. reply",

          "text": "My ancient background in Lotus Notes dev offers a different perspective than most. Yep, it is a hated platform now, but back in its heyday, it had similar business impact to what we are seeing from LLMs now. Non-tech folk could whip out basic CRUD apps in a few minutes without knowing how to code. And they did. Those apps worked well for trivial functions, when not scaled beyond a small userbase. Yet when people got one right that solved a real problem in an effective way, the userbase stated to scale, the warts in the apps became apparent, the original creator could not keep up with the changes needed, and those of us who were professionals would get called in to re-create the whole thing to a professional standard. I really see the same thing at our current level of AI. People are whipping out basic apps that work for small problems that are solved by small solutions. And it works. But without professionals intervening and correcting all the small problems along the way, it doesn't scale. Professional software engineers still need to exist to be sure that the solutions being created are scalable. Will we spend as much time typing out specific lines of code? Probably not. But will the jobs still be there? Absolutely. Perhaps even with more variety because we can focus more on the actual problems being solved. We will do more take-over work of apps that people got started but cannot finish. We'll refactor apps that got coded into corners, and spend more time talking directly to customers to understand what we are really trying to accomplish. It will be different work, but it will be there. reply",

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

If this is what you're discussing, I have no worries - automation taking a significant portion of jobs, including software engineering, is a huge worry. The other thing is this almost schadenfreude of intelligence. The argument goes something like, if AGI is a superset of all our intellectual, physical, and mental capabilities, what point is there of humans? Not from an economic perspective, but literally, a \"why do humans exist\" perspective? It would be \"rational\" to defer all of your thinking to a hyperintelligent AGI. Obviously. The latter sentiment I see a decent bit on hackernews. You see it encoded in psychoanalytic comments like, \"Humans have had the special privilege of being intelligent for so long, that they can't fathom that something else is more intelligent than them.\" For me, the only actionable conclusion I can see from a philosophy like this is to Lie Down and Rot. You are not allowed to use your thinking, because a rational superagent has simply thought about it more objectively and harder than you. I don't know. That kind of thinking, be it from intuitively when I was in my teens, to learning about government and ethics (Rational Utopianism, etc.) has always ticked me off. Incidentally, every single person who's thought that way unequivocally, I've disliked. Of course, if you phrase it like this, you'll get called irrational and quickly get compared to not so nice things. I don't care. Compare me all you want to unsavory figures, this kind of psychoanalytic gaslighting statement is never conducive to \"good human living\". Don't care if the rebuttal analogy is \"well, you're a toddler throwing a tantrum, while the AGI simply moves on\". You can't let ideologies like the second get to you. reply",

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs.

But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule.

But not one cares about my programming in C on mainframes in the 90s) including 2 leading AWS architecture at a startup and 3.5 working directly at AWS (full time consulting division). After being Amazoned for shits and giggles I randomly applied for hundreds of jobs that I was qualified for - I heard crickets.  I never do this and I didn’t expect much to come from it. I did her multiple offers in a couple of weeks via my network and targeted outreach to recruiters where I was an industry expert in a niche of AWS that’s popular.  But not many people have experience with. On another note, the mid size company I work for sent around 300 offers last year and we had an offer/application rate of 0.4%.

Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p></div>",

I imagine it could even work like Sponsorblock does, and we could crowdsource people who's comments are inflammatory. I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt.

It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though.

I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

Researched it substantially and realized it's an unsolved problem. Anything that makes a dent is incomplete and comes with ugly tradeoffs. For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online.

However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network.

          "text": "\"10 parallel agents\" was just one guy with access to unlimited credits. Most of us are on Max plan or API plan, and cant afford to burn credits. He can just run the agents just to show that he is running 10 parallel agents. As an avg dev, what I can even do with 10 agents? It like managing 10 toddlers who can code, it looks good but it becomes hard to manage as you have limited context in your brain. 2 is the best setup if you can afford. One can write Tests and other can write the code. This is better because if you just use the same agent instance, its not gonna be able to write good tests as it will just write tests that its code is gonna pass. Its different for everyone else, but for me, 2 is the best setup for TDD. Apart from that, you can just go ahead and do it your own way. I have found that many senior engineers think they are special when they can make Claude Code do something, they think its with their setup but I am usually able to replicate without any setups or Agents.md/Claude.md, the models are good enough without any complex setup. reply",

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

Except, it's just a repo organisation system (structure, conventions, and tools) that lets me share common \"parts\" across multiple \"projects\". No monolithic frameworks here. Libraries are functions. Apps are objects. However, normally, we use these as distinct artefacts, eventually leading to the \"diamond dependency\" problem (and lots of other annoying development-time stuff caused by libs / code that is \"over there\" (elsewhere)).

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

          "text": "Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours. claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these. Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey. The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective). One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db. reply",

Many indie artists perform there and have followings, and that is just one potential site to share your work. Sure, to become a household name you gotta grow from there and it is a tough road, but the ability to put out your music is crazy stronger today than in days of yore.

          "text": "I recently wrote a command-line full-text search engine [1].  I needed to implement an inverted index.  I choose what seems like the \"dumb\" solution at first glance: a trie (prefix tree). There are \"smarter\" solutions like radix tries, hash tables, or even skip lists, but for any design choice, you also have to examine the tradeoffs.  A goal of my project is to make the code simpler to understand and less of a black box, so a simpler data structure made sense, especially since other design choices would not have been all that much faster or use that much less memory for this application. I guess the moral of the story is to just examine all your options during the design stage.  Machine learning solutions are just that, another tool in the toolbox.  If another simpler and often cheaper solution gets the job done without all of that fuss, you should consider using it, especially if it ends up being more reliable.

          "text": "Before I started the project, I was already vaguely familiar with the notion of an inverted index [1].  That small bit of knowledge meant that I knew where to start looking for more information and saved me a ton of time.  Inverted indices form the bulk of many search engines, with the big unknown being how you implement it.  I just had to find an adequate data structure for my application. To figure that out, I remember searching for articles on how to implement inverted indices.  Once I had a list of candidate strategies and data structures, I used Wikipedia supplemented by some textbooks like Skiena's [2] and occasionally some (somewhat outdated) information from NIST [3].  I found Wikipedia quite detailed for all of the data structures for this problem, so it was pretty easy to compare the tradeoffs between different design choices here.  I originally wanted to implement the inverted index as a hash table but decided to use a trie because it makes wildcard search easier to implement. After I developed most of the backend, I looked for books on \"information retrieval\" in general.  I found a history book (Bourne and Hahn 2003) on the development of these kind of search systems [4].  I read some portions of this book, and that helped confirm many of the design choices that I made.  I actually was just doing what people traditionally did when they first built these systems in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit with more modern tools and much more information on hand. The harder part of this project for me was writing the interpreter.  I actually found YouTube videos on how to write recursive descent parsers to be the most helpful there, particular this one [5].  Textbooks were too theoretical and not concrete enough, though Crafting Interpreters was sometimes helpful [6].

I ended up writing a small release tag driven generator: it walks git tags, collects merged PRs between releases, buckets them into categories, and renders Markdown/MDX grouped by year -&gt; month -&gt; category -&gt; version. I also added an optional LLM step that outputs structured JSON via Pydantic schema for PR bullets that includes monthly summaries. It is idempotent and preserves manual edits or omissions, so you can auto-generate, then curate over time.<p>I’m curious what works for you in practice:<p>- Towncrier?<p>- reno?<p>- GitHub Releases / auto-generated notes?<p>- something else?<p>What do you like/hate about your current setup? Any tools you’d recommend?<p>If anyone wants to see the script I wrote, I am happy to share it and would love some constructive feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Full disclosure, I’m one of the owners of ReleaseNotes.io. Not trying to pitch, just sharing what we see across a lot of teams. 1. For OSS projects, GitHub Releases honestly work really well. You usually have contributors who understand the context, and readers who are technical enough to parse a changelog. 2. If you're talking to users, Release notes stop being a dev artifact and become a communication channel. They need to show up where users already are, in-app, email, Slack, etc. There are a bunch of tools like us (ReleaseNotes.io), LaunchNotes, AnnounceKit, Canny and others that help with that. 3. From what we see, the teams that have the most success with automation of this process treat GitHub PRs or Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, GitHub issues as the source of truth. Also their issues/PR descriptions tend to clearly describe the problem and the solution. 4. Any automation of this process leans heavily on the quality of your issue/PR descriptions as garbage-in = garbage-out. Because of this it's tricky to fully automate the process as at some level you usually need a person casting an eye over the release note just to sense check. reply",

When I first started looking for a release notes strategy, I was considering towncrier for that exact reason. You are also right that commit messages are not intended for the consumer of the release, but a dialogue between developers. Your points are well received and largely why I went PR-based (title/body with optional GitHub metadata) instead of commit-based. A PR title and body tend to be focused on the deliverable, whereas commit messages are narrowly focused on the code change at that moment with developers as the intended audience. Re: git-cliff, I honestly hadn’t evaluated this one, but it looks solid for commit-driven changelogs. I like the rationale behind conventional commits being parsable and templates enforcing consistency. What constraints pushed you toward git-cliff vs writing release notes by hand, and do you have a config/template you have found works well for surfacing breaking changes? reply",

          "text": "I run a small team building Dreamlux.ai (AI video generation). AI changed my day-to-day in a few concrete ways: Coding: I write less boilerplate and more “integration glue”. LLMs are great for scaffolding (Next.js routes, workers, SQL migrations) and translating logs/errors into hypotheses. Biggest win is speed from idea → working PR, not perfect code. Debugging/ops: I paste real production symptoms (headers, cache status, curl repros, traces) and ask for ranked root-cause candidates + experiments. This reduced “blind poking” a lot, especially around CDN caching rules, 429s, image optimization, and edge-case billing/credits. Planning/reviews: We now require “AI-assisted PR reviews” to include: risk list, test plan, rollback steps, and what metrics should move. It’s basically a checklist generator + reviewer #2. Humans still make the call. What stuck: ChatGPT + a copilot in editor for daily work; LLM as a “rubber duck” for incident triage and for turning messy notes into specs. What felt like hype: autonomous agents that “own” features end-to-end. Without tight scopes, they wander; with tight scopes, they’re just faster scripts. The sweet spot is human-led, AI-accelerated loops. Curious: for managers, what’s your best process change that AI enabled (not just “wrote code faster”)? reply",

Copilot for code completion + reviews or small snippets/functions but larger code/module generation has been weak so far. Claude for full modules generation or complex multi-file edits. Research: Grok (less filtered + better search), Claude (complex dev topics), GPT (balanced but sometimes slanted and/or seems to favor certain sources). My Teams: Mostly Copilot for code completion/reviews, mix of GPT/Claude for code. Last year was loose/experimental to learn but we plan to formalize guidelines more this quarter.

          "text": "That’s not necessarily true. I went from a sys admin role to swe through a rather chill process with no one really pushing. The sys admin job had a lot of downtime, so I started automating some stuff to make my life easier. Then improved upon that stuff to make it more robust to share with the team. Then at some point my boss told me to just work on whatever I thought would help the team, and do that (officially ending the sys admin work that I had largely stopped doing on my own many months earlier). He didn’t really talk to me for 2 years after that. By that time, I had so many projects that I couldn’t do them all myself and he ended up building a whole team around me. Everything went at my pace. Since it was all value-add of stuff that otherwise wouldn’t exist, there were no timelines or pressure. However, I enjoyed it, so I was working 60 hour weeks most of the time, but it all felt very chill. No one was asking me to put in those hours and a good deal of it was more social. As a result, I saw the biggest jumps in salary in my career, while at the same time having the lowest stress, and most enjoyment from my job. But all this started in an office after I had a good deal of time with the company. I didn’t walk into it as a new hire. These days I feel like I have more stress, but don’t feel like I’m growing at all, because there is no room for exploration and growth with all the deadlines and shifting priorities that have me never knowing which direction to go or when the direction with drastically change. For me, growth happens when I’m bored. It’s a way to avoid the boredom. When I’m pushed too hard, I tend not to grow, I shutdown. The best way for a company to get the most out of me is to stick me in a room and let me get bored, as counterintuitive as that sounds. reply",

Your job should be manageable day-to-day with certain period of stress or extra work where you need to push yourself. This is where growth occurs. Example: You need to learn a new language/framework and maybe spend some extra hours outside of work for a few weeks to ramp up for a new project. But once you have a handle on it, you go back to your regular schedule. And that might even mean now you can relax and work less than your regular schedule. It's all about managing when you grind and when you \"coast\". reply",

And wow, the results are very good. With a good enough prompt, and planning step, it could generate full features in a project with 20k LOC, with very little modifications needed by me after review.<p>I heard even more success stories from friends who gave Claude 3-4 different features that Claude would develop in parallel.<p>On top of that, everyone seems to produce side project at an astronomical rate, both among my friends, and here on HN where fully complete project that would take months to develop, seem to appear after few hours with Claude code.<p>So, my questions is, is programming as a profession cooked? Are most of us going to be replaced with a “supervisor” who runs coding agents all day?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "My ancient background in Lotus Notes dev offers a different perspective than most. Yep, it is a hated platform now, but back in its heyday, it had similar business impact to what we are seeing from LLMs now. Non-tech folk could whip out basic CRUD apps in a few minutes without knowing how to code. And they did. Those apps worked well for trivial functions, when not scaled beyond a small userbase. Yet when people got one right that solved a real problem in an effective way, the userbase stated to scale, the warts in the apps became apparent, the original creator could not keep up with the changes needed, and those of us who were professionals would get called in to re-create the whole thing to a professional standard. I really see the same thing at our current level of AI. People are whipping out basic apps that work for small problems that are solved by small solutions. And it works. But without professionals intervening and correcting all the small problems along the way, it doesn't scale. Professional software engineers still need to exist to be sure that the solutions being created are scalable. Will we spend as much time typing out specific lines of code? Probably not. But will the jobs still be there? Absolutely. Perhaps even with more variety because we can focus more on the actual problems being solved. We will do more take-over work of apps that people got started but cannot finish. We'll refactor apps that got coded into corners, and spend more time talking directly to customers to understand what we are really trying to accomplish. It will be different work, but it will be there. reply",

What I think will actually happen is that a new breed of programmers with extensive mathematical background will start designing unprecedented software (or even digital circuits through high-level synthesis) that are almost correct by construction at a much faster rate with the combination of formal specification and AI coding. The field of computer aided design (CAD) will likely explode, and we will witness spaceships, nanobots, etc. being churned out at the rate of React websites. The whole computing field will become so high level that applied mathematics like optimal control, optimal transport, information geometry, etc. will become bread and butter for any programmer. At the same time, there will be a new breed of artists that starts making games, movies, etc. with AI alone. We will witness a whole new form of artistic expression. reply",

We can take our hands off the steering wheel for longer stretches of time, this is true, but if you have production apps with real users that spend real money then going to sleep at the wheel is far too risky. Programmers will become the guardians and sentinels of the codebase, and their programming knowledge and debugging skills will still be necessary when the AI corners itself into thorny situations, or is unable to properly test the product. The profession is changing, no doubt about it. But its obsolescence is probably decades away. reply",

          "text": "Coding, or software engineering? Because the answer to each is different. As engineers, we can be the supervisor, doing code review, managing things at a higher level. Instead of choosing which libraries to do the work for us, we choose which LLM to write that code and we make sure those tests are all good and we insist they fix the failures they gloss over. As coders… well, right now it's only \"mostly\" taking over that, because there are still cases where the AI has no idea what it's doing, where it can* get the syntax right but the result is still useless. One example of this I've been trying recently is having an LLM do music generation**, both with \"give me a python script to make a midi file\" and Strudel ( https://strudel.cc ), and at this task it sucks much much worse than GPT-2 did with dungeon text adventures. I'm always on the lookout for the failure modes, because those failure modes are going to be my employment opportunities going forwards. Right now, if you're a coder who knows something else besides just coding, I think you can do useful work with the intersection that a lot of other coders without that side-interest would fail at even with LLM assistance. On the other hand, if your only side-interests are other forms of code, e.g. you want to make a game engine and a DSL for that game engine, but you're not fussed about writing any games with either, then you probably won't do well. * \"can\", not \"will always\" like we're used to in other domains. ** \"why not use Suno?\" I imagine you asking. Where Suno works well I like it, but it also has limits. Ask it for something outside its training domain… I've tried getting a 90 second sequence of animal noises with no instruments, it made something 140 seconds long consisting of only instruments and no animal noises. reply",

If this is what you're discussing, I have no worries - automation taking a significant portion of jobs, including software engineering, is a huge worry. The other thing is this almost schadenfreude of intelligence. The argument goes something like, if AGI is a superset of all our intellectual, physical, and mental capabilities, what point is there of humans? Not from an economic perspective, but literally, a \"why do humans exist\" perspective? It would be \"rational\" to defer all of your thinking to a hyperintelligent AGI. Obviously. The latter sentiment I see a decent bit on hackernews. You see it encoded in psychoanalytic comments like, \"Humans have had the special privilege of being intelligent for so long, that they can't fathom that something else is more intelligent than them.\" For me, the only actionable conclusion I can see from a philosophy like this is to Lie Down and Rot. You are not allowed to use your thinking, because a rational superagent has simply thought about it more objectively and harder than you. I don't know. That kind of thinking, be it from intuitively when I was in my teens, to learning about government and ethics (Rational Utopianism, etc.) has always ticked me off. Incidentally, every single person who's thought that way unequivocally, I've disliked. Of course, if you phrase it like this, you'll get called irrational and quickly get compared to not so nice things. I don't care. Compare me all you want to unsavory figures, this kind of psychoanalytic gaslighting statement is never conducive to \"good human living\". Don't care if the rebuttal analogy is \"well, you're a toddler throwing a tantrum, while the AGI simply moves on\". You can't let ideologies like the second get to you. reply",

Bank reconciliation seems simple - two lists, match them - but then you hit timing differences where something cleared on different dates in each system, or description mismatches where the bank shows \"PAYPAL *ACME\" but you recorded \"Acme Ltd - Invoice 4521\". Transaction categorisation is arguably worse because there's no universal standard. What one accountant calls \"Office Expenses\" another puts in \"General Admin\" - both correct for their context. Any automation that works for one client's books tends to break when you switch to another. reply",

In some large businesses I've worked in, so many people have been hired that some systems and processes have wound up being controlled by entirely different people from the people who need them. So coordination between people and waiting for people who have little to no incentive to do the thing they're being asked to takes up a large part of the working day. 2. In other businesses, a large fraction, or even a large majority of the employees have had no discernible job except to talk and write about the job performed by the few people doing an actual job. So a lot of time in these businesses would be spent dodging meeting invitations, rejecting grand ideas about revolutionizing the business with AI on the blockchain, saying no to \"if you could X, that'd be great\" and generally reminding people that they're not in charge. The great thing about these problems is that you're not very likely to have them in a small startup, but if you decide to grow the organization later, you'll need to be very vigilant about how you scale. reply",

I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership?

I've also noticed that very obviously LLM-generated comments are called out, and the community tends to agree, but those that have any plausible deniability are given far too much leniency, and people will over-index on the guidelines to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't think a captcha is the solution, as it'll degrade conversation by an OOM though. reply",

I only learned about it after I asked via a non-public channel, with evidence. Otherwise I wouldn't have known, and I suspect most users are unaware. What I cited in previous comment is also from a non-public conversations. If I'm wrong and it's documented publicly in rules or users are notified when it happens to them, I'm happy to be corrected, link? reply",

It's a waste of time to read those comments, at least for me. Wouldn't hurt them if they lost my attention. I am not bothered by it enough to vibe code a browser extension for it, though.

Do you want a ranking system where more the people downvote some person, the better? if so how do you prevent spam in that, do you take metrics like karma or what exactly? I don't think that captcha is a solution either but also that I don't know how to feel about removing entire swaths of people, I can think someone writing something bad once and probably get into this \"black-list\" Another aspect is once again the black list, I don't know but do we really need a system of essentially a communal ban? The only thing I can see it reasonable is if there is a slop bot comment poster but I rarely face this issue but if you do, you can probably create a tampermonkey script and tampermonkey scripts work on chrome,firefox and \"Userscripts\" which should work on safari as well and that script is most likely gonna be compatible on both tampermonkey and userscripts. reply",

For a time I wondered if I should try and solve it myself, but I could never think any solution that hadn't already been/being tried. Years later I'm left curious if it's even possible to solve the problem. My point is that captcha won't solve this, and solving this problem is a lot harder than it seems at first, and might not even be solvable (which I know is hard to accept). If someone does find an elegant privacy ensuring way to solve it, I think the impact would extend far beyond HN and could make a big difference to the future of civilization as a whole. reply",

Second, systems could be designed to filter by score. For instance, if I'm researching products on reddit, I'd sure love to know A. it's a real person, and B. to filter by some score threshold. I'd wager people with higher scores have less incentive to get paid to shill some product online.

However, spending $10k for $200 in rewards… I don’t really care. That’s mostly a tool to get people to justify more spending. I’ve quite liked using the debit card and seeing the number go down when I spend, it makes more sense intuitively, and I always know exactly what I have. I had a debit card stolen about 20 years ago; I was able to get the charges reversed, no different from a credit card in my experience. It’s on the Visa network. I would cancel my last credit card, but I don’t want to deal with cell phone deposits and other nonsense, like I had to in the past. reply",

I have had very low cholesterol for 20 years, even though 70% of my calories are quality fats. never been an ounce overweight. constant 83Kg forever ketogenic diets are now prescribed as a no drug cure for Diabetes with very good research into Epilepsy. As well as the ketogenic diet, I have chosen all my life never eat any food that is squirted out of a machine (breakfast cereals etc). this includes all take away foods like macdonalds, pizza's, and bleached chicken companies. THIS FOOD IS NOT DESIGNED FOR HUMANS. I am a martial artist, aikido brown belt and shotokan orange belt. power walk 6 miles, three time a week, rain or shine. For mental well being, I cook organic food and bake sourdough breads for my local mental health charity and local church. This is for those less fortunate that need support. I never ever take any drugs that are prescribed by a doctor. I learned over 20 years as a psychotherapist that most GP's here in the UK, do not know all there is about the drugs they prescribe. Their prescribing decison are made from the sales brochures they receive and from pressure salesmen promoting the drugs from big pharma. The only medical people I trust are those that really matter. In particualar those who work in surgical practice. Surgeons in all fields are amazing. Now those people are the real life savers and know their stuff. Ive not watched the TV for 25 years, which in turn makes me autonomous, individual and self regulated. Unaffected by the manipulative brain washing propaganda of mass media companies. Being a linux (arch BTW) user also has its mental health benefits. less stress being the main one, and no poxy anti-virus or three days updates. I realised early on in my life that by giving more than you receive is the key to our own mental well being. For instance, I realised during my psychotherapy training that the people who needed psychotherapy the most, were the people who could not afford it. So I worked pro bono for 10 years as a volunteer psychotherapist and gave my time for free. reply",

          "text": "States like Iran have signal catchers, where they can get a rough idea where a signal is coming from through triangulation.  The US military has had this for over 20 years now.  Often these coordinates are fed in as targets into weapons systems. If you're going the radio route these come to mind: Meshtastic: 1W, one band, local.  Useful if Iran doesn't know about it.  But easy to jam and probably triangulate. Wifi Halow: 1W, can possibly hop between bands, but probably also really easy to jam and triangulate. WSPR:  Possibly good, transmitters can hide in the noise floor, and can go long distances with 100mW of power, but slow.  Probably triangulable, very easy to jam once located in the spectrum.   Data can be transmitted and received with off the shelf components. Military Radios:  Very good.  Transmitters can frequency hop, making triangulation and jamming difficult.  Also encryption.  You can easily transmit in the same frequency space that Iran would be using to avoid jamming.  But also, mostly unobtanium.  I have heard stories about US military radios showing up at Ham Fests. reply",

So the message might go the wrong direction, say.  Or, worse, a meshtastic radio in a basement might get priority. Because they didn't understand (or care about) network topologies from the start and reliable message transmission, not to mention the versions of devices that are still on their network,  I'm guessing it's gonna be a couple more years before they finally get their act together. reply",

          "text": "Couriers and USB flash drives can be pretty effective. They're high latency but can be very high bandwidth. Look at the El Paquete network in Cuba[0] as inspiration. Self-contained HTML/JavaScript SPAs can provide navigation and the likes of TiddlyWiki[1] can allow for collaboration. A network of couriers can move as fast as road traffic and distribute stuff pretty widely. Contents can be re-shared locally over ad-hoc or mesh WiFi networks even without Internet access. Encryption and steganography can obscure the contents of drives from casual inspection. You can stuff a lot of extraneous data in Office XML documents that are just zip files and look innocuous when opened. 1. For current events content add descriptions, locations, and timestamps to everything. The recipients need that context. 2. Even unencrypted files can be verified with cryptographic signatures. These can be distributed on separate channels including Bluetooth file transfers. 3. Include offline installers for browsers like Dillo or Firefox. Favor plain text formats where possible. FAT32 has the broadest support in terms of file system for the flash drives. Batch, PowerShell, and bash scripts can also be effective in doing more complex things while not needing local installation or invasive installations on people's computers.

So that it would work better with very high latency sneaker-net flash-drive networks?  Especially for the already asynchronous ones like email?  I could envision a user with a messenger/email-like client who \"sends\" (encrypted) messages that get put on a flash drive.  This is carried around the neighborhood, etc, where others do the same.  Eventually someone takes it to a machine with regular internet access, where the messages get delivered to their intended recipients.  And then replies to these messages (coming hours, days, weeks later) also get put on a flash drive, and maybe hopefully get back to the original receivers.  And if the internet-down situation has been resolved, the recipients will already have their messages, but if not, they'll get them when the flash drive arrives.

          "text": "There is no privacy in amateur radio. That is not a matter of preference, it is a regulatory and physical reality. Amateur radio transmissions are public, unencrypted, and attributable. Callsigns are required, modes and frequencies are well known, and transmissions are trivially direction-findable. In a country like Iran, where RF spectrum is actively monitored and unauthorized communications are treated as a security issue, transmitting on amateur bands is effectively broadcasting your location and intent. Direction finding is routine, fast, and does not require exotic equipment. One transmission can be enough. In the US and most other countries, amateur radio is tightly regulated. Encryption to obscure content is explicitly prohibited. Ignoring this can result in fines, seizure of equipment, and loss of license. Foreign operators encouraging or participating in such use are not insulated from consequences simply because the target country is authoritarian. I did not claim to have a better solution. That's the point. When the threat model includes surveillance, attribution, and enforcement, there may be no safe civilian workaround. Suggesting amateur radio in this context is not “imperfect but helpful”, it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what amateur radio actually is and how it is regulated. Amateur radio can't provide privacy, safety, or reliable information flow under an active crackdown. Pretending otherwise is irresponsible. reply",

Power on. Download Starlink app (iOS/Android) or use web interface. Connect phone/PC to Starlink Wi-Fi. Follow app prompts to activate (no subscription needed in Iran now). Meshtastic (LoRa mesh, long-range offline text):\nBuy compatible device (e.g., Heltec/RAK ESP32 LoRa board). Flash latest firmware via web flasher (meshtastic.org). Install Meshtastic app (Android/iOS). Connect via Bluetooth. Set region (e.g., EU433/US915 based on hardware). Create/join channel with shared key. Messages hop device-to-device. Noghteha (Bluetooth mesh, Iran-specific, offline):\nDownload Noghteha APK (Google Play or sideloading). Install on Android. Open app—no account needed. Enable Bluetooth. Messages auto-hop via nearby phones in mesh. Briar (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi P2P, offline secure messaging):\nDownload Briar APK (briarproject.org or F-Droid). Install on Android. Create account (nickname + password). Add contacts: meet in person and scan QR, or share link via other channel. Enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for sync when in range. Messages store & forward when devices meet. Delta Chat (email-based, works if any outbound email possible):\nDownload Delta Chat app (delta.chat). Use chatmail server for auto-account (no personal email needed). Or add existing email. Add contacts via QR/link. Send messages (E2EE). Relies on email transit; resilient to blocks if email partially works. Carrier pigeons: (communications w/ nearby states). Code Talkers:\nUse minority Iranian languages (e.g., Kurdish, Balochi, Azerbaijani) as codes for voice/radio comms, training speakers to encode military/civil strategies, similar to WWII code talkers—resilient if monitors lack fluency. Sci-fi alien languages (e.g., Klingon, Na'vi) could work if users learn them for encrypted messaging apps or calls, but impractical due to learning curve and detection risks in which case create your own code talker language with an AI. e.g.,\nStratCode System\nAlphabet: Use 10 simple symbols for phonetics (easy to draw/speak): ⊙ (oh) - Open circle for vowels like O/A.\n| (ih) - Line for I/E.\n△ (ah) - Triangle for A/U.\n× (kh) - X for hard consonants K/G.\n~ (sh) - Wave for S/Sh.\n□ (th) - Square for T/D.\n○ (eh) - Empty circle for E.\n/ (fh) - Slash for F/V.\n\\ (rh) - Backslash for R/L.

I have thoughts, ideas, projects, concepts, links, things to read... fired at my brain all day every day. I can go deep on a topic for hours, but then be hit by a barrage of micro ideas. I really struggle to stay on track and focus. Oh and I run a business, manage people, try to make a profit. It's hard. And kids. And life?<p>I think there is a founder/ADHD thing. Paul Graham thinks so. Maybe even a tech person angle. What have other people experienced?<p>And how do others cope? I don't really know this world. I do know that my old boss once called me a \"flagitating laser beam\". I think he meant distracted. I use a bunch of systems to cope. For a long time lists, and then Asana. Asana ruled my life. I just built my own thing to capture tasks, projects, but also knowlegde. Not sure if it will help we will see.<p>So tell me:<p>- Who else feels this way?\n- How do you manage?\n- Oh and how do you switch off? That is hard</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Most responses here are about systems and tools — which help, but they're compensations working around the issue rather than at it. The underlying problem is network regulation in the brain. Your Default Mode Network (the self-referential mind-wandering system) is supposed to quiet down when you engage in tasks. In ADHD, that toggle is unreliable — the DMN keeps intruding, which is why you get that \"barrage of micro ideas\" breaking through during focus. A few things that work at the root: Meditation — not as a relaxation tool, but as direct neuroplasticity training. Focused attention practice (noticing when your mind wandered, returning to object) is literally thousands of reps training that DMN/task-positive toggle. Long-term meditators show measurably better DMN suppression during tasks. Sleep — DMN regulation degrades hard with poor sleep. Non-negotiable foundation. The deeper move is changing your relationship to the thoughts themselves. The DMN will always generate ideas. The shift is recognizing them as arisings rather than commands. They still come — they just lose their grip. reply",

Anyone that tells you that you just need to try one \"trick\", a planner, a mindset change, default mode networks, \"try sleeping more\", whatever, can either never understand what it's like or is trying to sell you something. Or both. If someone neurotypical gives you advice, just smile and nod, and ignore it. If someone tells you ADHD is a \"superpower\" promptly ignore them. Unfortunately, this often applies to generalist doctors who don't specialise in ADHD. The reality is that there is no single thing that will help. You'll have to try shit and see what works for you. What one person swears \"fixed\" them might do nothing for you. That said, the one thing that is the most likely to work out is medication. Get yourself a diagnosis, try the meds, see if it helps.

I have a general to-do file and a tech todo file, and then notes.txt. When my notex.txt grows too long, which I define as having to scroll at all, I start to break it up. When I break it up, I personally use latex files. I know everyone loves markdown, but I'm not a fan of Obsidian (closed source and electron, ugh), so I fell in love with TexStudio. I have keybindings for simple macros to insert sections and subsections that I can quickly name, and these display in the navigation tree very well. TexStudio also allows multiple tex files open at once with a tabbedinterface, and allows saving sessions, so I can open one file to open all my, say, 'ai app ideas' notes. I've found this to work better for myself than any other available app or solution. Eventually, I'd like to release a fork which would mainly be trimming stuff out rather than really adding anything in, but it's far from a priority for me at the moment. reply",

I take Concerta and drink Coffee, but I mostly just enjoy the coffee. It's really hard to stay on track sometimes, it's really hard to go too long without working on something inherently interesting to me. I'm constantly late and prefer late nights, I tend to always have a bad sleep cycle. Really basic things that other people seem good at, I struggle. Taxes, finances, anything that requires ambient awareness of systems that have no clear feedback loops. Sometimes penalties  for trivial things accumulate and it costs a lot of money. Goals, unless they're  something like literally climbing a mountain, don't really motivate me. I don't have any financial or life goals at all, they seem artificial and silly. Without stimulants, and a thankfully somewhat lenient company/client atm, I'd be screwed. The positive is that I seem to be much better at making friends than most other people I know, and enjoy a variety of interesting hobbies. I'm also not that fearful or anxious about trying new things. In terms of who I listen to about the topic, it's certainly not any entrepreneur types, it's mostly friends. Though Trevor Noah has a great podcast on the topic last April https://pca.st/episode/19d903d2-bb2b-4213-837e-89a1af706ea0 Additionally, I cope by exclusion. I don't obligate myself to many things or events, and refuse to participate in group chats. I keep almost no notifications on, and people know that if they need my attention, they can just call me, otherwise I won't respond until I get around to it. I only buy gifts when I find inspiration to, and try not to spread myself too thin. I also try to avoid easy things as much as possible. I failed at easy assignments, easy exams in school, why bother going through the rote motions for no other purpose than to be measured on my performance in doing them? reply",

If you do have ADHD then I don't think you should expect of yourself to be \"fixed\" to match the \"average\" norm. You will still be thinking about random stuff (\"be creative\"), it just will be a bit less of an issue in doing what is important. What seems to work for me: * meds * writing everything down. This is not ADHD specific advice, I got it from GTD and it decreased anxiety. Just get used to the feeling that you will pull it out when you need it. I keep looking around for better solutions, but I no longer expect to have one that is perfect. Currently peeking back into Obsidian, for how flexible it is, but not abandoning OmniFocus and other tools I use. * I prioritize regular sleep, but I allow myself digging deep in a subject that interests me from time to time * physical work is surprisingly relaxing * AI is becoming very important to me in completing tasks which are complex enough for me to get bored/tired/overwhelmed before reaching the finish line. A micro idea is great if you can tell Claude to implement it and come back to you. Even better when it succeeds :) The shorter time from starting to reward of completing is great for delivering. * schedule some time for learning new stuff, otherwise you will become tired that it's all work and no fun * delegate taking into account where you struggle the most. You might feel bad since you are delegating the most difficult work, but it might actually by trivial to people with brains with no such issues. * not everything needs to be done, prioritize and don't worry about the less important stuff your brain throws at you * it's more about setting time blocks to focus on something than reaching a specific goal. An hour scheduled in the calendar for support emails, for development, for reading... * cheer up, we're entering the best period so far for people having ideas and you will have plenty * [BONUS EDIT] noise-cancelling headphones :) reply",

          "text": "First of all if you have the money get an official diagnosis. While self diagnosis is often right, ADHD symptoms can have overlap with many other things so it is better to be sure. Now want a quick fix? If you can, get medication. It doesn't work for all people with ADHD but for those that it does it will give you the most bang for the buck. Now there is coping strategies. Therapists can help a lot. There is also people offering ADHD coaching. This is great because the coaches tend to have ADHD themselves and understand you. It helped me personally a lot but be warned that everyone can offer coaching so quality may wary. Last part is lifestyle. Sport. It is not optional. Running is amazing and will help you a lot but if you are not fit enough yet, walk. Walk every day for at least 30min. You need to. Also personally for me reading a physical book for at least 30min a day makes a huge, huge difference. Diet is important but what works varies from ADHD person to person. For me cutting out processed sugar was a good step. Also no caffeine. This may also vary but completely cutting it helped me personally a lot. Yes, it helps somewhat with executive function but only in the short term and does more harm than good in the long term. Generally any form form of self medication be it alcohol, weed and so on, cut it out. Again get proper medication if you can. Honestly accepting that you have ADHD or well at least some form of neurodivergency is already the biggest step. It gets so much easier once you learn how to properly manage it. reply",

The meds (Vyvanse) help somewhat, but the real key to improvement for me has been using Todoist. IME the real trick is using it consistently, and for everything. My routines (e.g. morning routine: meds, eat, coffee, brush teeth, brush the dog's teeth, etc etc) are all in Todoist, not because I struggle to focus on getting that stuff done in the morning (well, sometimes, perhaps) but because starting the day with do-easy-thing, mark-it-done, repeat, sets up the rest of the day to be run by Todoist instead of the bit of my brain that goes \"I know we should be getting ready to leave but WHAT IF YOU WROTE AN APP TO DO THIS COOL THING, JUST QUICKLY TRY THAT NOW, YOU CAN LEAVE AFTER\". I had a similar experience with org-mode too. It was great at work where I'm at my desk all day, and made a huge difference, but not having a good mobile experience makes it impractical for day-to-day home use. reply",

I don't take stimulants beyond caffeine, I meditate most days at least once a day, which I find helpful, as well as not stay up too late. I keep a pad of paper by my bed to capture ideas. Working to music seems to help. If you get a lot of ideas, you should reconcile yourself to only acting on a small fraction of them and worry less about all of the possibilities. I try to take care to keep the commitments that I make, writing them down and tracking them. And here it is important to keep a close track. I may be less impaired than you are, although many people have noticed I seem to get a lot of ideas. I collaborated with a partner on a book once, and at one point, about halfway through, he was frustrated with me and said, \"You are a geyser of ideas. We don't need more ideas, we need to complete what we set out to do.\" reply",

I also get a lot worse if I am letting a lot of tasks build up and I bounce around between them. Ultimately what worked for me was developing the ability to not react to something crossing my mind. Like in your example right when the micro idea would cross my mind after going deep, I'd just let that micro thought have a few seconds to pass through my mind, and not react to it. I wouldn't give into the thought \"I need to start doing this micro project!\" or have any kind of reaction. Once the immediate reaction passed I would decide whether it's worth changing my focus. This can also be used in the inverse, if I decide to go deep on something, periodically checking in to see if it's still worth going vs asking for help/input. reply",

Pages and pages of notes -- both to write an idea down to move away from it and as a way to make sure I do a task. It's way easier for me to accomplish something if I can obsessively plan it out in advance, and it's way easier to stop rolling an idea around in my head if I jot it down (potentially to be never entertained again.) It's a later step after diagnosis, but my doctor told me I'd be surprised at how effective medication can be. They were 100% right. It's not a cure all and it's not without potential side effects, but it makes me sad that it took me so long to approach my primary doctor about the issues. But as a side note, the medical info I've read makes a pretty firm statement that there is no late developing ADHD. One if the diagnostic criteria is that the symptoms occurred during childhood. Coping and your environment may affect the disorder's effect on your life, but it's with you for your life. _However_, adult diagnosis is very real. Your environment changes so much as you age, and it may or may not make ADHD worse.

You need to be able to record, triage, filter, prioritize, and execute on anything you need to remember. If any one of those stages is leaky you won't trust it and it won't last. My entire life is structured around managing it. I have to have very strong discipline. House must be spotless. Desk must be spotless. Try to work in the same place at the same time every day. Environmental and contextual stability is huge. Your brain must associate a particular desk, chair, place with doing the most important things. If you allow yourself to goof off or do other things in that place you are losing the fight. Working out fixes a lot for me too. I workout or my mood and motivation falls apart. Move or die. Again, consistency is key. Everything I do around environment is to reduce the need to use executive function. It is finite and fickle for people with ADHD. The more you have to think and convince yourself to do things the less likely you are to do them. You need consistent cues. \"Sit down here, start timer, means work on main thing and nothing else.\" If you can have discipline at all of these external things, the work can just happen and there is a kind of freedom in that. Program outlets. Give yourself set, specific time to explore the sidetracking. Don't tell your brain no. Tell it \"later\". It helps if you know there is time for the extra thoughts. That there is a relief valve. Also, drugs. I use prescribed stimulants. There are some unpleasant negative things, but I can function with them and life is better with them. But it isn't some magical cure. You still have to be organized and willing to work on your tasks or you will just be really focused on things you don't really need to be doing. I could write so much more, but that is some top of mind stuff that I think sits at the top of my hierarchy of being productive. Oh and you may need to have some conversations with future you. How is future you, a week, month, year from now going to feel if you burned a lot of time on side quests? reply",

It's worth talking to a doctor and getting the ball rolling on a formal diagnosis. ADHD is not the only diagnosis with those symptoms. For instance bipolar and autism spectrum disorder. Again, not a doctor, take that with a grain of salt. There are probably new tactics you can adopt in this thread, and they may help and are worth trying. Advice which is actionable today is valuable. But if this is severe enough to disrupt your life, the best strategy is a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes (eg exercise). Easier said than done, I know. I have my own issues I'm struggling with and I get it. I'm in the midst of trying that same three pronged approach. Please also understand that these diagnosis do not all have the same consequences for not treating them. If you don't want to pursue formal diagnosis and treatment, that is your right, but I would urge you to investigate whether or not you are bipolar in any case. If you have your first manic episode, and you don't understand that is what is happening, it could be dangerous. What you're describing sounds more like ADHD to me personally but is not inconsistent with hypomania either. Again, not a doctor, grain of salt. reply",

Are the Classical Computation models i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation</a> applicable? What other new models have been invented?<p>2) Quantum Computers: What is the Physics, Organization and Architecture of these? In classical computers you have semiconductor physics, electronic elements and voltage thresholds mapping to logical 1's and 0's. This is then used to build layers of abstractions. What are their equivalents in a quantum computer?  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing</a> has a lot of info. but not quite structured for understanding.<p>3) Quantum Programming: A lot is mentioned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming</a>  and Amazon lists a bunch of books on this topic but am not quite clear on how everything fits.\nAlso as i understand, quantum computing/programming can be simulated on classical hardware but am not clear on the how.<p>PS: Some detailed examples as to how quantum computers/programming actually help you solve problems which cannot be solved on classical computers would be helpful to bring everything together. Shor's algorithm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm</a>) is often mentioned but perhaps starting with a far simpler example would be more accessible.<p>PPS: In particular; I would love to hear from folks who actually study/research/work in this domain regarding what they actually do, its real-world applicabilities and how to go about learning the subject.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

If you don't have the equivalent of an undergrad CS/math/physics degree (with some linear algebra), it may be better to start with gentler sources. One such gentler source is the free online text I wrote with Andy Matuschak -- https://quantum.country .  I'm sure there are others which are very good, but perhaps that's helpful! Both books focus on foundations of the field, and don't cover recent innovations -- the book with Ike Chuang is 26 years old!  Still, many of the foundations have remained quite stable. reply",

For computers/architecture, think of qubits as noisy analog components and error correction as how digital reliability is built on top. Preskill’s NISQ notes are very clear here. For programming, most work is circuit construction and simulation on classical hardware (Qiskit, Cirq). That’s normal and expected.

          "text": "I worked at one of the quantum computing co's on their compiler stack (so pretty much pure classical compute stuff), but in order to have even a baseline understanding of the computations and programming using qubits, I had to first get a better intuition for the underlying quantum mechanics at play. This was a great introduction to the physics underpinning the computations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP... It's long, and the subject matter is intimidating at times, but watch, re-watch, then go deep by finding papers on subjects like superposition and entanglement, which are the key quantum phenomena that unlock quantum computing. It also helps to understand a bit about how various qubit modalities are physically operated and affected by the control systems (e.g. how does a program turn into qubit rotations, readouts, and other instruction executions). Some are superconducting chips using electromagnetic wave impulses, some are suspending an ion/atom and using lasers to mutate states, or photonic chips moving light through gates - among a handful of other modalities in the industry and academia. IBM's Qiskit platform may still have tooling, simulators, and visualizers that help you write a program and step through the operations on the qubit(s) managed by the program: https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit reply",

          "text": "For learning the theory behind quantum computing, I usually recommend Watrous's lecture notes [1] - they start out by immediately giving a helpful analogy to ordinary probabilistic computation. The online tutorial [2] is a good followup, especially if you want to understand  Clifford gates / stabilizer states, which are important for quantum error correction. If you have a more theoretical bent, you may enjoy learning about the ZX-calculus [3] - I found this useful for understanding how measurement-based quantum computing is supposed to work.

          "text": "1) Generally the two models of QC are the digital/circuit model (analogous to digital logic gates, with some caveats, such as reversibility of operations, no-cloning theorem), and analog computation (tuning the parameters of a continuous-time quantum system in your lab such that the system produces useful output) 2) The physics/architecture/organization depends heavily on the type of computer being discussed. In classical computing, one \"type\" of computer has won the arms race. This is not yet the case for quantum computers, there are several different physical processes through which people are trying to generate computation, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, photonics, quantum dots, neutral atoms, etc. 3) There are several ways that you can simulate quantum computation on classical hardware, perhaps the most common would be through something like IBM's Qiskit, where you can keep track of the degrees of freedom of the quantum computer throughout the computation, and apply quantum logic gates in circuits. Another, more complicated method, would be something like tensor network simulations, which are efficient classical simulators of a restricted subset of quantum states. 4) In terms of research, one particularly interesting (although I'm biased by working in the field) application is quantum algorithms for nuclear/high energy physics. Classical methods (Lattice QCD) suffer from extreme computational drawbacks (factorial scaling in the number of quarks, NP-Hard Monte Carlo sign problems), and one potential way around this is using quantum computers to simulate nuclear systems instead of classical computers (\"The best model of a cat is another cat, the best model of a quantum system is another quantum system\") If you're interested in learning more about QC, I would highly recommend looking at Nielsen and Chuang's \"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\", it's essentially the standard primer on the world of quantum computation. reply",

As far as security, that's not even the consideration I had in mind, sure wireguard is secure, but that's not why you should have vxlan inside it, you should do so because that's the purpose of wireguard, to connect networks securely across security/trust boundaries. it doesn't even matter if the other protocol is also wireguard, or ssh or whatever, if it is an option, wireguard is always the outermost protocol, if not then ipsec, openvpn,softether,etc..whatever is your choice of secure overlay network protocol gets to be the tunnel protocol. reply",

I have my Wireguard tunnel set up so that only traffic intended for hosts that are in the Wireguard network itself are routed over the Wireguard tunnel. I mostly use it to ssh into different machines. The Wireguard server runs on a VPS on the Internet, and I can connect to it from anywhere (except from networks that filter Wireguard traffic), and that way ssh into my machines at home while I am away from home. Whereas all other normal traffic to other places is unaffected by and unrelated to the tunnel. So for example if I bring my laptop to a coffee shop and I have Wireguard running and I browse the web with a web browser, all my web browsing traffic still gets sent the same normal way that it would even if I didn’t have the tunnel running. I rarely use NFS nor SMB, but if I wanted to connect either of those I would be able to that as well over this Wireguard setup I have. reply",

          "text": "If a situation where production vxlan is going over Wireguard arises, then someone in leadership failed to plan and the underlying Wireguard tunnel is coping with that failure. No doubt, OP already knows this and all too well. The problem is no doubt a people problem. I have learned to overcome these people problems by adhering to specific kinds of communication patterns (familiar to Staff Engineers and SVPs). There is no reason that Wireguard over vxlan over Wireguard can't work, even with another layer (TLS) on top of Wireguard. Nonetheless it is very suboptimal and proprietary implementations of vxlan tend to behave poorly in unexpected conditions. We should remember that vxlan is next-get vlan. The type of Wireguard traffic encapsulated within the vxlan that comes to mind first is Kubernetes intra/inter-cluster pod-to-pod traffic. But this Wireguard traffic could be between two legacy style VMs. If I were the operator told \"you need to securely tunnel this vxlan traffic between two sites\" I would reach for IPsec instead of Wireguard in an attempt to not lower the MTU of encapsulated packets too much. Wireguard is a layer 4 (udp) protocol intended to encapsulate layer 3 (ipv6 and legacy ip) packets. If I were the owner of the application I would bake mutual TLS authentication on QUIC with \"encrypted hello\" (both elliptic and PQ redundant) into the application. The applications would be implemented in Rust, or if not practicable to implement the application in Rust I would write into the Helm chart a sidecar that does such a mutual TLS auth part (in Rust of course). I would also aggressively \"ping\" in some manner through the innermost encapsulation layer. If I had tenancy on a classic VM doing Wireguard over the vxlan I would have \"ping -i 2 $remote_inside_tunnel_ipv6\" running indefinitely. reply",

          "text": "I use vxlan on top of wireguard in my hobby set up. Probably wouldn't recommend it for an actual production use-case. But that is more or less because of how my homelab is setup (Hetzner -> Home about 20ms latency roundtrip). I considered dropping my root wireguard and setting up just vxlan and flannel, but as I need NAT hole punching I kind of need the wireguard root so that is why i ended up with it. Going Wireguard inside the vxlan (flannel) in my case, would likely be overkill, unless I wanted my traffic between nodes between regions to be separated from other peers on the network, not sure where that would be useful. It is an easy way of blocking out a peer however, but that could just as well be solved on the \"root\" wireguard node. There might be some MTU things that would be messed up going nested wireguard networks. reply",

          "text": "You can see my reply below: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46609044 I believe our setups are pretty equivalent. I achieve load balancing by running native wireguard on a vps at hetzner, I've got a native wireguard mesh, I believe Talos can do the same, where the peers are manually set up, or via. tailscale etc. I then tell k3s that it should use the wireguard interface for vxlan, and boom my kubernetes mesh is now connected. flannel-iface: \"wg0\" # Talos might have something similar. I do use some node-labels and affinities to make sure the right pods end up in the right spot. For example the metallb annoucer always has to come from the hetzner node. As mentioned in my reply below, it takes about 20ms roundtrip back to my homelab, so my sites can take a bit of time to load, but it works pretty well otherwise, sort of similar to how cloudflare tunnels would work, except not as polished.

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

          "text": "I work mostly with the old microcontroller-based cheap consumer (\"GDI\") USB models circa 2000-2010, these are hardly possible to brick with software, as some of them even don't have a firmware and expect the PC to upload it on each power on sequence. The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately. There's ongoing work on modern (driverless) printer behavior emulation, but it is under heavy development and not ready yet: https://github.com/OpenPrinting/go-mfp Nothing for the older printers and scanners which require it's own driver, of what I'm aware. reply",

          "text": "Working on Yomu, an indie iOS Japanese reader intended to make intermediate reading easier. It started while I was studying for JLPT N4 — I wanted adaptive furigana that hides readings for kanji I already know, so I could focus on real text without constant lookups. That shaped the core architecture: level-based furigana, offline dictionary (JMDict), and custom tokenization logic with IPADic for accuracy. Some interesting challenges have been furigana edge cases, Safari text paste quirks, and balancing offline performance with accuracy. Yomu is live on the App Store now, and I’m writing about the problems that led me to build it on my blog: https://blog.kulman.sk/japanese-reading-problem/ . reply",

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

I admit my knowledge of CHERI is superficial and have not spent too much time reading the specs until I can play with off-the-shelf CPUs that support it.

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

It has a procedurally-generated open world with towns and NPCs to talk to, all the resource gathering, mining, crafting stuff you'd expect in a modern survival game, and some good old fashioned dungeon crawling to boot.

As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine. That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity . The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck. If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat. reply",

My best thoughts always came to me at inconvenient times like when I was on the subway or with friends. So about a year and a half ago I hacked together a journaling solution for myself. I set up a Twilio phone number, a server to receive the messages, logged the message to a txt file, and committed it to a GitHub repo. It was extremely simple, but it worked surprisingly well for me. The friction was low enough that I actually used it every day... and I had perfectly timestamped journal entries with full version control.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m trying to understand a discrepancy between Lichess’s analysis board and my own Stockfish setup.<p>On Lichess (browser-based analysis), Stockfish reports close to 1 MN/s on my Redmi Note 14 Pro. However, when I run Stockfish locally via a Python program using the native executable, I only see around 600 kN/s.<p>What’s confusing is that despite the higher reported speed, Lichess takes about 2:30 to reach depth 30, while my local setup reaches depth 30 in about 53 seconds, even though it reports a lower N/s. Lichess also appears much more “active” in terms of frequent evaluation updates.<p>I suspect this has to do with how N/s is measured or displayed (instantaneous vs average), differences in search configuration (continuous search vs restarts, MultiPV, hash reuse), or overhead from the way the engine is driven (e.g., UI or I/O throttling). It also raises the question of whether “depth 30” is directly comparable across different frontends.<p>Has anyone looked into how Lichess reports Stockfish speed, or why a setup showing higher N/s can still take significantly longer to reach the same nominal depth?</p></p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m reaching out here because I’ve hit a wall that feels insurmountable and I am looking for genuine perspective from people who might have navigated systemic barriers.<p>I have a Master’s in Computer Science from a European university and a research background with papers totaling over 500 citations. In my spare time, I’m a builder and I’ve developed web apps, games, and various side projects. On paper, I should have a solid career path, but my reality is the opposite.<p>I am currently back in my home country in the East due to circumstances I couldn't control. Despite my credentials, my degree feels useless here. I work at a decent-sized western company (fully remote), but the internal politics are volatile and I fear for my job security. More painfully, I feel a deep sense of prejudice; in daily professional conversations, I can hear the tone shift when people realize where I am based. It feels like I am watching others reap what I have sown, while my own investments in skills and projects feel futile.<p>The core of my problem is twofold:<p><pre><code>    Geographic and Legal: The jobs I am actually qualified for are almost exclusively in the West, but there is no current legal path for me to migrate or secure a living there.\n\n    The Trust Gap: Despite the citations and my portfolio, I lack the \"signal\" that makes international recruiters or local employers trust my expertise. It feels like I'm \"cursed\" by my place of birth.\n</code></pre>\nI have stretched myself so thin trying to build products that don't gain traction, and I’ve reached a point where I feel like learning to code was a mistake. I love building things, but it isn’t putting food on the table or providing a future. I feel lost and, honestly, pretty devoid of hope.<p>For those who have been stuck in \"low-trust\" geographies or faced extreme systemic barriers despite having high-level skills:<p>How do you bridge the trust gap with Western companies when relocation isn't an option? Are there specific niches (Remote-first R&amp;D, specialized consulting, etc.) where academic citations and a builder mindset actually carry weight?<p>I am looking for any genuine suggestions on how to leverage what I have to secure a life that doesn't feel impossible.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">The pain point I hear from plugin authors more than anything lately is \"discoverability.\" It's not a new problem, but this new AI-driven landscape complicates it a bunch.<p>A while back I saw this LinkedIn post by Rand Fishkin. It revisits an old-school idea: brand mentions. Specifically, mentioning your brand right next to the same words everywhere on the web you can. And those words should be the pain point you solve. That tactic feels very relevant again because of how ChatGPT and other LLMs learn from public conversations.<p>People are trying to stop saying SEO and start saying things like AEO, LLMO…The term that makes the most sense to me is \"Discovery Optimization\"<p>Discovery doesn’t just happen in search results. It happens in forums, communities, product pages, and word of mouth. That’s how humans find things, and increasingly how AI does too.<p>So! I’m running a small experiment with my new free plugin: Synced Pattern Popups. I’m sharing the exact same clear value statement in as many credible, free places as I can. No rewriting per platform. Just clarity and consistency.<p>This is the line I’m using everywhere:\n“Synced Pattern Popups helps you create popups using the WordPress editor you already know, not yet another builder.”<p>I hear this constantly from plugin authors: “I shipped my free plugin, but I’ve been stuck under 10 active installs for months. What now?”<p>I’ve got plenty of theories, but nothing beats hands-on experience. So I’m testing this in public and seeing what actually moves the needle in this AI-shaped environment we all inherited.<p>So the question is: Is this how you do it? Do you all think this will gain any traction for a tiny free plugin? Looking forward to your feedback.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

So since this year is just starting out and I have a KP insurance I decided to understand what am I missing out on. I realized there's a lot. I had no clue that lot of preventive visits, tests are offered for free generally. I decided to then make up a custom GPT just for me to continue understanding it and have it give me a rough timeline of preventive test/visits that I should be doing this quarter. I ended up booking an appointment yesterday and have rough plan for this month which is going to cost me little to nothing. Have you thought about this?<p>Edit: All I initially had was a 100 page doc of my benefits that I never looked at by virtue of being lazy. So I dumped this in and gave it a task to optimize for cost and preventive tests.</p></div>",

          "text": "> The risk tends to show up more with non-experts This hits a key point that isn't emphasised enough. A few interactions with technology and people have shaped my view: I fiddled with Apple's Image Playground thing sometime last year, and it was quite rewarding to see a result from a simple description. It wasn't exactly what I'd asked for, but it was close, kind of. As someone who has basically zero artistic ability it was fun to be able to create something like that. I didn't think much about it at the time, but recently I thought about this again, and I keep that in mind when seeing people who are waxing poetic about using spicy autocomplete to \"write code\" or \"analyse business requests\" or whatever the fuck it is they're using it for. Of course it seems fucking magical and fool proof if you don't know how to do the thing you're asking it for, yourself. I had to fly back to my childhood home at very short notice in August to see my (as it turned out, dying) father in hospital. I spoke to more doctors, nurses and specialists in two weeks, than I think I have ever spoken to about my own health in 40+ years). I was relaying the information from doctors to my brother via text message. His initial response to said information was to send me back a Chat fucking GPT summary/analysis of what I'd passed along to him... because apparently my own eyeballs seeing the physical condition of our father, and a doctor explaining the cause, prognosis and chances of recovery were not reliable enough. Better ask Dr Spicy Autocomplete for a fucking second opinion I guess. So now my default view about people who choose to use spicy autocomplete for anything besides shits and giggles like \"Write a Star Trek fan fiction where Captain Jack Sparrow is in charge of DS9\", or \"Draw <my wife> as a cute little bunny\" is essentially \"yeah of course it looks like infallible magic, if you don't know how to do it yourself\". reply",

This is why governance can’t be an afterthought.

          "text": "For vector generation I started using Meta-LLama-3-8B in april 2024 with Python and Transformers for each text chunk on an RTX-A6000. Wow that thing was fast but noisy and also burns 500W. So a year ago I switched to an M1 Ultra and only had to replace Transformers with Apple's MLX python library. Approximately the same speed but less heat and noise. The Llama model has 4k dimensions so at fp16 thats 8 kilobyte per chunk, which I store in a BLOB column in SQLite via numpy.save(). Between running on the RTX and M1 there is a very small difference in vector output but not enough for me to change retrieval results, regenerate the vectors or change to another LLM. For retrieval I load all the vectors from the SQlite database into a numpy.array and hand it to FAISS. Faiss-gpu was impressively fast on the RTX6000 and faiss-cpu is slower on the M1 Ultra but still fast enough for my purposes (I'm firing a few queries per day, not per minute). For 5 million chunks memory usage is around 40 GB which both fit into the A6000 and easily fits into the 128GB of the M1 Ultra. It works, I'm happy. reply",

          "text": "For the retrieval stage, we have developed a highly efficient, CPU-only-friendly text embedding model: https://huggingface.co/MongoDB/mdbr-leaf-ir It ranks #1 on a bunch of leaderboards for models of its size. It can be used interchangeably with the model it has been distilled from ( https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1... ). You can see an example comparing semantic (i.e., embeddings-based) search vs bm25 vs hybrid here: http://search-sensei.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (warning! It will download ~50MB of data for the model weights and onnx runtime on first load, but should otherwise run smoothly even on a phone) This mini app illustrates the advantage of semantic vs bm25 search. For instance, embedding models \"know\" that j lo refers to jennifer lopez. We have also published the recipe to train this type of models if you were interested in doing so; we show that it can be done on relatively modest hardware and training data is very easy to obtain: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12539 reply",

          "text": "Claude code / codex which internally uses ripgrep, and I'm unsure if it's using parallel mode. And, project specific static analyzers. Studies generally show when you do agentic retrieval w/ text search, that's pretty good. Adding vector retrieval and graph rag, so the typical parallel multi-retrieval followed by reranking, gives a bit of speedup and quality lift. That lines up with my local flow experience, where it is only enough that I want that for $$$$ consumer/prosumer tools, and not easy enough for DIY that I want to invest in that locally. For those who struggle with tools like spotlight running when it shouldn't, that kind of thing turns me off on the cost/benefit side. For code, I experiment with unsound tools (semgrep, ...) vs sound flow analyzers, carefully setup for the project. Basically, ai coders love to use grep/sed for global replace refactors and other global needs, but keeps tripped up on sound flow analysis. Similar to lint and type checking, that needs to be setup for a project and taught as a skill. I'm not happy with any of my experiments here yet however :( reply",

The real lightbulb moment is when you realise the ONLY thing a RAG passes to the LLM is a short string of search results with small chunks of text. This changes it from 'magic' to 'ahh, ok - I need better search results'. With small models you cannot pass a lot of search results ( TOP_K=5 is probably the limit ), otherwise the small models 'forget context'. It is fun trying to get decent results - and it is a rabbithole, next step I am going into is pre-summarising files and folders.

We built an internal RAG-based portal on top of our knowledge base (basically a much better FAQ). On the retrieval side, I built a custom search/indexing layer (Node) specifically for service traceability and discovery. It uses a hybrid approach — embeddings + full-text search + IVF-HNSW — to index and cross-reference our APIs, services, proxies and orchestration repos. The RAG pipelines sit on top of this layer, which gives us reasonable recall and predictable latency. Compliance and observability are still a problem. Every year new vendors show up promising audits, data lineage and observability, but none of them really handle the informational sprawl of ~600 distributed systems. The entropy keeps increasing. Lately I’ve been experimenting with a more semantic/logical KAG approach on top of knowledge graphs to map business rules scattered across those systems. The goal is to answer higher-level questions about how things actually work — Palantir-like outcomes, but with explicit logic instead of magic. Curious if others are moving beyond “pure RAG” toward graph-based or hybrid reasoning setups. reply",

More details about the project can be found in the README at &lt;https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io#readme&gt;.<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081 - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io</p></p></p></p></div>",

Oftentimes I find that in reading an explanation or report that ChatGPT gives me about a topic there will be small turns of phrase or even whole sentences that capture a concept way better than I can. I then feel obstinate not using a clearly superior option, so I'm curious if you've run into that tension and if so how you navigate it. reply",

Yes, I was not entirely happy with the restrictive wording either.  The original requirement was added mainly out of concern about spam submissions (blogspam, AI-generated content and similar).  But the quality of submissions has been surprisingly good and I am genuinely delighted by the number of interesting websites I have came across in the last few hours. So I have gone ahead and removed the overly restrictive criteria language. > Was hoping it would be a way to stumble upon potentially underrepresented content from folks in the hacker news community who don't normally get attention.

          "text": "I found out my crimson-bellied conure is laying an egg today! She's nesting in some towels now, chirping away while she works on laying it. Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds. She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute. I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me. She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :) So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with! Birds :) reply",

I don’t think it’s literally about flying. It’s about ignorantly complying to a status quo and how that itself is a decision even if you’ve made it unintentionally. Again I think the resources it takes to fly being a limitation are not what it’s referring to. A bird just lives its life in an area and never really assesses if a flight to a far off land is possible, if resources would support their journey, or any of that. They just do what all the other birds are doing or of course what their instincts tell them to. We’ve ignored migration and birds that do travel great distances as not a part of this as it’s not a literal statement about flying! reply",

          "text": "I got a handheld emulator console as a Christmas gift. Configuring shaders that emulate crt TVs, I realized I had no mental model of how those TVs worked at all. I’m used to “pixels are three little lights combining rgb colors”, which doesn’t work here, so I went on a rabbit hole and let me tell you, analog TVs are extremely impressive tech. Getting an electron beam to hit a glass, making the chemicals on it spark, covering it in a “reading motion” for hundreds of lines, and doing that 60 times a second! And the beam is oriented by just careful usage of magnets. It sounds super sci-fi for an already dead, 130 years old technology. I also learned that my childhood was a lie. Turns out that the logic in consoles of the time was tied to the speed of the beam, which in turn used alternating current’s frequency as a clock. This means that since European current changes 50 times per second rather than 60, our games played in slowmo (about 0.8x). American sonic was so much faster! And the music was so much more upbeat! reply",

          "text": "Teletext used the vertical blanking interval too. It consisted of numbered pages of text, each number input on the numpad on the remote control as a form of hypertext. Page after page was transmitted after one-another, repeatedly. It was sometimes used for subtitles, with some pages with a transparent background. Better receivers cached pages so you wouldn't have to wait for its next transmission when going to another page... Digital television formats adopted the framing from analogue formats and sends the same data in digital form within the vertical blanking interval. Many channels have stopped offering teletext. One network here in Sweden still uses it to deliver news, and I often prefer that format because the articles are concise and distraction-free. BTW.

The dish name is in quotes because it's really the English words \"Rice and Beans.\" Anyway, it's marvelous, and I couldn't wait to try making it myself at home. Unfortunately, so far, it's been a mushy flavorless mess. I'll try a third go tomorrow. What I have so far: - soften diced yellow onion and green bell pepper in 1 tbsp coconut oil - toss in 3 minced garlic cloves - toast 1.5 cups dry rinsed white rice in the mix - pour in 1 can coconut milk - add 1 can black beans (still looking for red beans) - add lots of fresh thyme - put in 1 whole habanero (still looking for Panamanian pepper) - add 1 tsp salt - add 1 can chicken broth - if you have it, add a tbsp of Linzo sauce Then simmer until the rice is cooked. Next time I'm going to try with fresh coconut milk straight from a real coconut. That's what I explored today: how to make coconut milk. Would appreciate advice on improving the recipe. reply",

What surprised me the most was that shiro (white) miso and aka (red) miso are both the same mix of soybeans, salt, and rice malt but fermented for different periods of time. As the miso ferments for longer, its color becomes darker while its flavor becomes milder and more complex. Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic. After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Most miso you can buy in a grocery store is created through forced fermentation over a few months, so if you ever get a chance to try naturally aged miso I would highly recommend! reply",

In my own experience, what is most rewarding and promotes my progress the most, is when I put philosophy into action.  Then I get authentic feedback from life about what actually works.  It helps me separate mere opinions and good sounding ideas from true insight. reply",

It's rather easy with physical books (or was, as we have little room left for even more books ;-0) but ebooks are  \"dangerous\" too. Regarding cameras, it's harder (and more expensive) to wrangle with gear acquisition syndrome (GAS) but after switching from Canon EOS to Fuji, because the Canon stuff was too heavy when hiking, I managed to restrain myself most of the time. Because the question always is whether my images would become better with different gear or with more trial and error. I opted for trial and error and eagerly watch a selected number of YouTube channels who almost always show me that I  should and can improve myself and not my gear. reply",

But ebooks are obviously \"worse\" in that regard. I loved when I found StandardEbooks.org and Gutenberg - all these classic books for free. But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing. With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself. There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those \"perfect\" images. When in fact nothing is keeping me from going out and shooting those \"perfect\" images with the camera I already have. reply",

At some points my flat gets up to about 1400, which the device says is bad, and sometimes it goes down as low as 500. I've noticed a pattern but can't quite connect that pattern to my activity or the surroundings. It starts going up around 4pm, which could be homewards-bound vehicles, but it seems to trend even on weekends when there is lower traffic. Maybe I start breathing differently at these times. I'm quite interested in getting to the bottom of it. Unfortunately I'm west facing so plant use is quite limited. What is the atmospheric ambient CO2 level? Is that variable based on location? I've learnt a few things: - I had my sensor on my work desk which meant the CO2 pooled, and was increased dramatically by my breathing almost directly onto it. Moved the sensor at least 1.5m - I had the sensor quite low down, where CO2 pools (being heavier), so moved the sensor to eye level - CO2 seemed to increase when cooking (same room), so while cooking I open the windows and let the warmth flow out of the building reply",

The Wikipedia article also references this concept of radical monopoly: > Tools for Conviviality also introduced Illich's idea of a 'radical monopoly', which describes a technology or service which becomes so exceptionally dominant that even with multiple providers, its users are excluded from society without access to the product. Which has extended to me wondering about what the world will look like as people are increasingly pushed to use LLMs or other AI tools in more and more interactions. And in particular, what actions can or should be taken to maximize human well-being. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality reply",

On round 2 their CTO basically shut me down 2 minutes in saying they're unwilling to do any sort of training and only looking for existing experts in their very specific niche. In round 1 the interviewer told me I seemed like a very good candidate, very positive about my experience. Said they'd been looking for a long while and I was one of the most experienced Go backend developers they'd interviewed. Round 1 was frankly one of the most positive interviews I'd ever had. Got extreme whiplash as round 2 was cut short at about the ten minute mark. I don't know for sure but I think a lot of companies are looking for an absolute Cinderella given the glut in applications.

The few I bought weren’t certified or anything, but they have lots of very well established sellers. I got a few bronze and silver coins from the Middle East and India. They were in good shape at about $10-20 US (plus international shipping). I also got some nicer Byzantine and Roman coins in the $50 US price range. I tried to group my orders from each seller to save on shipping. So far everything I’ve gotten is exactly as pictured, and the transactions have been very smooth. I got a couple more from a local dealer. The prices were a bit higher, but he was a lot of fun to talk to, which more than makes up for the price difference. reply",

It is pretty basic stuff I guess but not something you think about unless that is your jam. I was stress testing a server I made and noticed a discrepancy between two tests. In on test 15 virtual users could send 450msg/sec (not realistic I know) for about 6750 incoming messages per second. In another, 1000 users sending a message about every two seconds was the limit, about 500msg/sec incoming. Took me a little bit to figure out why, the outgoing messages between the tests were wildly different. In the smaller user tests the groups were about 3 on average, in the larger one they were 30. Group size is effectively a multiplier on incoming msg requests so when looking at the total traffic it was much closer between the two tests 15k and 20k. reply",

          "text": "I think the emerging best way is to do \"agentic search\" over files. If you think about it, Claude Code is quite good at navigating large codebases and finding the required context for a problem. Further, instead of polluting the context of your main agent, you can run a subagent to do search and retrieve the important bits of information and report back to your main agent. This is what Claude Code does if you use the keyword \"explore\". It starts a subagent with Haiku which reads ten of thousands of tokens in seconds. From my experience the only shortcoming of this approach right now is that it's slow, and sometimes haiku misses some details in what it reads. These will get better very soon (in one or two generations, we will likely see opus 4.5 level intelligence at haiku speeds/price). For now, if not missing a detail is important for your usecase, you can give the output from the first subagent to a second one and ask the second one to find important details the first one missed. I've found this additional step to catch most things the first search missed. You can try this for yourself with Claude Code: ask it to create a plan for your spec, and then pass the plan to a second Claude Code session and ask it to find gaps and missing files from the plan. reply",

If context gets too full (performance may degrade well before you hit LLM max context length), then the main remedy is to compact - summarize the old context and discard. One way to prevent this from being too disruptive is to have the agent maintain a TODO list tracking progress and what it is doing, so that it can better remain on track after compaction. reply",

          "text": "Every time you send a request to a model you're already providing all of the context history along with it. To edit the context, just send a different context history. You can send whatever you want as history, it's entirely up to you and entirely arbitrary. We only think in conversational turns because that's what we've expected a conversation to 'look like'. But that's just a very deeply ingrained convention. Forget that there is such a thing as 'turns' in a LLM convo for now, imagine that it's all 'one-shot'. So you ask A, it responds A1. But when you and B, and expect B1 - which depends on A and A1 already being in the convo history - consider that you are actually sending that again anyhow. Behind the scenes when you think you're sending just 'B' (next prompt) you're actually sending A + A1 + B aka including the history. A and A1 are usually 'cached' but that's not the simplest way to do it, the caching is an optimization. Without caching the model would just process all of A + A1 + B and B1 in return just the same. And then A + A1 + B + B1 + C and expect C1 in return. It just so happens it will cache the state of the convo at your previous turn, and so it's optimized but the key insight is that you can send whatever context you want at any time. If after you send A + A1 + B + B1 + C and get C1, if you want to then send A + B + C + D and expect D1 ... (basically sending the prompts with no responses) - you can totally do that. It will have to re-process all of that aka no cached state, but it will definitely do it for you. Heck you can send Z + A + X, or A + A1 + X + Y - or whatever you want. So in that sense - what you are really sending (if you're using the simplest form API), is sending 'a bunch of content' and 'expecting a response'. That's it. Everything is actually 'one shot' (prefill => response) and that's it. It feels conversational but structural and operational convention. So the very simple answer to your question is: send whatever context you want. That's it. reply",

Compaction always loses information, so I use an alternative approach that works extremely well, based on this almost silly idea — your original session file itself is the golden source of truth with all details, so why not directly leverage it? So I built the aichat feature in my Claude-code-tools repo with exactly this sort of thought; the  aichat rollover option puts you in a fresh session, with the original session path injected, and you use sub agents to recover any arbitrary detail at any time.  Now I keep auto-compact turned off and don’t compact ever. https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... It’s a relatively simple idea; no elaborate “memory” artifacts, no discipline or system to follow, work until 95%+ context usage. The tool (with the related plugins) makes it seamless: first type “>resume” in your session (this copies session id to clipboard), then quit and run aichat resume <pasted session id> And this launches a TUI offering a few ways to resume your work, one of which is “rollover”; this puts you in a new session with the original session jsonl path injected. \nAnd in the new session say something like, “There is a chat session log file path shown to you; Use subagents strategically to extract details of the task we were working on at the end of it”, or use the /recover-context slash command. If it doesn’t quite get all of it, prompt it again for specific details. There’s also an aichat search command for rust/tantivy based fast full text search to search across sessions, with a TUI for humans and a CLI/JSON mode for agents/subagents. The latter ( and the corresponding skill and sub agent) can be used to recover arbitrary detailed context about past work. reply",

This reduces the risk of missing key files, while increasing the risk of including marginally important files. An easy trade-off. Then I paste the subset of files into GPT 5.2 Pro, and give it $TASK. You could replace the upstream process with N codex sessions instead of N gemini chat windows. It doesn't matter.

What data would you need to create x screen, or y report? And then let it google it, or run queries on your data. I'll have it create markdown documents or skills to persist the insights it comes back with that will be useful in the future. LLMs are pretty good at plan/do/check/act: create a plan (maybe to run a query to see what tables you have in your database), run the query, understand the output, and then determine the next step. Your main goal should be to enable the PDCA loop of the LLM through tools you provide. reply",

These constraints result in token-hungry activity being confined to child scopes that are fully isolated from their parents.

Introspection tools for Cursor IDE — 47 read-only commands to inspect conversations, tool calls, context assembly, and agent reasoning from Cursor's internal SQLite databases. By Don Hopkins, Leela AI — Part of MOOLLM The Problem LLM agents are black boxes. You prompt, they respond, you have no idea what happened inside. Context assembly? Opaque. Tool selection? Hidden. Reasoning? Buried in thinking blocks you can't access. Cursor stores everything in SQLite. This tool opens those databases. The Science \"You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something.\" — Seymour Papert, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (Basic Books, 1980), p. 137 Papert's insight: metacognition requires concrete artifacts. Abstract introspection is empty. You need something to inspect. This connects to three traditions: Constructionism (Papert, 1980) — Learning happens through building inspectable artifacts. The Logo turtle wasn't about drawing; it was about making geometry visible so children could debug their mental models. cursor-mirror makes agent behavior visible so you can debug your mental model of how Cursor works. Society of Mind (Minsky, 1986) — Intelligence emerges from interacting agents. Minsky's \"K-lines\" are activation patterns that recall mental states. cursor-mirror lets you see these patterns: which tools activated, what context was assembled, how the agent reasoned. Schema Mechanism (Drescher, 1991) — Made-Up Minds describes how agents learn causal models through Context → Action → Result schemas. cursor-mirror provides the data for schema refinement: what context was assembled, what action was taken, what result occurred.

Currently only supports Cursor running on Mac, but I'd be happy to accept PRs for Linux and Windows support.

However, I find myself having to review every single command, a lot of which are repetitive. It still saves me a ton of time, but it's quickly becoming a bit tedious<p>I wish I could give the agent some more autonomy. Like giving it a list of pre-approved commands or actions that it is allowed to run over ssh<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    OK: ls, grep, cat, tail\n    Not OK: rm, mv, chmod, etc\n    OK: SELECT queries\n    Not OK: INSERT, DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE\n</code></pre>\nHas anyone successfully or satisfactorily solved this?<p>What setups have actually worked for you, and where do you draw the line between autonomy and risk?</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I am very passionate about this question - so much so that I happened make a blog post about it yesterday! I recommend giving LLMs credentials that are extremely fine-grained, where the credentials can only permit the actions you want to allow and not permit the actions you don't want to allow. Often, it may be hard or impossible to do this with your database settings alone - in that case, you can use proxies to separate the credentials the LLM/agent has from the credentials that are actually made to the DB. The proxy can then enforce what you want to allow or block. SSH is trickier because commands are mixed in with all the other data going on in the bytestream during your session. I previously wrote another blog post about just how tricky enforcing command allowlists can be as well: https://www.joinformal.com/blog/allowlisting-some-bash-comma... . A lot of developer CLI tools were not designed to be run by potentially malicious users who can add arbitrary flags! I also have really appreciated simonw's writing on the topic.

The tricky part is that even \"safe\" commands can be dangerous in combination or with certain arguments. `cat /etc/shadow`, `grep -r password`, or `tail -f` on the wrong log file.

Still not bulletproof, but removes the \"approve every ls command\" friction while keeping the obvious footguns out of reach. The mental model shift that helped: treat it less like \"allow/deny lists\" and more like designing a sandbox where the worst outcome is acceptable. If the agent can only read and the worst case is it reads something sensitive - that's a different risk profile than if it can write or delete. reply",

          "text": "For DB access, use an account with the correct access level you want to grant. For SSH, you can either use a specific account created for the AI, and limit it's access to what you want it to do, although that is a bit trickier than DB limits. You can also use something like ForceCommand in SSHD config (or command= in your authorized_keys file) to only grant access to a single command (which could be a wrapper around the commands you want it to be able to access). This does somewhat limit the flexibility of what the AI can deal with. My actual suggestion is to change the model you are using to control your servers. Ideally, you shouldn't be SSHing to servers to do things; you should be controlling your servers via some automation system, and you can just have your AI modify the automation system. You can then verify the changes it is making before committing the changes to your control system. Logs should be collected in a place that can be queried without giving access to the system (Claude is great at creating queries in something like ElasticSearch or OpenSearch). reply",

If we want it to be 100% safe, you probably don't ever do it with non-deterministic layers alone. - Creating tools and tool calling helps - Claude code specifically asks permissions to run certain commands in certain folders and keeps a list of that.  Chances are that is an actual hard filter locally when the llm recommends a command. This would be creating a deterministic layer to keep the non-deterministic layer honest.  This is mandatory because ai models don't return the same level of smarts and intelligence all the time. - Another step that can help is layering the incoming request and the command sent to the CLI between more layers and checks and no direct links to dilute any prompt injection, etc. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I ran into a practical limitation while working on ML feature engineering and multi-omics data.<p>At some point, the problem stops being “how many rows” and becomes “how many columns”.\nThousands, then tens of thousands, sometimes more.<p>What I observed in practice:<p>- Standard SQL databases usually cap out around ~1,000–1,600 columns.\n- Columnar formats like Parquet can handle width, but typically require Spark or Python pipelines.\n- OLAP engines are fast, but tend to assume relatively narrow schemas.\n- Feature stores often work around this by exploding data into joins or multiple tables.<p>At extreme width, metadata handling, query planning, and even SQL parsing become bottlenecks.<p>I experimented with a different approach:\n- no joins\n- no transactions\n- columns distributed instead of rows\n- SELECT as the primary operation<p>With this design, it’s possible to run native SQL selects on tables with hundreds of thousands to millions of columns, with predictable (sub-second) latency when accessing a subset of columns.<p>On a small cluster (2 servers, AMD EPYC, 128 GB RAM each), rough numbers look like:\n- creating a 1M-column table: ~6 minutes\n- inserting a single column with 1M values: ~2 seconds\n- selecting ~60 columns over ~5,000 rows: ~1 second<p>I’m curious how others here approach ultra-wide datasets.\nHave you seen architectures that work cleanly at this width without resorting to heavy ETL or complex joins?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "With genomics, your data is probably write ~once, almost entirely numeric, and is most likely used for single-client offline analysis. This differs a lot from what most SQL databases are optimizing for. My best experience has been ignoring SQL and using (sparse) matrix formats for the genomic data itself, possibly combined with some small metadata tables that can fit easily in existing solutions (often even in memory). Sparse matrix formats like CSC/CSR can store numeric data at ~12 bytes per non-zero entry, so a single one of your servers should handle 10B data points in RAM and another 10x that comfortably on a local SSD. Maybe no need to pay the cost of going distributed? Self plug: if you're in the single cell space, I wrote a paper on my project BPCells which has some storage format benchmarks up to a 60k column, 44M row RNA-seq matrix. reply",

I think the possible answer is to try to \"compress\" columns with custom datatypes, it could require to touch part of the innards of sql (like in postgreSQL you need to solve it with c) but is a viable option in many cases where you noted that what you could express in json, for example, is in fact a custom type that could be stored efficiently if there is a way to translate it to more primitive types, then solved that the indexes will work. The second option is to hide part of the join complexity with views. reply",

          "text": "States like Iran have signal catchers, where they can get a rough idea where a signal is coming from through triangulation.  The US military has had this for over 20 years now.  Often these coordinates are fed in as targets into weapons systems. If you're going the radio route these come to mind: Meshtastic: 1W, one band, local.  Useful if Iran doesn't know about it.  But easy to jam and probably triangulate. Wifi Halow: 1W, can possibly hop between bands, but probably also really easy to jam and triangulate. WSPR:  Possibly good, transmitters can hide in the noise floor, and can go long distances with 100mW of power, but slow.  Probably triangulable, very easy to jam once located in the spectrum.   Data can be transmitted and received with off the shelf components. Military Radios:  Very good.  Transmitters can frequency hop, making triangulation and jamming difficult.  Also encryption.  You can easily transmit in the same frequency space that Iran would be using to avoid jamming.  But also, mostly unobtanium.  I have heard stories about US military radios showing up at Ham Fests. reply",

So the message might go the wrong direction, say.  Or, worse, a meshtastic radio in a basement might get priority. Because they didn't understand (or care about) network topologies from the start and reliable message transmission, not to mention the versions of devices that are still on their network,  I'm guessing it's gonna be a couple more years before they finally get their act together. reply",

Self-contained HTML/JavaScript SPAs can provide navigation and the likes of TiddlyWiki[1] can allow for collaboration. A network of couriers can move as fast as road traffic and distribute stuff pretty widely. Contents can be re-shared locally over ad-hoc or mesh WiFi networks even without Internet access. Encryption and steganography can obscure the contents of drives from casual inspection. You can stuff a lot of extraneous data in Office XML documents that are just zip files and look innocuous when opened. 1. For current events content add descriptions, locations, and timestamps to everything. The recipients need that context. 2. Even unencrypted files can be verified with cryptographic signatures. These can be distributed on separate channels including Bluetooth file transfers. 3. Include offline installers for browsers like Dillo or Firefox. Favor plain text formats where possible. FAT32 has the broadest support in terms of file system for the flash drives. Batch, PowerShell, and bash scripts can also be effective in doing more complex things while not needing local installation or invasive installations on people's computers.

So that it would work better with very high latency sneaker-net flash-drive networks?  Especially for the already asynchronous ones like email?  I could envision a user with a messenger/email-like client who \"sends\" (encrypted) messages that get put on a flash drive.  This is carried around the neighborhood, etc, where others do the same.  Eventually someone takes it to a machine with regular internet access, where the messages get delivered to their intended recipients.  And then replies to these messages (coming hours, days, weeks later) also get put on a flash drive, and maybe hopefully get back to the original receivers.  And if the internet-down situation has been resolved, the recipients will already have their messages, but if not, they'll get them when the flash drive arrives.

          "text": "There is no privacy in amateur radio. That is not a matter of preference, it is a regulatory and physical reality. Amateur radio transmissions are public, unencrypted, and attributable. Callsigns are required, modes and frequencies are well known, and transmissions are trivially direction-findable. In a country like Iran, where RF spectrum is actively monitored and unauthorized communications are treated as a security issue, transmitting on amateur bands is effectively broadcasting your location and intent. Direction finding is routine, fast, and does not require exotic equipment. One transmission can be enough. In the US and most other countries, amateur radio is tightly regulated. Encryption to obscure content is explicitly prohibited. Ignoring this can result in fines, seizure of equipment, and loss of license. Foreign operators encouraging or participating in such use are not insulated from consequences simply because the target country is authoritarian. I did not claim to have a better solution. That's the point. When the threat model includes surveillance, attribution, and enforcement, there may be no safe civilian workaround. Suggesting amateur radio in this context is not “imperfect but helpful”, it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what amateur radio actually is and how it is regulated. Amateur radio can't provide privacy, safety, or reliable information flow under an active crackdown. Pretending otherwise is irresponsible. reply",

          "text": "Doubt that one solution alone will be enough to counter info blackout in any country. You need a combination of old and new strategies. Starlink (satellite, bypasses local infrastructure; currently jammed but partially works in some areas, free access offered):\nObtain smuggled terminal (dish + router). Place with clear sky view. Power on. Download Starlink app (iOS/Android) or use web interface. Connect phone/PC to Starlink Wi-Fi. Follow app prompts to activate (no subscription needed in Iran now). Meshtastic (LoRa mesh, long-range offline text):\nBuy compatible device (e.g., Heltec/RAK ESP32 LoRa board). Flash latest firmware via web flasher (meshtastic.org). Install Meshtastic app (Android/iOS). Connect via Bluetooth. Set region (e.g., EU433/US915 based on hardware). Create/join channel with shared key. Messages hop device-to-device. Noghteha (Bluetooth mesh, Iran-specific, offline):\nDownload Noghteha APK (Google Play or sideloading). Install on Android. Open app—no account needed. Enable Bluetooth. Messages auto-hop via nearby phones in mesh. Briar (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi P2P, offline secure messaging):\nDownload Briar APK (briarproject.org or F-Droid). Install on Android. Create account (nickname + password). Add contacts: meet in person and scan QR, or share link via other channel. Enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for sync when in range. Messages store & forward when devices meet. Delta Chat (email-based, works if any outbound email possible):\nDownload Delta Chat app (delta.chat). Use chatmail server for auto-account (no personal email needed). Or add existing email. Add contacts via QR/link. Send messages (E2EE). Relies on email transit; resilient to blocks if email partially works. Carrier pigeons: (communications w/ nearby states). Code Talkers:\nUse minority Iranian languages (e.g., Kurdish, Balochi, Azerbaijani) as codes for voice/radio comms, training speakers to encode military/civil strategies, similar to WWII code talkers—resilient if monitors lack fluency. Sci-fi alien languages (e.g., Klingon, Na'vi) could work if users learn them for encrypted messaging apps or calls, but impractical due to learning curve and detection risks in which case create your own code talker language with an AI. e.g.,\nStratCode System\nAlphabet: Use 10 simple symbols for phonetics (easy to draw/speak): ⊙ (oh) - Open circle for vowels like O/A.\n| (ih) - Line for I/E.\n△ (ah) - Triangle for A/U.\n× (kh) - X for hard consonants K/G.\n~ (sh) - Wave for S/Sh.\n□ (th) - Square for T/D.\n○ (eh) - Empty circle for E.\n/ (fh) - Slash for F/V.\n\\ (rh) - Backslash for R/L. (mh) - Plus for M/N/H. Combine for words (e.g., ⊙| = \"oi\" sound). Vocabulary for Strategies (map to animals/plants for disguise; speak/draw symbols): Attack/Advance: Eagle (△×~) - △ for sky, × for strike, ~ for swift.\nDefend/Hold: Turtle (□\\⊙) - □ for shell, \\ for slow, ⊙ for safe.\nRetreat/Evacuate: Rabbit (/~) - / for jump, \\ for run, ~ for quick.\nScout/Observe: Owl (⊙○+) - ⊙ for eyes, ○ for night, + for wise.\nSupply/Logistics: Bee (~\\□) - ~ for buzz/work, \\ for hive, □ for store.\nCommunicate/Signal: Wolf (×/+ ) - × for howl, / for pack, + for alert.\nProtest/Rally (civil): Flower (△⊙|) - △ for grow, ⊙ for bloom, | for unite.\nHide/Conceal: Fox (~/) - ~ for sly, / for trick, \\ for burrow.\nAlliance/Join: Tree (|+) - | for trunk, \\ for roots, + for branches.\nDisrupt/Block: Storm (×~○) - × for thunder, ~ for wind, ○ for rain.

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by \"Formatter Board\", all the mechanical stuff is in the \"Engine Controller\" power). Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means. >Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone. Sometimes the bug is as low-level as in the USB stack: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/3fe845b9-1328-4b40-8b02-61... >I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right? Not much, unfortunately.

So far I've built: * A current-time API for some hacked-together IoT devices: https://time.bodge.link/ * A script for my wife that checks her commute time and emails her before it's about to get bad. * An email notification to myself if my Matrix server goes down. * A 'randomly choose a thing' page. https://rand.bodge.link/choose?head&tails * A work phone number voicemail, the script converts the webhook into an email to me. * An email notification any time a new version is released for a few semi-public self-hosted services. * Scrapers for a few companies' job listings that notify me whenever a new job is posted matching some filters. * A WebPush server that I eventually want to use for custom notifications to myself. * An SVG hit counter: https://hits.bodge.link/ Since I'm already maintaining it for myself, I figured I might as well open it up for others.

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

          "text": "I'm working on Tech Posts ( https://techposts.eu ), a Hacker News for Europe! Since the last time I posted on HN it's gained a decent amount of traffic and users. I'm particularly happy with the jobs section, which is growing into a high signal-noise source for European tech jobs: https://techposts.eu/jobs The reason I started this website is because so much incredible innovation and growth in Europe flies under the radar. If you ask Americans many will say it's just \"banks and museums\", stagnant, or worse. But the reality is there is a huge spectrum of exciting companies starting and growing here. We have space launch companies, battery companies, AI companies, and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff. It's an exciting time to be a European in tech! reply",

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

Remembering specific words is hard for me, but I can get neighboring words and get in the ballpark, and simple text search or claude code gets me the rest of the way. The screenshot gets uploaded from my phone to Dropbox, then on my desktop at home a script just periodically checks if there's any new screenshots.

Paul Graham thinks so. Maybe even a tech person angle. What have other people experienced?<p>And how do others cope? I don't really know this world. I do know that my old boss once called me a \"flagitating laser beam\". I think he meant distracted. I use a bunch of systems to cope. For a long time lists, and then Asana. Asana ruled my life.

          "text": "Most responses here are about systems and tools — which help, but they're compensations working around the issue rather than at it. The underlying problem is network regulation in the brain. Your Default Mode Network (the self-referential mind-wandering system) is supposed to quiet down when you engage in tasks. In ADHD, that toggle is unreliable — the DMN keeps intruding, which is why you get that \"barrage of micro ideas\" breaking through during focus. A few things that work at the root: Meditation — not as a relaxation tool, but as direct neuroplasticity training. Focused attention practice (noticing when your mind wandered, returning to object) is literally thousands of reps training that DMN/task-positive toggle. Long-term meditators show measurably better DMN suppression during tasks. Sleep — DMN regulation degrades hard with poor sleep. Non-negotiable foundation. The deeper move is changing your relationship to the thoughts themselves. The DMN will always generate ideas. The shift is recognizing them as arisings rather than commands. They still come — they just lose their grip. reply",

It's the first time I hear that \"meds being too easy to use\" is a drawback, coming from a professional, guess I've come addicted to my psychiatric ailments solely due to how easy the medication is to take, I mean, just a pop and a gulp and I'm the happiest person in the world, so much so that I stop trying completely to better myself! Oh, how little I am learning to walk by myself. I would be running by now if I was unmedicated and about, the problem is that my mind is weak and I'm lazy. If only I had traded these woke mind virus pills for a stoicism book, or lifting metal, or 'detoxed', what a silly human I am. But I guess the weak and mentally strong, unlike yourself, can't do much about it but keep taking all this poison and remaining sheep.

It was pretty great. I tended to turn things around extremely quickly when I found them interesting. If he saw something was taking me a while or I wasn’t making progress after a couple days, he’d just give it to someone else. The net result was I got to pick my own projects, found the job much more interesting, and was significantly more productive. On the flip side of this, there were projects other people would struggle with for weeks that he’d give to me and I’d turn it around in a few hours. These days I don’t find anything interesting and I’ve been trying to will myself to work on the same thing for 2 months (and another for 6+ months) and I can’t seem to do it. I really want to get past these things to find something new to do, but it’s been hard. The one project is massive as well. It had me looking at new career options yesterday. reply",

Caffeine is an absolutely terrible and barely working stimulant for that purpose, so we end up drinking a lot to get some effect, or at least trick ourselves. A cup of coffee is 6oz. I drink like 6-8 a day. I do however stick to average roasts, rather than robustas or light \"breakfast\" roasts. My brother has that brain worm (that I used to have) where using a medication is \"bad\" so instead he drinks like 5 giant energy drinks a day. My father drinks a similar amount of coffee as I do per day, and often drinks coffee as a late night relaxation aide. Stimulants can be \"calming\" to some people who have a certain genetic mutation and often have ADHD The first dose of Ritalin I took, I immediately fell asleep and took a 2 hour nap. reply",

I take Concerta and drink Coffee, but I mostly just enjoy the coffee. It's really hard to stay on track sometimes, it's really hard to go too long without working on something inherently interesting to me. I'm constantly late and prefer late nights, I tend to always have a bad sleep cycle. Really basic things that other people seem good at, I struggle. Taxes, finances, anything that requires ambient awareness of systems that have no clear feedback loops. Sometimes penalties  for trivial things accumulate and it costs a lot of money. Goals, unless they're  something like literally climbing a mountain, don't really motivate me. I don't have any financial or life goals at all, they seem artificial and silly. Without stimulants, and a thankfully somewhat lenient company/client atm, I'd be screwed. The positive is that I seem to be much better at making friends than most other people I know, and enjoy a variety of interesting hobbies. I'm also not that fearful or anxious about trying new things. In terms of who I listen to about the topic, it's certainly not any entrepreneur types, it's mostly friends. Though Trevor Noah has a great podcast on the topic last April https://pca.st/episode/19d903d2-bb2b-4213-837e-89a1af706ea0 Additionally, I cope by exclusion. I don't obligate myself to many things or events, and refuse to participate in group chats. I keep almost no notifications on, and people know that if they need my attention, they can just call me, otherwise I won't respond until I get around to it. I only buy gifts when I find inspiration to, and try not to spread myself too thin. I also try to avoid easy things as much as possible. I failed at easy assignments, easy exams in school, why bother going through the rote motions for no other purpose than to be measured on my performance in doing them? reply",

My brain, my soul knows that something due at 5pm can absolutely be turned in the next day at 8am and nothing in the world will change. Yes, although it's helpful in some situations, most modern everyday systems have no intrinsically urgent or important timelines or consequences. The effect is hard to relate to anyone who panics for exams. There's been moments where my brain just knows the test I'm taking has no bearing on my future, and I'll just space out because it provokes no useful stress response. People don't appreciate how much of their ability to be successful at work comes down to innate anxiety about what usually amounts to bullshit. reply",

Recognize that not every idea or desire is useful, and learn to discard the ones that are not and investigate or give more attention to the ones that are. Organization, take notes and organize them. I often have a scratchpad textfile open, that I then organize into sections (e.g. app ideas, ideas for specific code projects, movie ideas, whatever), break these up further into project or topic files.

I have a general to-do file and a tech todo file, and then notes.txt. When my notex.txt grows too long, which I define as having to scroll at all, I start to break it up. When I break it up, I personally use latex files. I know everyone loves markdown, but I'm not a fan of Obsidian (closed source and electron, ugh), so I fell in love with TexStudio. I have keybindings for simple macros to insert sections and subsections that I can quickly name, and these display in the navigation tree very well. TexStudio also allows multiple tex files open at once with a tabbedinterface, and allows saving sessions, so I can open one file to open all my, say, 'ai app ideas' notes. I've found this to work better for myself than any other available app or solution. Eventually, I'd like to release a fork which would mainly be trimming stuff out rather than really adding anything in, but it's far from a priority for me at the moment. reply",

The way I see it, lean into it. ADHD is a double edged sword - you get intrusive thoughts, some of them are bad, but some of them are ideas. You can’t really change your brain, you can take medication and it might help you focus a bit more. But I say lean into it. I’ve had several successful ventures from pure ADHD fuelled idea binges. I don’t really switch off, but I make sure I work in the office every day because being around people helps. But when I’m alone it’s a barrage of thoughts, some days more intense than others.

          "text": "First of all if you have the money get an official diagnosis. While self diagnosis is often right, ADHD symptoms can have overlap with many other things so it is better to be sure. Now want a quick fix? If you can, get medication. It doesn't work for all people with ADHD but for those that it does it will give you the most bang for the buck. Now there is coping strategies. Therapists can help a lot. There is also people offering ADHD coaching. This is great because the coaches tend to have ADHD themselves and understand you. It helped me personally a lot but be warned that everyone can offer coaching so quality may wary. Last part is lifestyle. Sport. It is not optional. Running is amazing and will help you a lot but if you are not fit enough yet, walk. Walk every day for at least 30min. You need to. Also personally for me reading a physical book for at least 30min a day makes a huge, huge difference. Diet is important but what works varies from ADHD person to person. For me cutting out processed sugar was a good step. Also no caffeine. This may also vary but completely cutting it helped me personally a lot. Yes, it helps somewhat with executive function but only in the short term and does more harm than good in the long term. Generally any form form of self medication be it alcohol, weed and so on, cut it out. Again get proper medication if you can. Honestly accepting that you have ADHD or well at least some form of neurodivergency is already the biggest step. It gets so much easier once you learn how to properly manage it. reply",

The meds (Vyvanse) help somewhat, but the real key to improvement for me has been using Todoist. IME the real trick is using it consistently, and for everything. My routines (e.g. morning routine: meds, eat, coffee, brush teeth, brush the dog's teeth, etc etc) are all in Todoist, not because I struggle to focus on getting that stuff done in the morning (well, sometimes, perhaps) but because starting the day with do-easy-thing, mark-it-done, repeat, sets up the rest of the day to be run by Todoist instead of the bit of my brain that goes \"I know we should be getting ready to leave but WHAT IF YOU WROTE AN APP TO DO THIS COOL THING, JUST QUICKLY TRY THAT NOW, YOU CAN LEAVE AFTER\". I had a similar experience with org-mode too. It was great at work where I'm at my desk all day, and made a huge difference, but not having a good mobile experience makes it impractical for day-to-day home use. reply",

Dr. Amen has a book that I found helpful https://www.amazon.com/Healing-ADD-Revised-Breakthrough-Prog... I don't take stimulants beyond caffeine, I meditate most days at least once a day, which I find helpful, as well as not stay up too late. I keep a pad of paper by my bed to capture ideas. Working to music seems to help. If you get a lot of ideas, you should reconcile yourself to only acting on a small fraction of them and worry less about all of the possibilities. I try to take care to keep the commitments that I make, writing them down and tracking them. And here it is important to keep a close track. I may be less impaired than you are, although many people have noticed I seem to get a lot of ideas. I collaborated with a partner on a book once, and at one point, about halfway through, he was frustrated with me and said, \"You are a geyser of ideas. We don't need more ideas, we need to complete what we set out to do.\" reply",

For me, knowing I have the idea recorded somewhere puts my mind at ease. - Feel free to just get rid of accumulated browser tabs, random to-do's or even mental notes. If you always have multiple things open, do a hard reset every now and then. It's difficult to let go at first, but you may realize that if an idea was really worth entertaining, it will come back to you. No great contribution is the result of one single thought, IMO. Note: I lean closer to scattered attention than AD(H)D, because it doesn't affect my normal functioning.

Sunlight Exercise - aids sleep, boosts cognition I believe these to be the main ones. The thing is that it all loops back to impulsivity (your brain constantly churning ideas and following them), which realistically, in my experience, is mostly affected by meds, sleep, exercise (as you do it), and maybe over the long run, via meditation.

I also get a lot worse if I am letting a lot of tasks build up and I bounce around between them. Ultimately what worked for me was developing the ability to not react to something crossing my mind. Like in your example right when the micro idea would cross my mind after going deep, I'd just let that micro thought have a few seconds to pass through my mind, and not react to it. I wouldn't give into the thought \"I need to start doing this micro project!\" or have any kind of reaction. Once the immediate reaction passed I would decide whether it's worth changing my focus. This can also be used in the inverse, if I decide to go deep on something, periodically checking in to see if it's still worth going vs asking for help/input. reply",

If you do have ADHD then I don't think you should expect of yourself to be \"fixed\" to match the \"average\" norm. You will still be thinking about random stuff (\"be creative\"), it just will be a bit less of an issue in doing what is important. What seems to work for me: * meds * writing everything down. This is not ADHD specific advice, I got it from GTD and it decreased anxiety. Just get used to the feeling that you will pull it out when you need it. I keep looking around for better solutions, but I no longer expect to have one that is perfect. Currently peeking back into Obsidian, for how flexible it is, but not abandoning OmniFocus and other tools I use. * I prioritize regular sleep, but I allow myself digging deep in a subject that interests me from time to time * physical work is surprisingly relaxing * AI is becoming very important to me in completing tasks which are complex enough for me to get bored/tired/overwhelmed before reaching the finish line. A micro idea is great if you can tell Claude to implement it and come back to you. Even better when it succeeds :) The shorter time from starting to reward of completing is great for delivering. * schedule some time for learning new stuff, otherwise you will become tired that it's all work and no fun * delegate taking into account where you struggle the most. You might feel bad since you are delegating the most difficult work, but it might actually by trivial to people with brains with no such issues. * not everything needs to be done, prioritize and don't worry about the less important stuff your brain throws at you * it's more about setting time blocks to focus on something than reaching a specific goal. An hour scheduled in the calendar for support emails, for development, for reading... * cheer up, we're entering the best period so far for people having ideas and you will have plenty * [BONUS EDIT] noise-cancelling headphones :) reply",

Lately I have found myself completely unable to remember things without writing them down or completely losing focus on a task and instead going off on \"side quests.\" A close friend familiar with ADHD hinted that I probably have \"late developing ADHD\" and advised that I get evaluated/diagnosed. The thought of that kind of scares me---I'm in my late 20s and tend to think I have functioned my whole life without needing any kind of coping strategy or technique to keep myself on top of my work, but now I am facing the possibility that I might just have to start doing things differently, and I'm not sure where to start.

What percentage of your time is spent on activities that benefit from rapid context-switching and short periods of concentration? (Examples might include watching short-form content, browsing/commenting on online forums, most video games, navigating most cities, and working in certain environments). How much time do you spend on activities that benefit from the opposite? Sustained concentration and attention with minimal interruptions. (Examples might include watching movies, reading novels, some video games, navigating countryside, and working in certain environments). Our bodies and minds adapt to the demands we place on them. If you're sedentary all day you'll lose muscle mass, cardio endurance, etc. Late 20s/early 30s is when I started to notice the costs associated with my lifestyle becoming more apparent.

          "text": "There are some really good suggestions in this thread: sleep, exercise, medication. Therapy also helps some. Externalizing my brain helped massively before I was diagnosed. Pages and pages of notes -- both to write an idea down to move away from it and as a way to make sure I do a task. It's way easier for me to accomplish something if I can obsessively plan it out in advance, and it's way easier to stop rolling an idea around in my head if I jot it down (potentially to be never entertained again.) It's a later step after diagnosis, but my doctor told me I'd be surprised at how effective medication can be. They were 100% right. It's not a cure all and it's not without potential side effects, but it makes me sad that it took me so long to approach my primary doctor about the issues. But as a side note, the medical info I've read makes a pretty firm statement that there is no late developing ADHD. One if the diagnostic criteria is that the symptoms occurred during childhood. Coping and your environment may affect the disorder's effect on your life, but it's with you for your life. _However_, adult diagnosis is very real. Your environment changes so much as you age, and it may or may not make ADHD worse. I'd talk to your primary doctor with an open mind, both for what may be going on and for how to deal with it. reply",

          "text": "There are endless systems, tools, and strategies. Carefully consider your environment. I perform best with very little going on around me. In my physical environment and on my PC. Austere. Minimize things that catch your brain and eye. One or two apps at a time, close everything else. Pick your one more important thing every day and work on that. It needs to be a contract. Usually you have one or two important things to be doing and you can ignore everything else without too much consequence. To remember things you need an ironclad todo system that lets you very quickly capture anything you need to remember. You need to be able to record, triage, filter, prioritize, and execute on anything you need to remember. If any one of those stages is leaky you won't trust it and it won't last. My entire life is structured around managing it. I have to have very strong discipline. House must be spotless. Desk must be spotless. Try to work in the same place at the same time every day. Environmental and contextual stability is huge. Your brain must associate a particular desk, chair, place with doing the most important things. If you allow yourself to goof off or do other things in that place you are losing the fight. Working out fixes a lot for me too. I workout or my mood and motivation falls apart. Move or die. Again, consistency is key. Everything I do around environment is to reduce the need to use executive function. It is finite and fickle for people with ADHD. The more you have to think and convince yourself to do things the less likely you are to do them. You need consistent cues. \"Sit down here, start timer, means work on main thing and nothing else.\" If you can have discipline at all of these external things, the work can just happen and there is a kind of freedom in that. Program outlets. Give yourself set, specific time to explore the sidetracking. Don't tell your brain no. Tell it \"later\". It helps if you know there is time for the extra thoughts. That there is a relief valve. Also, drugs. I use prescribed stimulants. There are some unpleasant negative things, but I can function with them and life is better with them. But it isn't some magical cure. You still have to be organized and willing to work on your tasks or you will just be really focused on things you don't really need to be doing. I could write so much more, but that is some top of mind stuff that I think sits at the top of my hierarchy of being productive. Oh and you may need to have some conversations with future you. How is future you, a week, month, year from now going to feel if you burned a lot of time on side quests? reply",

Are the Classical Computation models i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation</a> applicable? What other new models have been invented?<p>2) Quantum Computers: What is the Physics, Organization and Architecture of these? In classical computers you have semiconductor physics, electronic elements and voltage thresholds mapping to logical 1's and 0's. This is then used to build layers of abstractions. What are their equivalents in a quantum computer?  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing</a> has a lot of info. but not quite structured for understanding.<p>3) Quantum Programming: A lot is mentioned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming</a>  and Amazon lists a bunch of books on this topic but am not quite clear on how everything fits.\nAlso as i understand, quantum computing/programming can be simulated on classical hardware but am not clear on the how.<p>PS: Some detailed examples as to how quantum computers/programming actually help you solve problems which cannot be solved on classical computers would be helpful to bring everything together. Shor's algorithm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm</a>) is often mentioned but perhaps starting with a far simpler example would be more accessible.<p>PPS: In particular; I would love to hear from folks who actually study/research/work in this domain regarding what they actually do, its real-world applicabilities and how to go about learning the subject.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

This was a great introduction to the physics underpinning the computations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP... It's long, and the subject matter is intimidating at times, but watch, re-watch, then go deep by finding papers on subjects like superposition and entanglement, which are the key quantum phenomena that unlock quantum computing. It also helps to understand a bit about how various qubit modalities are physically operated and affected by the control systems (e.g. how does a program turn into qubit rotations, readouts, and other instruction executions). Some are superconducting chips using electromagnetic wave impulses, some are suspending an ion/atom and using lasers to mutate states, or photonic chips moving light through gates - among a handful of other modalities in the industry and academia. IBM's Qiskit platform may still have tooling, simulators, and visualizers that help you write a program and step through the operations on the qubit(s) managed by the program: https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit reply",

If i treat everything below a \"logical qubit\" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits ) as a black-box since from programming pov it does not(?) matter can i think of it using classical computation models? This is analogous to how one does not need to know Semiconductor Physics (which is Quantum Physics), Electronic Component Physics to understand the logical boolean framework built on top of it which is then synthesized into an instruction set to program against. reply",

It's worth noting: the book assumes a fair bit of mathematical background, especially in linear algebra. If you don't have the equivalent of an undergrad CS/math/physics degree (with some linear algebra), it may be better to start with gentler sources. One such gentler source is the free online text I wrote with Andy Matuschak -- https://quantum.country .  I'm sure there are others which are very good, but perhaps that's helpful! Both books focus on foundations of the field, and don't cover recent innovations -- the book with Ike Chuang is 26 years old!  Still, many of the foundations have remained quite stable. reply",

For computers/architecture, think of qubits as noisy analog components and error correction as how digital reliability is built on top. Preskill’s NISQ notes are very clear here. For programming, most work is circuit construction and simulation on classical hardware (Qiskit, Cirq). That’s normal and expected.

          "text": "1) Generally the two models of QC are the digital/circuit model (analogous to digital logic gates, with some caveats, such as reversibility of operations, no-cloning theorem), and analog computation (tuning the parameters of a continuous-time quantum system in your lab such that the system produces useful output) 2) The physics/architecture/organization depends heavily on the type of computer being discussed. In classical computing, one \"type\" of computer has won the arms race. This is not yet the case for quantum computers, there are several different physical processes through which people are trying to generate computation, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, photonics, quantum dots, neutral atoms, etc. 3) There are several ways that you can simulate quantum computation on classical hardware, perhaps the most common would be through something like IBM's Qiskit, where you can keep track of the degrees of freedom of the quantum computer throughout the computation, and apply quantum logic gates in circuits. Another, more complicated method, would be something like tensor network simulations, which are efficient classical simulators of a restricted subset of quantum states. 4) In terms of research, one particularly interesting (although I'm biased by working in the field) application is quantum algorithms for nuclear/high energy physics. Classical methods (Lattice QCD) suffer from extreme computational drawbacks (factorial scaling in the number of quarks, NP-Hard Monte Carlo sign problems), and one potential way around this is using quantum computers to simulate nuclear systems instead of classical computers (\"The best model of a cat is another cat, the best model of a quantum system is another quantum system\") If you're interested in learning more about QC, I would highly recommend looking at Nielsen and Chuang's \"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\", it's essentially the standard primer on the world of quantum computation. reply",

          "text": "For learning the theory behind quantum computing, I usually recommend Watrous's lecture notes [1] - they start out by immediately giving a helpful analogy to ordinary probabilistic computation. The online tutorial [2] is a good followup, especially if you want to understand  Clifford gates / stabilizer states, which are important for quantum error correction. If you have a more theoretical bent, you may enjoy learning about the ZX-calculus [3] - I found this useful for understanding how measurement-based quantum computing is supposed to work.

You want to just hang out, you reach out and propose what you’re doing. You want more purposeful and meaningful time, join a volunteer group you vibe with. Even if it’s meeting for coffee. You have to be the one who reaches out. You have to do it on a regular cadence. If, like me, you don’t have little alarms in your head that go off when you haven’t seen someone in a while, you can use automated reminders. I have observed my spouse (who is not on social media) do this and she maintains friendships for decades this way. Nowadays she has regular zoom check ins, book clubs, and more, even with people who moved to the other coast. You do now have the tools for this. I have adopted it into my own life with good results. Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on. You are struggling against many aspects of the way we in the developed world/nerd world live. We have a wealth of passive entertainment, often we have all consuming jobs or have more time-consuming relationship with our families than our parents ever did. We move to different cities for jobs, and even as suburban sprawl has grown, you’re on average probably further away from people who even live in the same city! You get from place to place in a private box on wheels, or alternatively in a really big box on wheels with a random assortment of people. You don’t see people at church, or market day, or whatever other rituals our ancestors had. On the positive side, you have more tools and leisure than ever before to arrange more voluntary meetings. reply",

Decreased knowledge of how to host a gathering. It's not rocket science, but throwing one the first time can seem daunting. And throwing one well does take skill. E.g. icebreakers, identifying and facilitating the right introductions by highlighting mutual interests, making sure wallflowers have a good time, defusing tensions, food, etc. 3. Decreased American tolerance for and ability to handle awkwardness, and there's always going to be some awkwardness in social interactions. 4. Decreased public/accessible American meeting places. There used to (< 2000) be a plethora of low-cost, broadly-accessible spaces that could serve as training wheels for events (handling food, furnishings, cleaning, etc). They've essentially all been privatized, commercialized, and optimized to turn seats -- think real coffee shops disappearing in favor of Starbucks. reply",

I've always focused on the intent (why do I want to attend?) and a few crux details; everything else tends to work out or is just not that important. It seems to be one of the areas where \"fake it until you make it\" not only works but might be superior to ultra-planning. Once you've got the gist down, try and find one thing that you can go a little overboard on; it makes it very memorable. Examples: I made a big pot of home-made chili once, and another time we did (what looked like) an extravagant nacho bar. It was both better and way cheaper than typical event food. Definitely enlist an accomplice, but be aware you likely need to (appear to) be the mastermind.",

Maybe one day it changes but until then I'm there for them. That said, there are of course times where it's better to just let go.

          "text": "I sometimes wonder about this, I have a friend who does most of the organizing for parties or whatever. My sense is that there are a few different kinds of people, among those are people who, if they didn't organize parties, there wouldn't really be much of a platform for hanging out for them and others like them, while others are completely isolated, don't organize and don't have any other third space, and others yet have many smaller interactions from many other parts of life that don't necessitate a larger meetup necessarily. If you're an \"organizer\" type, my guess is that the people you'd hope reciprocate fall into the latter camp; they're happy to show up and have a good time, but they probably have a bunch of other things to explore that for some reason they haven't felt you'd be into... or a bunch of other possible reasons. Asking them to host a party is asking them to fabricate a social setting from thin air, but maybe they just organically don't find that to be something they need to do. For me, I'll host something for a small group if I get some inspiration, but on a week to week basis I'm often in extremely social third-spaces, supplemented by larger parties (probably bi-weekly). My effort is often best spent meeting people for deliberate, intimate, outdoor sports adventures or coffee hangouts, but the same person I know who tends to organize larger parties doesn't really feel like someone who'd be into these; they can't really hold a conversation 1 on 1 for very long, and they're not super curious or vulnerable or athletic in the way that's necessary to engage in those as much. He's a regimented, scheduled, impatient, person. They often need a sort of fabricated social vehicle (also likes to decorate and host), whereas I get nearly all of my socializing from incidentally being in social space. I think it's fine to be either of course. It's ok that my organizer friend doesn't like heights, and so I won't invite him to climb mountains, he likes hosting parties, so I try to attend as many as I can. Note that I don't mean the non-organizer (me) is just passively socializing, it's just that they have different catalysts built into the things they do that extend into socializing easily. I'm DMing 1 or 2 friends, multiple times a week, to do something we both enjoy or just chat while walking around the city. While parties and hosted things are neat, they're just not very good platforms for depth. Just as well, I do try and be inviting to everyone who'd like to come out and do other things, in general it's important to reciprocate, but I'm not hosting a party just because someone else did. reply",

They're good advise, but can be hard to execute on for most people. If we want to solve this at the society or community level, there needs to be more opportunities for low stakes interaction. Places that people can passively gather around a communal activity. I'm reminded of the ladies dancing together in public squares / parks in China. They're usually a group, but mostly anyone can join in. You can just follow along and interact as much as you'd like. If you want to leave, leave. If you want to stay and chat, stay and chat. Downtown San Mateo for example has the potential for this. It's already a closed off street where people go. But today there aren't group activities there that encourages passive interaction, people are still in silos. Perhaps if there were some games / puzzles, chalk boards, townhall type of table setup, that'll encourage passive interaction. reply",

I'm not trying to solve my loneliness, my own personal goal is to find ways to reach out to people who sit alone all day, and are dying from loneliness, and the only way to reach them is to catch them as they walk on the way to the grocery store, and hold up a sign that they can read. The question in my mind is, what next? So far, I've only been doing surveys[1], but I'm looking for the next step. Piggybacking off your suggestion, I like the idea of holding up a sign advertising a free activity that anyone can join, located in a very public space, with zero committment, so they can both show up and walk away at the drop of a hat. Whether it's an ad hoc organized chess tournament, or D&D game, or \"one word story\" or literally anything. That will have to wait until nicer weather, though, to avoid having to rent a place.

She values that newborn for a few reasons. She sees herself in it. She sees pure innocence in it that needs to be protected and nourished. She sees all the potential good (i.e. value) this little child may one day bring to society. She sees her own personal fulfillment in the act of bringing this to fruition, which brings her joy, even amidst all the sacrifices she may have to make for it. Is any of this selfish or bad? Does it in any way devalue her relationship to the child? Extrapolate this to other relationships. A perfect friendship, where two people meet together regularly to find out about each other's recent activities, and encourage each other in life's difficulties, and foster one another's growth and good. They each care about the other, ask how the other is doing and what they're thinking and feeling, offer each other consolation, comfort, and help in times of distress or difficulty. Each gets this from the other, mutually beneficial. One may offer it exclusively at one time, the other reciprocates later, not out of obligation, but gratitude and personal desire. Is this wrong?

If your lot in life is always to be an outsider. There's also the second type of person one can get caught up with, the narcissist. They think that the world owes them everything and they will take, take, take and never give anything. This one is a typically bit easier to deal with and do a little less damage to your mental health. Though they can sometimes be charismatic, so difficult to spot early if you aren't used to dealing with that type of person. The charismatic ones don't demand anything, especially not right off the bad. They make you feel like it's your choice to do them favors. It's easier to notice if you have exceptionally \"wanty\" people in your life. But can happen regardless. Some relationships are dysfunctional. Some people are toxic. That's not a \"mindset\" problem. It's clear you're not familiar with dysfunctional relationships, which is great, so don't accuse others of having the wrong \"mindset\" when you don't know. reply",

More details about the project can be found in the README at &lt;https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io#readme&gt;.<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081 - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "For the retrieval stage, we have developed a highly efficient, CPU-only-friendly text embedding model: https://huggingface.co/MongoDB/mdbr-leaf-ir It ranks #1 on a bunch of leaderboards for models of its size. It can be used interchangeably with the model it has been distilled from ( https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1... ). You can see an example comparing semantic (i.e., embeddings-based) search vs bm25 vs hybrid here: http://search-sensei.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (warning! It will download ~50MB of data for the model weights and onnx runtime on first load, but should otherwise run smoothly even on a phone) This mini app illustrates the advantage of semantic vs bm25 search. For instance, embedding models \"know\" that j lo refers to jennifer lopez. We have also published the recipe to train this type of models if you were interested in doing so; we show that it can be done on relatively modest hardware and training data is very easy to obtain: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12539 reply",

          "text": "I interacted with the authors of these models quite a bit! These are very interesting models. The tradeoff here is that you get even faster inference, but lose on retrieval accuracy [0]. Specifically, inference will be faster because essentially you are only doing tokenization + a lookup table + an average. So despite the fact that their largest model is 32M params, you can expect inference speeds to be higher than ours, which 23M params but it is transformer-based. I am not sure about typical inference speeds on a CPU for their models, but with ours you can expect to do ~22 docs per second, and ~120 queries per second on a standard 2vCPU server. As far as retrieval accuracy goes, on BEIR we score 53.55, all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (a widely adopted compact text embedding model) scores 42.69, while potion-8M scores 30.43. I can't find their larger models but you can generally get an idea of the power level of different embedding models here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard If you want to run them on a CPU it may make sense to filter for smaller models (e.g., <100M params).\nOn the other side our models achieve higher retrieval scores. [0] \"accuracy\" in layman terms, not in accuracy vs recall terms. The correct word here would be \"effectiveness\". reply",

          "text": "For vector generation I started using Meta-LLama-3-8B in april 2024 with Python and Transformers for each text chunk on an RTX-A6000. Wow that thing was fast but noisy and also burns 500W. So a year ago I switched to an M1 Ultra and only had to replace Transformers with Apple's MLX python library. Approximately the same speed but less heat and noise. The Llama model has 4k dimensions so at fp16 thats 8 kilobyte per chunk, which I store in a BLOB column in SQLite via numpy.save(). Between running on the RTX and M1 there is a very small difference in vector output but not enough for me to change retrieval results, regenerate the vectors or change to another LLM. For retrieval I load all the vectors from the SQlite database into a numpy.array and hand it to FAISS. Faiss-gpu was impressively fast on the RTX6000 and faiss-cpu is slower on the M1 Ultra but still fast enough for my purposes (I'm firing a few queries per day, not per minute). For 5 million chunks memory usage is around 40 GB which both fit into the A6000 and easily fits into the 128GB of the M1 Ultra. It works, I'm happy. reply",

The real lightbulb moment is when you realise the ONLY thing a RAG passes to the LLM is a short string of search results with small chunks of text. This changes it from 'magic' to 'ahh, ok - I need better search results'. With small models you cannot pass a lot of search results ( TOP_K=5 is probably the limit ), otherwise the small models 'forget context'. It is fun trying to get decent results - and it is a rabbithole, next step I am going into is pre-summarising files and folders.

BM25 allows you to efficiently enumerate all code locations in your codebase that need to change and then you can set the cli coders off using this list.

Studies generally show when you do agentic retrieval w/ text search, that's pretty good. Adding vector retrieval and graph rag, so the typical parallel multi-retrieval followed by reranking, gives a bit of speedup and quality lift. That lines up with my local flow experience, where it is only enough that I want that for $$$$ consumer/prosumer tools, and not easy enough for DIY that I want to invest in that locally. For those who struggle with tools like spotlight running when it shouldn't, that kind of thing turns me off on the cost/benefit side. For code, I experiment with unsound tools (semgrep, ...) vs sound flow analyzers, carefully setup for the project. Basically, ai coders love to use grep/sed for global replace refactors and other global needs, but keeps tripped up on sound flow analysis. Similar to lint and type checking, that needs to be setup for a project and taught as a skill. I'm not happy with any of my experiments here yet however :( reply",

What a coding agent needs is to be able to locate portions of source code relevant to what it has been tasked with, and preferably in more context-efficient fashion than just grepping and loading entire source files into context. One way to do this is something like Cursor's vector index of code chunks, and another would be something like TreeSitter (or other identifier-based tools) that knows where identifiers (variables, functions) are defined and used. Language servers (LSP) are not useful for this task since they can't tell the agent \"where is function foo() defined\" (but TreeSitter can), since as someone else noted language servers are based on location (line number) not content (symbols). Language servers are designed to help editors. It's possible that ast-grep might be some some use to a coding agent, but looking for syntax/AST patterns rather than just identifier definitions and usages seems a much more niche facility. reply",

          "text": "We handle ~300k customer interactions per day, so latency and precision really matter. We built an internal RAG-based portal on top of our knowledge base (basically a much better FAQ). On the retrieval side, I built a custom search/indexing layer (Node) specifically for service traceability and discovery. It uses a hybrid approach — embeddings + full-text search + IVF-HNSW — to index and cross-reference our APIs, services, proxies and orchestration repos. The RAG pipelines sit on top of this layer, which gives us reasonable recall and predictable latency. Compliance and observability are still a problem. Every year new vendors show up promising audits, data lineage and observability, but none of them really handle the informational sprawl of ~600 distributed systems. The entropy keeps increasing. Lately I’ve been experimenting with a more semantic/logical KAG approach on top of knowledge graphs to map business rules scattered across those systems. The goal is to answer higher-level questions about how things actually work — Palantir-like outcomes, but with explicit logic instead of magic. Curious if others are moving beyond “pure RAG” toward graph-based or hybrid reasoning setups. reply",

Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds. She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute. I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me. She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :) So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with! Birds :) reply",

Again I think the resources it takes to fly being a limitation are not what it’s referring to. A bird just lives its life in an area and never really assesses if a flight to a far off land is possible, if resources would support their journey, or any of that. They just do what all the other birds are doing or of course what their instincts tell them to. We’ve ignored migration and birds that do travel great distances as not a part of this as it’s not a literal statement about flying! reply",

          "text": "You'd think I'd feel differently having seven parrots, but you may be surprised to find I agree with you. To an extent anyway. I struggle with it. Don't bring a parrot into captivity from the wild. Separating them from the life they already know is cruel -- save for medical exceptions, after which you release them back. But it's already been done, and we have domesticated parrots. They are raised by humans, hand-fed by humans, and they bond with humans. They have slim odds of reintegrating back into the wild, where they fend for their lives against other territorial birds. One swoop from a hawk and they're gone. Gone, your buddies that are an integral part of your every day. They climb on your shoulder and attach themselves to you like velcro. They mimic your laugh and preen your hair. You trim their nails, you give them all kinds of delicious fruits and veggies every day. They throw fruit back at you that they don't want, like little children throwing a tantrum. They have a giant daytime aviary that takes up quite literally half your home, and their own night time cages to sleep and rest in. All they know is you and the human touch. They integrated with you and you're their only flock now. The bond of a parrot is extreme and lifelong. Imagine the devestation when their only flock abandons them. A prior owner of one of my birds left their cage outside an exotic's facility, like a child in a basket outside the fire station. For another, she came from a flock of two. Her prior owner murdered the other -- the remaining one is laying an egg now. For two others, their owner's parrots themselves had fertile eggs. She couldn't bring herself to boil, freeze, or smash the eggs as you're supposed to do with eggs you do not want to hatch. For two others, their prior owner of 25 years passed away. And for one other, she simply needed a new home. They all have a home here now where they will peacefully enjoy the rest of their lives with me. I hope to never let them go hungry, alone, abused -- so I have to outlive them and make sure I am their last owner. But as we wish more for our children, I wish more for them. I wish they could fly to the end of a lake and back and know how it feels to feel the breeze under their wings. I wish they could be adopted by a flock of their own kind. That they could endure the harshness of the wild -- and perhaps even come home after a long, fruitful, eventful day outside. ... But who knows if they even want that. :) reply",

I’m used to “pixels are three little lights combining rgb colors”, which doesn’t work here, so I went on a rabbit hole and let me tell you, analog TVs are extremely impressive tech. Getting an electron beam to hit a glass, making the chemicals on it spark, covering it in a “reading motion” for hundreds of lines, and doing that 60 times a second! And the beam is oriented by just careful usage of magnets. It sounds super sci-fi for an already dead, 130 years old technology. I also learned that my childhood was a lie. Turns out that the logic in consoles of the time was tied to the speed of the beam, which in turn used alternating current’s frequency as a clock. This means that since European current changes 50 times per second rather than 60, our games played in slowmo (about 0.8x). American sonic was so much faster!

Page after page was transmitted after one-another, repeatedly. It was sometimes used for subtitles, with some pages with a transparent background. Better receivers cached pages so you wouldn't have to wait for its next transmission when going to another page... Digital television formats adopted the framing from analogue formats and sends the same data in digital form within the vertical blanking interval. Many channels have stopped offering teletext. One network here in Sweden still uses it to deliver news, and I often prefer that format because the articles are concise and distraction-free. BTW.

What surprised me the most was that shiro (white) miso and aka (red) miso are both the same mix of soybeans, salt, and rice malt but fermented for different periods of time. As the miso ferments for longer, its color becomes darker while its flavor becomes milder and more complex. Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic. After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Most miso you can buy in a grocery store is created through forced fermentation over a few months, so if you ever get a chance to try naturally aged miso I would highly recommend! reply",

          "text": "I was able to find this blog post of a deep-dive into the ALPSTUGA: https://danieldk.eu/Hardware/Smart-Home/IKEA-ALPSTUGA . The part from the post that answers your question is this: The sensing platform used is a Sensirion SEN63C, which uses a STCC4 for CO₂ measurements. Unfortunately, this is not an NDIR sensor. Instead it uses less accurate thermal conductivity sensing. This allows building smaller/cheaper sensors, but it depends on the input of the temperature/humidity sensor, because e.g. humidity influences measurements. Also, the sensor relies on the air mixture being 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 0.93% Ar, 400 ppm CO₂ and will stop giving accurate readings when this composition changes (modulo CO₂). The operating conditions are also more limited than most other CO₂ sensors (10–40 °C, 20–80% RH). From what I could gather and what is also mentioned in the conclusion is that the sensor is fine to get a general feeling of the CO2 trends, but that you're better off getting a better sensor if you care about exact values. reply",

I've noticed a pattern but can't quite connect that pattern to my activity or the surroundings. It starts going up around 4pm, which could be homewards-bound vehicles, but it seems to trend even on weekends when there is lower traffic. Maybe I start breathing differently at these times. I'm quite interested in getting to the bottom of it. Unfortunately I'm west facing so plant use is quite limited. What is the atmospheric ambient CO2 level? Is that variable based on location? I've learnt a few things: - I had my sensor on my work desk which meant the CO2 pooled, and was increased dramatically by my breathing almost directly onto it. Moved the sensor at least 1.5m - I had the sensor quite low down, where CO2 pools (being heavier), so moved the sensor to eye level - CO2 seemed to increase when cooking (same room), so while cooking I open the windows and let the warmth flow out of the building reply",

Instead of consuming other peoples interpretation of stoicism I decided to go as close to the source as feasible for me. I have read Letters from a stoic a number of times before and my copy is filled with highlights, but this time I think I will try to limit myself to one or two letters a day and then really think about them properly. The first one really hit me hard and prompted me to write out my own thoughts ( https://jesperreiche.com/seneca-letter-2/ ) whether I will keep doing that I am a little unsure. It feels on the border of how personal I want to be/share on my blog. P.S.

But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing. With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself. There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those \"perfect\" images. When in fact nothing is keeping me from going out and shooting those \"perfect\" images with the camera I already have. reply",

Cloudflare (or any other AS) has no fine control of where your packets to their anycast IPs will actually go.  A given server's response packets will only go to one of their PoPs.  It's just that which one will depend on server location and network configuration (and could change at any time).  Even if multiple of their PoPs tried to fetch forward from the same server, all but one would be unable to maintain a TCP connection without tunneling shenanigans. Tunneling shenanigans are fine for ACKs, but it's inefficient and therefore pretty unlikely that they are doing this for ingress object traffic. reply",

An individual /32 has a specific datacenter (so basically unicast). In a hypothetical world where BGP could route /32s it wouldn’t be anycast. I wasn’t precise, but what I meant was more akin to a single IP shared by multiple datacenters in different regions (from a BGP perspective), which I don’t think Cloudflare has. This is general parallel of ingress unicast as well, a single IP that can be routed to multiple destinations (even if on the BGP level, the entire aggregate is anycast). It would also not explain the OP, because they are seeing the same source IP, but from many (presumably) different source locations whereas with the Cloudflare scheme each location would have a different source IP. reply",

The reverse DNS on that page though suggests that the range is mainly full of name-servers, which would be strange to get requests from but I have no idea what cloudflare does on its network. As for the multiple datacentre thing - one IP address can be Anycast-ed to multiple actual hosts in different physical locations. For example, if I ping 173.245.58.0, I get a response in 11ms from my location here in Helsinki. At the speed of light this means travelling 3,300KM (0.011s * 3x10^8m/s) which doesn't get me anywhere near the States. So again, nothing exciting about 1 IP address coming from different locations. If you look at your raw logs - you might see some headers from cloudflare with more clues. It's interesting, but as others have mentioned, not worth worrying about. reply",

That is what public websites are for. Anyway, if you really do want to persue this silly thing start by looking up the ASN the IP is in and go from there.

          "text": "I like this question because I come at it from a very different lifestyle. I’m a digital nomad and I have mostly lived out of a backpack and carry on for the past 10 years. My philosophy is that things have to be worth carrying and they should be very easily replaceable if anything gets lost, stolen or breaks. A few of my under $100 favs: Universal GaN travel adapter: \nOne of those square bricks that converts from any AC outlet to any AC outlet and has 3 or 4 USB charging ports built in. I got enough wattage to charge my usb-c laptop as well, so one brick takes care of all my devices. Backup android phone:\nOur phones are so critical that I keep a hot swappable spare phone on me, currently a Moto G 2025. It’s already logged into all my apps and 2FA. I could throw my iPhone into the Seine and keep on trucking. It even has backup NFC credit cards. I keep a cheap travel eSim plan active on it so that if I am somewhere sketchy I can leave my main phone at home. Logitech MX Keys Mini:\nGreat portable keyboard. Backlit, usb c and multi-device. Typing this post out on my phone now. GL-iNet Beryl:\nThe do anything travel VPN router running OpenWRT out of the box. Great for securing and extending sketchy WiFi connections or if you have to work off your phone’s hotspot all day. Decathalon Quecha Escape 500 23L:\nSuch a great personal item size backpack for the price, less than 40 euros. reply",

After the first charge they lasted maybe three weeks, then they rapidly faded, and no longer last more than maybe a day, so I've taken them out. I'm curious to hear if there are high quality versions, maybe something that can run off regular AA or AAA batteries so they can be changed when they inevitably burn out. Speaking of tweezers on AliExpress: I love my $5.99 nail clippers that collect the clippings in a small compartment so they don't fly off everywhere. Super solid stainless steel construction that's considerably nicer than the cheap classic clippers I already had; it it had \"Swiss made\" on it or something I would have believed them. The ones I found are in a store called OURINER, but there are lots of weird brands making the same thing. reply",

Listening to music became a full activity. I do it with my coffee. I cannot overstate how much better it feels. - Wiim Mini. Airplay for 70 year old speakers - Plants. They make the whole space look better and give you a sense of the passage of time. - Good pillows, soft sheets. The best of ikea’s sheets is already a massive upgrade. So soft! - Motion activated leds. It’s nice to reach into the pantry and get light, or use the toilet at night without being blinded. They are magnetic and charge with USB C. - Robot vacuum.

When one side was going quieter, I could unscrew and clean it. The clear plastic cord is yellowing now unfortunately, will try to buy a new one. ~€80, Anbernic RG35XXSP: Handheld games console that runs (mostly) open source linux distros. Reinvigorated my retro gaming on the go when the OG consoles are too inconvenient to carry around and emulating on a phone just feels bad. Having syncthing on-device means I'll never lose my saves again, and putting new games on it is as easy as dragging and dropping on my PC. ~€5, Mini media keyboard from aliexpress (just any, really): It works like garbage, but I never realized how badly I needed a remote with access to all of the MPV shortcuts for when I hook up my laptop to the TV. reply",

          "text": "I am very passionate about this question - so much so that I happened make a blog post about it yesterday! I recommend giving LLMs credentials that are extremely fine-grained, where the credentials can only permit the actions you want to allow and not permit the actions you don't want to allow. Often, it may be hard or impossible to do this with your database settings alone - in that case, you can use proxies to separate the credentials the LLM/agent has from the credentials that are actually made to the DB. The proxy can then enforce what you want to allow or block. SSH is trickier because commands are mixed in with all the other data going on in the bytestream during your session. I previously wrote another blog post about just how tricky enforcing command allowlists can be as well: https://www.joinformal.com/blog/allowlisting-some-bash-comma... . A lot of developer CLI tools were not designed to be run by potentially malicious users who can add arbitrary flags! I also have really appreciated simonw's writing on the topic.

This means a completely isolated copy of your DB with all your data that loads in under a second but zero blast radius risk to your actual system for the agent to operate on. When you're okay with the changes we have a \"quick apply\" to replay those changes onto your real db Website is a little behind since we just launched our db sandboxing feature to existing customers and are making it public next week :) If you want to try it email me -> vikram@tryardent.com reply",

The tricky part is that even \"safe\" commands can be dangerous in combination or with certain arguments. `cat /etc/shadow`, `grep -r password`, or `tail -f` on the wrong log file. What's worked better for me: giving the agent access to a read-only replica for DB queries, and for SSH, using a restricted shell (rbash) with PATH limited to specific binaries. Still not bulletproof, but removes the \"approve every ls command\" friction while keeping the obvious footguns out of reach. The mental model shift that helped: treat it less like \"allow/deny lists\" and more like designing a sandbox where the worst outcome is acceptable. If the agent can only read and the worst case is it reads something sensitive - that's a different risk profile than if it can write or delete. reply",

For SSH, you can either use a specific account created for the AI, and limit it's access to what you want it to do, although that is a bit trickier than DB limits. You can also use something like ForceCommand in SSHD config (or command= in your authorized_keys file) to only grant access to a single command (which could be a wrapper around the commands you want it to be able to access). This does somewhat limit the flexibility of what the AI can deal with. My actual suggestion is to change the model you are using to control your servers. Ideally, you shouldn't be SSHing to servers to do things; you should be controlling your servers via some automation system, and you can just have your AI modify the automation system. You can then verify the changes it is making before committing the changes to your control system. Logs should be collected in a place that can be queried without giving access to the system (Claude is great at creating queries in something like ElasticSearch or OpenSearch). reply",

The breakthrough for us wasn’t trying to enumerate “safe” commands globally, but scoping permissions to the step, not the agent. Instead of giving an agent ongoing SSH access with a command allowlist, each step declared exactly what it needed (read logs, run a specific query) and nothing more. That reduced review fatigue a lot, because most steps became obviously safe by construction. Autonomy worked best when it was short-lived and purpose-specific, not continuous. The line for us ended up being: if the agent can surprise you, it has too much authority. reply",

You should define the parser such that it only uses a subset of sql which you consider to be safe.

Lots of advice in this thread, did we forget that ithe age of AI, anything is possible? Have you taken a look at tools such as Xano? Your agent will only execute whichever tool you give it access to.

If we want it to be 100% safe, you probably don't ever do it with non-deterministic layers alone. - Creating tools and tool calling helps - Claude code specifically asks permissions to run certain commands in certain folders and keeps a list of that.  Chances are that is an actual hard filter locally when the llm recommends a command. This would be creating a deterministic layer to keep the non-deterministic layer honest.  This is mandatory because ai models don't return the same level of smarts and intelligence all the time. - Another step that can help is layering the incoming request and the command sent to the CLI between more layers and checks and no direct links to dilute any prompt injection, etc. reply",

          "text": "States like Iran have signal catchers, where they can get a rough idea where a signal is coming from through triangulation.  The US military has had this for over 20 years now.  Often these coordinates are fed in as targets into weapons systems. If you're going the radio route these come to mind: Meshtastic: 1W, one band, local.  Useful if Iran doesn't know about it.  But easy to jam and probably triangulate. Wifi Halow: 1W, can possibly hop between bands, but probably also really easy to jam and triangulate. WSPR:  Possibly good, transmitters can hide in the noise floor, and can go long distances with 100mW of power, but slow.  Probably triangulable, very easy to jam once located in the spectrum.   Data can be transmitted and received with off the shelf components. Military Radios:  Very good.  Transmitters can frequency hop, making triangulation and jamming difficult.  Also encryption.  You can easily transmit in the same frequency space that Iran would be using to avoid jamming.  But also, mostly unobtanium.  I have heard stories about US military radios showing up at Ham Fests. reply",

Self-contained HTML/JavaScript SPAs can provide navigation and the likes of TiddlyWiki[1] can allow for collaboration. A network of couriers can move as fast as road traffic and distribute stuff pretty widely. Contents can be re-shared locally over ad-hoc or mesh WiFi networks even without Internet access. Encryption and steganography can obscure the contents of drives from casual inspection. You can stuff a lot of extraneous data in Office XML documents that are just zip files and look innocuous when opened. 1. For current events content add descriptions, locations, and timestamps to everything. The recipients need that context. 2. Even unencrypted files can be verified with cryptographic signatures. These can be distributed on separate channels including Bluetooth file transfers. 3. Include offline installers for browsers like Dillo or Firefox. Favor plain text formats where possible. FAT32 has the broadest support in terms of file system for the flash drives. Batch, PowerShell, and bash scripts can also be effective in doing more complex things while not needing local installation or invasive installations on people's computers.

So that it would work better with very high latency sneaker-net flash-drive networks?  Especially for the already asynchronous ones like email?  I could envision a user with a messenger/email-like client who \"sends\" (encrypted) messages that get put on a flash drive.  This is carried around the neighborhood, etc, where others do the same.  Eventually someone takes it to a machine with regular internet access, where the messages get delivered to their intended recipients.  And then replies to these messages (coming hours, days, weeks later) also get put on a flash drive, and maybe hopefully get back to the original receivers.  And if the internet-down situation has been resolved, the recipients will already have their messages, but if not, they'll get them when the flash drive arrives.

          "text": "There is no privacy in amateur radio. That is not a matter of preference, it is a regulatory and physical reality. Amateur radio transmissions are public, unencrypted, and attributable. Callsigns are required, modes and frequencies are well known, and transmissions are trivially direction-findable. In a country like Iran, where RF spectrum is actively monitored and unauthorized communications are treated as a security issue, transmitting on amateur bands is effectively broadcasting your location and intent. Direction finding is routine, fast, and does not require exotic equipment. One transmission can be enough. In the US and most other countries, amateur radio is tightly regulated. Encryption to obscure content is explicitly prohibited. Ignoring this can result in fines, seizure of equipment, and loss of license. Foreign operators encouraging or participating in such use are not insulated from consequences simply because the target country is authoritarian. I did not claim to have a better solution. That's the point. When the threat model includes surveillance, attribution, and enforcement, there may be no safe civilian workaround. Suggesting amateur radio in this context is not “imperfect but helpful”, it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what amateur radio actually is and how it is regulated. Amateur radio can't provide privacy, safety, or reliable information flow under an active crackdown. Pretending otherwise is irresponsible. reply",

          "text": "Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86. Even that \"modern\" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad. Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks). The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.

I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8). The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works , without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important. Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use. reply",

A bit of both, though I'm literally drinking out of a coffee mug with the Lua logo on it that was given to me after playing a big part in making Lua a thing at a prevoius job. That might speak to my love of Lua. > Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity. I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people. I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter. However, I'm not sure that will ever be a top level feature, there'll probably always be some level of Lua glue code holding everything together. reply",

OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans. > _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself) This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation. reply",

          "text": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing. I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space. While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching). Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM. God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-) If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat. reply",

I admit my knowledge of CHERI is superficial and have not spent too much time reading the specs until I can play with off-the-shelf CPUs that support it. Singularity/Midori from MS Research have a lot of good ideas but I feel we don't completely have to compromise forcing a managed environment or language in userspace.

It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of \"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png\" you get something like \"vscode_python_debug_settings.png\". A few things it does: Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters\n    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming\n    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)\n    Handles naming conflicts automatically If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through \"Screenshot 2025-12...\" files later. GitHub: https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer reply",

I use screenshot on my phone to remember stuff, so this way it's super easy to search those text files if I'm trying to find something that I only vaguely remember. Remembering specific words is hard for me, but I can get neighboring words and get in the ballpark, and simple text search or claude code gets me the rest of the way. The screenshot gets uploaded from my phone to Dropbox, then on my desktop at home a script just periodically checks if there's any new screenshots.

This differs a lot from what most SQL databases are optimizing for. My best experience has been ignoring SQL and using (sparse) matrix formats for the genomic data itself, possibly combined with some small metadata tables that can fit easily in existing solutions (often even in memory). Sparse matrix formats like CSC/CSR can store numeric data at ~12 bytes per non-zero entry, so a single one of your servers should handle 10B data points in RAM and another 10x that comfortably on a local SSD. Maybe no need to pay the cost of going distributed?

          "text": "Thanks — both are great systems. ClickHouse and Scuba are extremely good at what they’re designed for: fast OLAP over relatively narrow schemas (dozens to hundreds of columns) with heavy aggregation. The issue I kept running into was extreme width: tens or hundreds of thousands of columns per row, where metadata handling, query planning, and even column enumeration start to dominate. In those cases, I found that pushing width this far forces very different tradeoffs (e.g. giving up joins and transactions, distributing columns instead of rows, and making SELECT projection part of the contract). If you’ve seen ClickHouse or Scuba used successfully at that kind of width, I’d genuinely be interested in the details. reply",

          "text": "I think the emerging best way is to do \"agentic search\" over files. If you think about it, Claude Code is quite good at navigating large codebases and finding the required context for a problem. Further, instead of polluting the context of your main agent, you can run a subagent to do search and retrieve the important bits of information and report back to your main agent. This is what Claude Code does if you use the keyword \"explore\". It starts a subagent with Haiku which reads ten of thousands of tokens in seconds. From my experience the only shortcoming of this approach right now is that it's slow, and sometimes haiku misses some details in what it reads. These will get better very soon (in one or two generations, we will likely see opus 4.5 level intelligence at haiku speeds/price). For now, if not missing a detail is important for your usecase, you can give the output from the first subagent to a second one and ask the second one to find important details the first one missed. I've found this additional step to catch most things the first search missed. You can try this for yourself with Claude Code: ask it to create a plan for your spec, and then pass the plan to a second Claude Code session and ask it to find gaps and missing files from the plan. reply",

You can send whatever you want as history, it's entirely up to you and entirely arbitrary. We only think in conversational turns because that's what we've expected a conversation to 'look like'. But that's just a very deeply ingrained convention. Forget that there is such a thing as 'turns' in a LLM convo for now, imagine that it's all 'one-shot'. So you ask A, it responds A1. But when you and B, and expect B1 - which depends on A and A1 already being in the convo history - consider that you are actually sending that again anyhow. Behind the scenes when you think you're sending just 'B' (next prompt) you're actually sending A + A1 + B aka including the history. A and A1 are usually 'cached' but that's not the simplest way to do it, the caching is an optimization. Without caching the model would just process all of A + A1 + B and B1 in return just the same. And then A + A1 + B + B1 + C and expect C1 in return. It just so happens it will cache the state of the convo at your previous turn, and so it's optimized but the key insight is that you can send whatever context you want at any time. If after you send A + A1 + B + B1 + C and get C1, if you want to then send A + B + C + D and expect D1 ... (basically sending the prompts with no responses) - you can totally do that. It will have to re-process all of that aka no cached state, but it will definitely do it for you. Heck you can send Z + A + X, or A + A1 + X + Y - or whatever you want. So in that sense - what you are really sending (if you're using the simplest form API), is sending 'a bunch of content' and 'expecting a response'. That's it. Everything is actually 'one shot' (prefill => response) and that's it. It feels conversational but structural and operational convention. So the very simple answer to your question is: send whatever context you want. That's it. reply",

So if there was already A + A1 + B + B1 + C + C1 and you asking 'D' ... well, [A->C1] is saved as state. It costs 10ms to prepare. Then, they add 'D' as your question and that will be done 'all tokens at once' in bulk - which is fast. Then - they they generate D1 (the response) they have to do it one token at a time, which is slow. Each token has to be processed separately. Also - even if they had to redo- all of [A->C1] 'from scratch' - its not that slow, because the entire block of tokens can be processed in one pass. 'prefill' (aka A->C1) is fast, which by the way is why it's 10x cheaper. So prefill is 10x faster than generation, and cache is 10x cheaper than prefill as a very general rule of thumb. reply",

Compaction always loses information, so I use an alternative approach that works extremely well, based on this almost silly idea — your original session file itself is the golden source of truth with all details, so why not directly leverage it? So I built the aichat feature in my Claude-code-tools repo with exactly this sort of thought; the  aichat rollover option puts you in a fresh session, with the original session path injected, and you use sub agents to recover any arbitrary detail at any time.  Now I keep auto-compact turned off and don’t compact ever. https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o... It’s a relatively simple idea; no elaborate “memory” artifacts, no discipline or system to follow, work until 95%+ context usage. The tool (with the related plugins) makes it seamless: first type “>resume” in your session (this copies session id to clipboard), then quit and run aichat resume <pasted session id> And this launches a TUI offering a few ways to resume your work, one of which is “rollover”; this puts you in a new session with the original session jsonl path injected. \nAnd in the new session say something like, “There is a chat session log file path shown to you; Use subagents strategically to extract details of the task we were working on at the end of it”, or use the /recover-context slash command. If it doesn’t quite get all of it, prompt it again for specific details. There’s also an aichat search command for rust/tantivy based fast full text search to search across sessions, with a TUI for humans and a CLI/JSON mode for agents/subagents. The latter ( and the corresponding skill and sub agent) can be used to recover arbitrary detailed context about past work. reply",

          "text": "Tool calling + recursion seems to be the answer. Two tools are for manipulating the logical call stack - call/return. The trick is to not permit use of any meaningful tools at the root of recursion, but to always make their descriptions available. For instance, the root can't QueryWidgets or ExecuteShell, but any descendant of it can. These constraints result in token-hungry activity being confined to child scopes that are fully isolated from their parents. The only way to communicate between stack frames is by way of the arguments to call() and return(). Theoretically, recursive dispatch gives us exponential scaling of effective context size as we descend into the call graph. It also helps to isolate bad trips and potentially learn from them. reply",

I ask them \"which files would an AI need to do $TASK effectively?\" Each of the 4 responses will disagree, despite some overlap. I take the union of the 4 responses as the canonical set of files that an implementer would need to see. This reduces the risk of missing key files, while increasing the risk of including marginally important files. An easy trade-off. Then I paste the subset of files into GPT 5.2 Pro, and give it $TASK. You could replace the upstream process with N codex sessions instead of N gemini chat windows. It doesn't matter. This process can be automated with structured json outputs, but I haven't bothered yet. It uses much inference compute. But it's better than missing key inputs and wasting time with hallucinated output. reply",

          "text": "It's fairly surprising to me how naive/early we are still in the techniques that we use here. Anthropic's post on the Claude Agent SDK (formerly Claude Code SDK) talks about how the agent \"gathers context\", and is fairly accurate as to how people do it today. 1. Agentic Search (give the agent tools and let it run its own search trajectory): specifically, the industry seems to have made really strong advances towards giving the agents POSIX filesystems and UNIX utilities (grep/sed/awk/jq/head etc) for navigating data. MCP for data retrieval also falls into this category, since the agent can choose to invoke tools to hit MCP servers for required data. But because coding agents know filesystems really well, it seems like that is outperforming everything else today (\"bash is all you need\"). 2. Semantic Search (essentially chunking + embedding, a la RAG in 2022/2023): I've definitely noticed a growing trend amongst leading AI companies to move away from this. Especially if your data is easily represented as a filesystem, (1) seems to be the winning approach. Interestingly though this approach has a pretty glaring flaw: all the approaches today really only provide the agents with raw unprocessed data. There's a ton of recomputation on raw data! Agents that have sifted through the raw data once (maybe it reads v1, v2 and v_final of a design document or something) will have to do the same thing again in the next session. I have a strong thesis that this will change in 2026 (Knowledge Curation, not search, is the next data problem for AI) https://www.daft.ai/blog/knowledge-curation-not-search-is-th... and we're building towards this future as well. Related ideas here that have anecdotal evidence of providing benefits, but haven't really stuck yet in practice include: agentic memory, processing agent trajectory logs, continuous learning, persistent note-taking etc. reply",

Introspection tools for Cursor IDE — 47 read-only commands to inspect conversations, tool calls, context assembly, and agent reasoning from Cursor's internal SQLite databases. By Don Hopkins, Leela AI — Part of MOOLLM The Problem LLM agents are black boxes. You prompt, they respond, you have no idea what happened inside. Context assembly? Opaque. Tool selection? Hidden. Reasoning? Buried in thinking blocks you can't access. Cursor stores everything in SQLite. This tool opens those databases. The Science \"You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something.\" — Seymour Papert, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (Basic Books, 1980), p. 137 Papert's insight: metacognition requires concrete artifacts. Abstract introspection is empty. You need something to inspect. This connects to three traditions: Constructionism (Papert, 1980) — Learning happens through building inspectable artifacts. The Logo turtle wasn't about drawing; it was about making geometry visible so children could debug their mental models. cursor-mirror makes agent behavior visible so you can debug your mental model of how Cursor works. Society of Mind (Minsky, 1986) — Intelligence emerges from interacting agents. Minsky's \"K-lines\" are activation patterns that recall mental states. cursor-mirror lets you see these patterns: which tools activated, what context was assembled, how the agent reasoned. Schema Mechanism (Drescher, 1991) — Made-Up Minds describes how agents learn causal models through Context → Action → Result schemas. cursor-mirror provides the data for schema refinement: what context was assembled, what action was taken, what result occurred.

MOOLLM Anthropic compatible extended meta skill skill: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills/skill Specifically you can check out ORCHESTRATION.yml and other \"YAML Jazz\" metadata in the directory: ORCHESTRATION.yml: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/cursor-... Currently only supports Cursor running on Mac, but I'd be happy to accept PRs for Linux and Windows support. Look at the cursor-chat-relection.md document to see how I had Cursor analyze its own directories, files, and sqlite databases and JSON schemas. Also looking for help developing mirrors and MOOLMM kernel drivers for other orchestrators like Claud Code, etc. DATA-SCHEMAS.yml: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/cursor-... reply",
