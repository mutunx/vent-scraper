          "text": "Truly sorry you feel this way. For what it’s worth, this was common for people graduating into the 2008 financial crisis, too. It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind. Uninstall those apps (and others) if they’re making you worse. reply",

          "text": "Feser's very good at explaining Thomistic/Aristotelian metaphysics clearly.  His _Aquinas: A Beginner's Guide_ is a good introduction. The point of Thomistic/Aristotelian metaphysics it not that it's useful for building things; it isn't, which is why the early moderns mostly abandoned it.  But physics and the quantitative/mechanistic view of the world that it fosters is an abstraction from reality--an extremely useful and productive one, granted, but still an abstraction.  It leaves things out that Thomistic metaphysics retains; and while Aristotelian science has been left in the dust, his metaphysics still has important things to say. Modern philosophy embraced the mechanistic view of the world with Descartes, leading to a number of philosophical problems (the mind-body problem, the problem of other minds, how to account for qualia and consciousness, and so forth) that are amply accounted for in the older philosophy. reply",

I've only started to dip into various parts, but I can already confirm that it is a good introductory compendium of the basics of philosophy, logic, and argumentation. In the same vein is Daniel Dennett's Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking . A personal favorite is Frances  Yates's The Art of Memory (think: intersection of rhetoric, mnemonic systems, philosophical systems, and the occult during the Renaissance). Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography and Typography for Lawyers . Bryan Garner's The Winning Brief . Umberto Eco's How to Write a Thesis . Adler's How to Read a Book . Pierre Bayard's How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read . I could go on. Book posts are my favorite posts on HN, but they always lighten my wallet and at home I'm surrounded with ever-growing piles of great material. reply",

We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI.

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have more than 300 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby.

My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I most recently worked in a UX-centric engineering role at a gaming company and also have prior experience at an early-stage start-up developing a biotech SaaS. I have a graduate-level education in information science from an R1 university alongside degrees and research experience in the health sciences. To be very transparent, I’ve been unemployed for a while after operations for my previous company moved overseas and it's been tough trying to get back into the industry. I took time off to refine my computer science knowledge and get more confident in my engineering skills. I am really looking to break back into tech in a less design-focused role. Please send me a message if you know of any opportunities! Open to connecting on LinkedIn also. :) Thank you! reply",

          "text": "Hi teleforce, thanks! Your project sounds very interesting as well. That actually reminds me, at one point, a researcher suggested looking into geophone or fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data that oil companies sometimes collect in Alaska, potentially for tracking animal movements or impacts, but I never got the chance to follow up. Connecting seismic activity data (like yours) with potential effects on animal vocalizations or behaviour observed in acoustic recordings would be an interesting research direction! Regarding data access: Our labeled dataset (EDANSA, focused on specific sound events) is public here: https://zenodo.org/records/6824272 . We will be releasing an updated version with more samples soon. We are also actively working on releasing the raw, continuous audio recordings. These will eventually be published via the Arctic Data Center (arcticdata.io). If you'd like, feel free to send me an email (address should be in my profile), and I can ping you when that happens. Separately, we have an open-source model (with updates coming) trained on EDANSA for predicting various animal sounds and human-generated noise. Let me know if you'd ever be interested in discussing whether running that model on other types of non-stationary sound data you might have access to could be useful or yield interesting comparisons. reply",

          "text": "Hi d_burfoot, really appreciate you bringing that up! The idea of pre-training a big foundation model on our raw data using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (kind of like how GPT emerged in NLP) is definitely something we've considered and experimented with using transformer architectures. The main hurdle we've hit is honestly the scale of relevant data needed to train such large models from scratch effectively. While our ~19.5 years dataset duration is massive for ecoacoustics, a significant portion of it is silence or ambient noise. This means the actual volume of distinct events or complex acoustic scenes is much lower compared to the densely packed information in the corpora typically used to train foundational speech or general audio models, making our effective dataset size smaller in that context. We also tried leveraging existing pre-trained SSL models (like Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT for speech), but the domain gap is substantial. As you can imagine, raw ecoacoustic field recordings are characterized by significant non-stationary noise, overlapping sounds, sparse events we care about mixed with lots of quiet/noise, huge diversity, and variations from mics/weather. This messes with the SSL pre-training tasks themselves. Predicting masked audio doesn't work as well when the surrounding context is just noise, and the data augmentations used in contrastive learning can sometimes accidentally remove the unique signatures of the animal calls we're trying to learn. It's definitely an ongoing challenge in the field! People are trying different things, like initializing audio transformers with weights pre-trained on image models (ViT adapted for spectrograms) to give them a head start. Finding the best way forward for large models in these specialized, data-constrained domains is still key. Thanks again for the suggestion, it really hits on a core challenge! reply",

We've actually updated it with more samples since the initial release, and getting the new version out is on my to-do list. Polli.ai looks fantastic! It's genuinely exciting to see more people tackling the ecological monitoring challenge with hardware/software solutions. While I know the startup path in this space can be tough financially, the work is incredibly important for understanding and protecting biodiversity. Keep up the great work! reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

          "text": "While all well and true. Some scale is assumed. There’s plenty of need for basic use invoicing like this. Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else.

There are plenty countries where the vendor will charge the account of the customer, like a 'pull' mechanism. In many countries they'll use (or used) checks/cheques for that, or a different payment account like a credit card. The agreement for this would have been a contract. They may still use invoices for larger transactions, but they aren't always required by law. I remember that in the old days, Google, Stripe, etc wouldn't send invoices, sometimes you'd get a minimal receipt message by email, but that was about it. This was particularly annoying for EU-based companies where there are minimal requirements for invoices and/or receipts. Times have changed though. Most companies, including US-based, will now offer invoices that comply with most international regulations. Except PayPal of course, for some reason they still seem to get away with not offering invoices. You'll have to download your monthly account overview in PDF from their merchant portal, and they just slapped the following text on it: \"This statement may serve as a receipt for accounting and tax related purposes.\". reply",

          "text": ">choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). ~30 years ago I worked at a very small business (3 employees) and they used and liked Quickbooks.  The accountant convinced them to switch to some \"better\" system and for around 3 months they had no idea how much money they had, they just lost all visibility into the system because it didn't work in the way they expected.  \"If things didn't look right, we'd just go through every screen in the system and press Post.\"  At the end of those 3 months they realized they had unexpectedly gotten into $70K in debt -- this was ~35 years ago when a house was around that much.  They had to take a second mortgage on their house.  Eventually, they figured out the accounting system, righted the ship, and paid back the second mortgage over a few years.  Y2K really helped, with that giant bump in sales. reply",

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system.

They might do okay, even pretty well, at combat maps and/or character sheets, but I want is the whole game world in the computer. Maps are just a fraction of what I need as a GM. I need data on economics and population numbers and power structures. And I need computation over all those things. For instance, my game rules include an economic subsystem, which takes in the production of goods and services at hundreds of in-game cities, and computes prices for over a thousand player-purchaseable goods. The \"second app\" that I referred to above allows players to (among many other things) purchase stuff at the market nearest their current location and have those items go straight into their character sheet. If the \"item\" is actually an animal, a hired mercenary, etc. then a different subsystem generates a new NPC with the right statistics and attaches the player to it as owner/liege. I could write an extension for a VTT that talks to my economic system over an API, and throws items up on screen, lets players purchase them, moves them into their character sheet using the right function calls in the VTT's extension library, etc. But every step of the way, I would be fighting to cram this subsystem into the VTT's conception that gameplay begins and ends with maps and char sheets. reply",

The only drawback with the docs is they don't focus on correctness and potential concurrency bugs sufficiently. In the very least the stdlib could mark whether particular functions are goroutine safe or not. If you stay guarded for such things, you should be able to get a lot done with very few mistakes. I have limited experience with Rust, but the ownership model and the borrow checker help with avoiding concurrency bugs as well. And personally for me, Rust slowed down the speed at which I could proceed solving the problem at hand.

          "text": "You're a frontend web developer, so I'm assuming you're going to want to work in the areas of either: 1) application security engineering\n2) application penetration testing\n3) devsecops\n4) vulnerability management It really is a big difference from each person on how they \"break into\" it. You've got great foundational qualifications, and probably just need to layer on extra \"security\" ones, if you don't already have them. If you're looking to start a company / start freelancing -- I've got no clue about that though. If you're just dipping your toes further into the web app security side, OWASP has great labs, resources, etc. They have the WSTG (more for pentesters) and ASVS (more for devs), and of course their cheat sheets as well. PortSwigger has great resources to read through on vulnerabilities and labs that will cover a ton of different vulnerabilities. HackTheBox also offers certification pathways: CBBH and CWEE, CBBH is more beginner/intermediate and involves a blackbox approach, where CWEE is more whitebox (from what it looks like). Just because systems have gaps, doesn't mean the orgs actually want help with those gaps, esp. unsolicited. You could always take a look at bug bounty as well (through HackerOne or BugCrowd), but it can be pretty brutal for a beginner as it can involve a ton of recon or \"going deep\" to reach untouched areas of an app. reply",

It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

The only people who think you can make a living from Open Source (without working for a corporate) has never bothered to try. The number who have done it is a rounding error from zero. It's quite literally the hardest way to make money in software. >> individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere Companies cannot donate. People make donations, not companies. The only way to get a person at a company to send you money is by sending them an invoice for pretty much anything . Since you're giving the code away for free, advertising is pretty much all what you've got left to sell. Repeat after me - Donations are not a business model. It's a hobby model.

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.

But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

Here’s how you can make it work: Bounties & Sponsored Issues – Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Bountysource, and Gitcoin offer paid opportunities to fix issues, build features, or improve security in open-source projects. Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

Nearly every piece of code I write at work is part of one of those public, Apache-licensed code bases. Which means I spend most of my time working on OSS. Are these projects the kind of thing anyone else will ever use? Probably not, so long as the company stays in business. The business case my team made was focused on transparency and long-term viability: our customers can see exactly what we're doing with their data and how our systems work, and if we go under, they have a realistic way to continue using our software. This hasn't ended up being a huge selling point, but customers have definitely mentioned it as one of the things they liked about us. reply",

I continued to contribute to OSS by day tho as I would try upstreaming changes / fixes At PeerDB (now ClickHouse) I'm again in OSS, & continue to contribute to other OSS projects as part of my day job. I'm fortunate to be working in a culture that respects devoting working hours to OSS. That's not really a coincidence when I've been doing OSS on the side for years beforehand This isn't for everyone: I spend hours programming outside work, & I agree it's unfair to expect everyone to devote their off hours to programming.

          "text": "OSS is a side hustle for most people that work it. It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

          "text": "Juust putting this out there: 1. Some people made good money from shareware in the early home computer days. One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

Yes, this is lazy ass, this is dangerous, but it is how people behave. I'd think something as dumb (for the user, but complex to make) as a GraphRAG system that already has a developer's code repo and design docs in the system, and is then able to be given \"candidate libraries\" which the GraphRAG+LLM reasoning agent then evaluates the candidate against the active project for compatibility. That would be one decent application, but the better one is once a \"candidate library\" is accepted, that GraphRAG+LLM agent can just-in-time explain to the developer how a library works and should integrate with their active code base than any documentation. reply",

I built it originally to gather the data to build a model which can predict if an article will get upvoted based on the headline,  later I wanted to use it to prevent my YOShInOn RSS reader and agent from posting duplicates.  I learned that the two things contradict because if you scan everything quickly everything has zero votes and zero comments! It used to use arangodb but the license for that sucks so I just tore it down to use postgres,  I developed an adaptation layer that makes postgres look like arangodb,  at least enough to port my applications.  I added the data structures so it can recrawl posts after two weeks so it can be fresh and have accurate counts.  I am talking with a friend about reranking comments so I am planning on using the bot to suck down comments for some big discussions and rerank them. reply",

It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind. Uninstall those apps (and others) if they’re making you worse. reply",

Expect to continue the grind for many many months. Expect to get rejected not for not meeting the bar, but for not exceeding everyone else who also passed that bar. Expect to very likely settle for a job that doesn’t meet the expectations that college (and the previous 10+ years of history) sold you on. Expect that financially, you will end up years behind the curve and that many life plans (ex: home ownership if that’s one of your goals) will be delayed. Expect that you will meet many people younger than you who will be at your financial level because they graduated post-recovery. If you can accept that you just happen to be born at the wrong time, you will be in a better place mentally than where I was at for a long time. I won’t say it’s easy; it will suck. But it is possible to make it out ok. I luckily had some financial and emotional support from my family to keep me going. I don’t know your situation but hopefully you are able to find support too.

          "text": "> From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. I'm going to challenge this as you didn't give specific data to back it up. I read an article recently that did have data, and it made the argument that first jobs, and first salaries, tend to be remarkably \"sticky\". That is, if you are desperate for a job out of college so take one that causes you to be underemployed and underpaid, that doesn't just stick with you for your first job, but data showed that people were underemployed and underpaid for at least a decade after college. The advice in this article was to hold out as long as possible for a desirable job, which meant a ton of networking, taking internships if possible, and also possibly additional schooling. Apologies for not having the article on hand, but here's another one I found in 30 seconds of googling that makes the same argument, with research: https://www.highereddive.com/news/half-of-graduates-end-up-u... reply",

The stats basically say that \"if you start out underemployed, you stay underemployed for a long time\", but my guess is the causation isn't necessarily as it's implied (or, indeed, as I implied it in my first comment). That is, I think it's likely that a lot of people who start out unemployed are just comparatively less motivated, less aggressive, \"go-with-the-flow\"-type people. These folks do better when the market is good and worse when it's bad. But, as you put it, someone with a lot of drive and the skillset is not necessarily doomed to be held back for years if their first job sucks, as long as they set their sights on getting ahead quickly and don't let their stagnant environment rub off on them. reply",

Either way, at this point in time, I don't feel like I've missed out really. Also, I graduated from a pretty mediocre state school. I'm by no means starving. reply",

          "text": "Yeah fwiw I think the ones that managed to get and stay in the industry are doing ok now. I had in mind someone I knew who graduated in 2008 with a CS degree from a state school and needed work immediately, took a helpdesk job, then took the promotions into mid-management, now is a starbucks district manager making like 95k. Never did get to realize that dream of coding professionally. I believe he finally gave up studying & interviewing for junior dev jobs in 2016. At that point why take a \"stale\" graduate when you can just get an actual 22 year old from the same school, seems to have been everyone's reasoning. I saw a similar thing a bunch when teaching at a code school ca 2018 too. It was a great move if you had savings or support for 6-18 months of job search. The ones that got in are still doing ok. But a lot didn't, they had to keep working at what they did before \"temporarily\" while interviewing and most of them are still doing exactly that. So idk, I'm not sure how you would even get numbers on this. How many people would have excelled in this work if they had graduated at a different time, or with more support, but they didn't and they simply aren't here. reply",

          "text": "It's hard to face this when fresh out of school, but one piece of advice I can offer is to network as much as you can. Talk to folks you know that graduated before you and have a job. Talk to professors who might have industry ties in their history. Talk to folks in the career center. Try to be as visible as you can. Yes, I know that seems trivial considering you don't have job experience, but even building relationships at school can pay off. Those types of connections are CRITICAL in the age of scorched-earth AI centric hiring. I spent 9 months recently jobless after getting laid off, and its damned near impossible to get a job through the usual resume farm (LinkedIn job board and the like). Also, look for jobs local to wherever you are that don't look all that glamorous. RTO is a big thing now, and smaller organizations struggle to hire locally without the brand recognition of the big guys. That might be your in for your first job. And the biggest thing, keep your head up. Keep pushing. You just got a degree from an extremely difficult program, and you can hang your hat on that. The factors affecting the job market are not within your control, and your skills will outlast them. reply",

Projecting that feeling onto others suggests you would really benefit from talking to a professional about this. I don't think you're a failure, I don't know you.

I really only have some decent part time work from a blind linkedIn message. Luck really is opportunity + preparation. And these days, you REALLY gotta get lucky. Keep every channel up to advertise yourself, talk around to everyone in your community, and keep bolstering your portfolio. Grab any sort of job possible if you don't decide to move back. If you're willing t relocae for any role, all the better. Just be keenly aware of CoL, because it may slip under your fingers in these times.

There are lots of places outside of US that are starting to invest into AI infra, and having advanced knowledge gives you an edge. Don't limit yourself to MIT - other universities (even overseas) have funding. A lot of times, especially in US, the graduate projects are basically company funded tasks that they can get done while paying way less than the market price, so plenty of those are floating around. 2. Look outside US for jobs. There are remote opportunities everywhere, and at your young age, its not super hard to move. Even China has some startups that can hire within US. 3. In general, even in recession, there are companies that end up making big as demand shifts to more fundamental things. Most companies need IT support.

          "text": "It's a good question, and I'm happy to provide more detail about the Personal Support-Raising requirement. Almost all of Prayvine's users raise their own financial support in order to do their mission/humanitarian work. Typically, this means that they ask their friends, family and faith community to partner with them by providing financial, emotional, and spiritual support for their work. In order to build a better product for our users, I believe that it's important to deeply understand the challenges that they face, including support raising and having to be accountable to and communicate well with a team of donors and partners. I do not expect the person in this role to raise 100% of their salary. I anticipate about 1 month of focused fundraising per year, and Prayvine would provide whatever amount of compensation is not covered by this fundraising. Because Prayvine is a non-profit organization, donations are tax-deductible and are subject to IRS laws governing donor intent (e.g. donations given to support this role cannot be used for any other purposes). I know that this is an unusual requirement for an engineering role, and that the fundraising hurdle can seem daunting or strange. My hope is that for the right person, the ability to make a significant global, humanitarian, and spiritual impact is compelling and attractive enough to outweigh these challenges. I know that it has been for me. I'm happy to answer other questions about this, or other aspects of the role. Please feel free to contact me directly at jobs@prayvine.org. Cheers, Ian (founder/CEO) reply",

You will be the first engineer outside of the founding team. Here is a bit more about us: We're a seed stage AI startup backed by several top tier VCs. We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI. We use AWS, K8s, React, and Rust but there is no requirement to have prior experience with them specifically. We'll teach you! We are a founding team made up of ex-YC, Amazon, Meta, and Harvard Business School with previous successful exits. We also have a 6+ month customer waitlist! We're hiring our first engineer outside the founders. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, design the right solution, and build from zero to one. You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity. We care about slope, not where you are today. This is an opportunity to work in an insanely fast paced, high ownership environment while solving real problems in healthcare. We're happy to share more details on the role in person/on zoom. Please fill out this form if interested! https://wgwx7h7be0p.typeform.com/to/LV0t8OjI reply",

We build drones (software and hardware) We’re looking for engineers who prioritise real world impact, and use technology as a solution. We prefer personal projects or relevant hobbies, not hard leetcode questions. We’re looking for mission-driven engineers. People who see problems in the world and want to help solve them. You’d be working with me to build low latency, multi-drone, modern mission planning, flight monitoring and control software for drones. Other applications include tools for drone design and manufacturing. For my project, we use React, Tailwind, Node, drizzle-orm, Postgres, SQLite, deck.gl, Python, FastAPI, asyncio, and more.

We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots. Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot's position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on. Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 50 people and we're growing rapidly to meet demand. Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS. Some open roles: - Software Engineer, Controls - Software Engineer, Machine Vision - Assembly/manufacturing technicians and robot operators https://www.monumental.co/jobs P.S. We're always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever's needed!)

Every successful codebase becomes large and complex. Instead of improving the product, devs spend more of their time just understanding the code and doing low-level tasks. The solution is to accelerate humans doing what they're best at--and to automate the rest with AI agents, meaning more creativity and less toil for devs. Sourcegraph is the industrial software development platform, accelerating human devs with contextual AI and automating toil away with AI agents, and it's proven today in the world's most important companies.

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I've been freelancing as well as working with a team (US based digital agency) in past years, so I'm comfortable working individually and in team environment. Most of my career I've been working in Wordpress development (been also workin on NextJS projects past two years). I'm open to similar opportunities but would be even more excited for a change (app development - React/NextJS). I adapt quickly and most importantly work hard. Outside of work I love working out and spending time with my friends :) PS: Past year I've gained a lots of knowledge in web accessibility and have been leading the way in this area for a team that I work with currently. It is something that I constantly improve in and enjoy reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

If you're interested in just consulting, I'd love to have a conversation there too. I work with a designer in creating highly creative and user-centric websites and applications.

          "text": "1. \"OTOH I fear that developing no experience for several years to come is going to leave me stranded\" I believe so too. If you do 4-5 years of \"technical writing involving no coding at all nor a particularly deep knowledge of the technology\", that's IMO bad if you plan on going back to writing software. You have 5 years experience now, in 5 years it will mean that you haven't coded for half your career. If you want to keep on coding for a while, look for a job now. It doesn't mean it's urgent; you just don't want to stop coding for years. 2. It seems like it's your second company, and the first one was a startup where you burned out. I just want to let you know that not every company is toxic or dysfunctional. There are a ton of stable companies that are interesting and allow you to have a healthy work/life balance. It does exist, don't lose hope and keep looking! It seems like there is no rush, so you are in a good position. 3. \"I really like the space sector and would love to stay in it\" My opinion here is that as a software engineer, it's easier to change domain than to compensate for years of non-coding. I.e. I believe it would be better for you to find a nice software engineering position in a different domain for a while and eventually come back to the space sector than to stay in the space sector and stop coding for 5 years. You will learn useful things in another domain, while if you don't code in your domain... you still don't code. Again, not that it is bad to not code, but you seem to be willing to keep coding for a while in your career. Again my opinion: as software engineers, we will regularly have to choose whether we want to go into less technical roles, typically management. It's always possible to go from more technical to less technical, but once you do, it's very hard to come back. If you want to stay on the technical side, you have to do it now (I mean, in the next year, not in 5). reply",

Signal to noise ratio is only going to go down, down, down from here... :( I don't think you'll get useful results from deep research in a case like this, trying to distinguish between all the contemporary advertisers and cut through the spam. Deep research is good at summarizing sources, and it works well if you can tell it what kind of trustworthy sources to focus on. It's not so good at judging the relative merit of each source. And in this case, there are no trustworthy sources... it's all just spam. If you manage to get good results out of it for market research, you should probably just start a business and become a billionaire selling that functionality instead of whatever you were researching :) reply",

It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

The only people who think you can make a living from Open Source (without working for a corporate) has never bothered to try. The number who have done it is a rounding error from zero. It's quite literally the hardest way to make money in software. >> individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere Companies cannot donate. People make donations, not companies. The only way to get a person at a company to send you money is by sending them an invoice for pretty much anything . Since you're giving the code away for free, advertising is pretty much all what you've got left to sell. Repeat after me - Donations are not a business model. It's a hobby model. Hosting can work at small scale. But I can host your product for less than you can. So if you're popular I can just host your software, and siphon off a chunk of your market. reply",

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.  Most of my money has been from grants, one large donation from some rando anonymous person, and a nonprofit.

But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

While it is not a sustainable amount of sponsorship, the joy of seeing people support with a few bucks feels incredible. It's a passion project after all. I used to maintain a private fork of an OSS project as I assumed my company wouldn't want specific features out there (especially since they gave a competitive advantage). I eventually met up with the maintainers of that project with a situation I couldn't figure out and they were so eager to help. After, I went to legal and told them it didn't feel fair to have OSS maintainers help out but keep it private, and to my surprise, they agreed. All I had to do was ask, and not assume.

Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

I continued to contribute to OSS by day tho as I would try upstreaming changes / fixes At PeerDB (now ClickHouse) I'm again in OSS, & continue to contribute to other OSS projects as part of my day job. I'm fortunate to be working in a culture that respects devoting working hours to OSS. That's not really a coincidence when I've been doing OSS on the side for years beforehand This isn't for everyone: I spend hours programming outside work, & I agree it's unfair to expect everyone to devote their off hours to programming.

Are these projects the kind of thing anyone else will ever use? Probably not, so long as the company stays in business.

It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

You've got great foundational qualifications, and probably just need to layer on extra \"security\" ones, if you don't already have them. If you're looking to start a company / start freelancing -- I've got no clue about that though. If you're just dipping your toes further into the web app security side, OWASP has great labs, resources, etc. They have the WSTG (more for pentesters) and ASVS (more for devs), and of course their cheat sheets as well. PortSwigger has great resources to read through on vulnerabilities and labs that will cover a ton of different vulnerabilities. HackTheBox also offers certification pathways: CBBH and CWEE, CBBH is more beginner/intermediate and involves a blackbox approach, where CWEE is more whitebox (from what it looks like). Just because systems have gaps, doesn't mean the orgs actually want help with those gaps, esp. unsolicited. You could always take a look at bug bounty as well (through HackerOne or BugCrowd), but it can be pretty brutal for a beginner as it can involve a ton of recon or \"going deep\" to reach untouched areas of an app. reply",

          "text": "I always recommend Ray Dalio's video on how economics: https://youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8 The tariffs and heck, electing a man like Trump, is a response to the existing situation. 1. Debt is very high and increasing at an unsustainable rate. Rather than default on debts, empires always print more money. 2. Competitiveness has gone down. In times of comfort, work ethic goes down too and a culture emerges where the working class is looked down on. 3. Economic disparity results in political polarity between the left and the right. This leads to revolutions. American revolutions tend to be fairly peaceful, but many are violent. 4. Technological advances allows for a shift in the order. New contenders have the conditions to make good use of them, which allows them to outpace the global leader. 5. Wars increase in a desperate move to hold on to power without having an economic lead. This leads to overextension and further collapse. The tariffs are primarily a response to debt and competitiveness. Trump's election and everyone's distrust for him stems from political polarity. Many of his recent surprising actions are in preparation for a war. The tariffs are an attempted cure to an existing problem. But like many cures, it buys time until the inevitable happens. It's not making the US more competitive. It might not cure the economic disparity. So what you see is three things coming together: 1) admission that the US debt may not be manageable, 2) worrying long term outlook, 3) Trump's lack of diplomacy making people assume the worst reply",

Not saying it's a good move, even though if you are already rich and manage to make more billions by screwing the rest of the world, I think it's individually a good move. Which is why it should be highly illegal. I could imagine someone doing that if they were rich, narcissistic and incompetent: they don't care about the recession because they are rich, they don't know the \"better move\" because they are incompetent, and they believe they are right because they are narcissistic. :-) reply",

Adding context on the image thing- I have old 32 bit apps for some of my hardware cameras / other devices that attach to Android Phones, that will not be backed up with all their settings, and that worries me as even though I've extracted their APKs for preserve, each install requires reaching out to a server for first activation and one day there won't be a response when the companies that made those hardware cameras end support - and I won't be able to do that first activation which is all they need. A Full image theoretically would make this a non-factor- but the built in Backup method for Android doesn't do this. This would be the same if had the Apple variant of these cameras. \nAnd while things like TWRP exist which could attempt it fully- that involves unlocking the bootloader which is what one does not want when there is a chance of a casual forensic search. reply",

Yes, this is lazy ass, this is dangerous, but it is how people behave. I'd think something as dumb (for the user, but complex to make) as a GraphRAG system that already has a developer's code repo and design docs in the system, and is then able to be given \"candidate libraries\" which the GraphRAG+LLM reasoning agent then evaluates the candidate against the active project for compatibility. That would be one decent application, but the better one is once a \"candidate library\" is accepted, that GraphRAG+LLM agent can just-in-time explain to the developer how a library works and should integrate with their active code base than any documentation. reply",

What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

LLMs store embeddings of individual tokens (usually parts of words), so a result of an actual search will be top-k embeddings and the corresponding tokens, similar to the output of a Google search. You could extract the initial matrix of embeddings from some open-weights model and find tokens closest to your query. However, it's not clear why do this. OP got coherent text, so that's not search. It's _similar_, though, because attention in LLMs basically looks for most similar tokens. So to answer the question about the term, the LLM had to create a stream of tokens that's semantically closest to the given description. Well, this is somewhat like a search, but it's not exactly the same. reply",

Your query is shorter so there is less typing, the search engine is always faster, the results are far better because you side step the LLM hallucinating as it regurgitates the results it remembers on the page your would have read if you searched. If you aren't confident of the search times, it can take 1/2 an hour of dicking around with different terms, clicking though a couple of pages of search results for each set of term, until you finally figure out the lingo to use.

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

I don't like LLMs for two reasons: * I can't really get a feel for the veracity of the information without double checking it. A lot of context I get from just reading results from a traditional search engine is lost when I get an answer from a LLM. I find it somewhat uncomfortable to just accept the answer, and if I have to double check it anyways, the LLM's answer is kind of meaningless and I might as well use a traditional search engine. * I'm missing out on learning opertunities that I would usually get otherwise by reading or skimming through a larger document trying to find the answer. I appreciate that I skim through a lot of documentation on a regular basis and can recall things that I just happened to read when looking for a solution for another problem. I would hate it if an LLM would drop random tidbits of information when I was looking for concrete answers, but since its a side effect of my information gathering process, I like it. If I were to use an AI assistant that could help me search and curate the results, instead of trying to answer my question directly. Hopefully in a more sleek way than Perplexity does with its sources feature. reply",

As much as the markets prefer stability, everything is relative, so he still has the power to move the markets just by signaling different things moment to moment.  Of course this is not sustainable over the long run, but the American economy is certainly meta enough at this point that it’s very hard to guarantee the repercussions will land while he is still alive/in-office. I hope in the long term the voting public can come back around to the idea that character and thoughtfulness still have a place in politics, but that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest, intellectuals and experts have lost credibility with the public at large, and therefore trust in leadership is entirely based on superficial vibes and talking points that can resonate in a 5-10 second TikTok-ready take. reply",

          "text": "> that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest It's not necessarily that you're smarter, but you have different preferences and concerns given your circumstances. If you're a low-paid worker you're likely very vulnerable and exposed globalisation. Globalisation is great because it means all the bad jobs low-paid workers used to do can be done even cheaper abroad, but if you're one of those workers you have to watch your opportunities drying up. Not sure it's going to happen now, but there was a hope that with places like India coming online even some of the more expensive digital jobs can now more easily be outsourced would be a huge boom for the IT sector which has historically had to pay very high salaries to employ skilled workers in the West. But again, whether this is good or not really depends on if you're one of the workers in these sectors – if you are you might think that we should protect jobs even if it is bad for GDP. Plus if you're poor already you're not going to care much about an economic crash because you have no real stake in the economy. Even if this is a bad way to look at it because things can always get worse, the immediate impact of the DOW dropping isn't going to bother you if you have no assets. Not all, but many people who voted Trump don't want a stable thoughtful character who will continue with the status-quo with a few minor adjustments. They actually want a mad man who will disrupt everything. Many even want the DOW to tank – we're seeing this sentiment all over places like X right now. I live in the UK, but I saw the same kind of thing with Brexit too. Middle-class people understood immigration and the EU was good because immigration increased GDP and it meant those who went to university could study and work abroad. But these types of arguments are not very convincing for someone who is poor and on welfare (which would be over 50%+ of UK households). Politics needs to be discussed from a different perspective. Arguing something is bad for investors or GDP isn't going to convince people who are poor when the people on the other side of the argument are saying it's going to be good for jobs and the average American. Of course whether that's actually true or not is another conversation, but that's the way arguments need to be framed. reply",

          "text": "Yes. A slowdown in Chinese exports, may mean a slowdown in production, and hence a weakness in imports. At the moment the future is uncertain, and that uncertainty spooks markets. But markets recover once certainly is restored. Right now the uncertainty is mostly around the US consumer. Individually they're the big losers here. The goal of the tarrifs is to drive up consumer prices (to the point where local production is attractive. ) But local production takes time to create, so in the meantime they'll have to buy less. Once local production is in place, that will price output at market levels (meaning it stays expensive. ) The market for, say coffee, will fluctuate and production will rebalance somewhat. Americans will likely drink a bit less. But in the long run it'll just be normal. So yes, the market hates an uncertain future, but certainty arrives pretty quick. reply",

If you've never considered working in supply chains before, everything around you, including the device you're reading this on, has a story of how it got there. From raw materials to the final product in your hands, that story is its supply chain. If you're the kind of engineer who thrives on solving novel challenges, such as building modern data pipelines to construct a supply chain from unstructured communication streams, Ameba offers you the opportunity to build from first principles in a greenfield space. We're a seed startup made up of experienced entrepreneurs (who have previously raised $160m+, built supply chains for 30+ brands) and builders (formerly at Meta, Microsoft, Snap, Apple & Palantir). We have big ambitions and are backed by the best investors in Europe, having raised over $9m since our launch just over a year ago — and we're just getting started.

          "text": "It's a good question, and I'm happy to provide more detail about the Personal Support-Raising requirement. Almost all of Prayvine's users raise their own financial support in order to do their mission/humanitarian work. Typically, this means that they ask their friends, family and faith community to partner with them by providing financial, emotional, and spiritual support for their work. In order to build a better product for our users, I believe that it's important to deeply understand the challenges that they face, including support raising and having to be accountable to and communicate well with a team of donors and partners. I do not expect the person in this role to raise 100% of their salary. I anticipate about 1 month of focused fundraising per year, and Prayvine would provide whatever amount of compensation is not covered by this fundraising. Because Prayvine is a non-profit organization, donations are tax-deductible and are subject to IRS laws governing donor intent (e.g. donations given to support this role cannot be used for any other purposes). I know that this is an unusual requirement for an engineering role, and that the fundraising hurdle can seem daunting or strange. My hope is that for the right person, the ability to make a significant global, humanitarian, and spiritual impact is compelling and attractive enough to outweigh these challenges. I know that it has been for me. I'm happy to answer other questions about this, or other aspects of the role. Please feel free to contact me directly at jobs@prayvine.org.

We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots. Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot's position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on. Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 50 people and we're growing rapidly to meet demand. Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS. Some open roles: - Software Engineer, Controls - Software Engineer, Machine Vision - Assembly/manufacturing technicians and robot operators https://www.monumental.co/jobs P.S. We're always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever's needed!) Drop me an email if this sounds like you. reply",

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end.

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

I've been a DevOps/Platform engineer for ~10 years and was a Mac/iOS app developer before that. My background is broad and strange, I'm less of a t-shaped person than a comb-shaped guy with a bunch of weird deep spikes and more than a few weird gaps. I want to move into machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My plan is to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research and possibly get my PhD in CS or math (somewhere in the area of topology/manifolds if the latter). I recently had a come-to-$DEITY moment and I'm taking a week off work to do a deep-dive on Slurm and as many other topics as I can cram into each day. I'm new in this space and I have a lot to learn, but I'm really ambitious and looking for a place that won't slow me down. reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I started designing and developing websites way back in 1997 on a Sega Saturn Netlink. Without a keyboard in hand, I hand-wrote my table based HTML markup in old notebooks to transcribe into CGI web editors utilizing an on-screen keyboard and controller, and of course, all while collaborating over IRC. Luckily, times have changed and I now own both multiple PC's and keyboards. I have since worked on countless projects from interesting startups in various spaces, to enterprise level applications, goverment funded incentivized data applications, as well as multiple personal and collaborative projects. I also founded Elemeno, a collective of talent functioning as a digital agency. You have most likely even seen some of my design work for large brand-names in the market. - Location: Atlanta, GA USA - Remote: Yes (possibly hybrid) - Willing to Relocate: No - Technologies: React, Vue, Node, Tailwind, NextJS, Typescript, Webpack/Vite, D3, Figma and many more... - Resume/CV: `curl stubbs.sh` to download or: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderstubbs/ - Email: alex [at] alexstubbs.com reply",

I'm a senior software developer/architect looking for interesting roles. I have been doing development for over 15 years, and have a wide range of skills and expertise. I specialize at seeing projects from conception through implementation and release, and have experience leading small development teams and projects as a lead developer, director, architect, and project manager. For the last few years I've mostly been in the Elixir and NodeJS/React spaces, building B2B and B2C projects in both. I'm very much a polyglot though, and have spent time in at least a half-dozen languages over my career. I have a lot of experience in the ministry and non-profit spaces as well. If you're interested in just consulting, I'd love to have a conversation there too. I work with a designer in creating highly creative and user-centric websites and applications. I'd love to have a conversation with you to see if we might be a good fit, either for employment, or for consulting. reply",

It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind.

Expect to continue the grind for many many months. Expect to get rejected not for not meeting the bar, but for not exceeding everyone else who also passed that bar. Expect to very likely settle for a job that doesn’t meet the expectations that college (and the previous 10+ years of history) sold you on. Expect that financially, you will end up years behind the curve and that many life plans (ex: home ownership if that’s one of your goals) will be delayed. Expect that you will meet many people younger than you who will be at your financial level because they graduated post-recovery. If you can accept that you just happen to be born at the wrong time, you will be in a better place mentally than where I was at for a long time. I won’t say it’s easy; it will suck. But it is possible to make it out ok. I luckily had some financial and emotional support from my family to keep me going. I don’t know your situation but hopefully you are able to find support too.

This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. I'm going to challenge this as you didn't give specific data to back it up. I read an article recently that did have data, and it made the argument that first jobs, and first salaries, tend to be remarkably \"sticky\". That is, if you are desperate for a job out of college so take one that causes you to be underemployed and underpaid, that doesn't just stick with you for your first job, but data showed that people were underemployed and underpaid for at least a decade after college. The advice in this article was to hold out as long as possible for a desirable job, which meant a ton of networking, taking internships if possible, and also possibly additional schooling.

That is, I think it's likely that a lot of people who start out unemployed are just comparatively less motivated, less aggressive, \"go-with-the-flow\"-type people. These folks do better when the market is good and worse when it's bad.

Post-graduation, and especially post-college, people don't have these same opportunities. Fwiw, I'd lean very heavily into interning. Take an internship at the best company you can, that's likely to have solid financials and be hiring when you finish the internship. Intern -> hire is a ridiculous cheat code for your first \"in industry\" job. The employer decreases the risk of making a mistake on an unproven new grad.

Never did get to realize that dream of coding professionally. I believe he finally gave up studying & interviewing for junior dev jobs in 2016. At that point why take a \"stale\" graduate when you can just get an actual 22 year old from the same school, seems to have been everyone's reasoning. I saw a similar thing a bunch when teaching at a code school ca 2018 too. It was a great move if you had savings or support for 6-18 months of job search. The ones that got in are still doing ok. But a lot didn't, they had to keep working at what they did before \"temporarily\" while interviewing and most of them are still doing exactly that. So idk, I'm not sure how you would even get numbers on this. How many people would have excelled in this work if they had graduated at a different time, or with more support, but they didn't and they simply aren't here. reply",

Talk to folks you know that graduated before you and have a job. Talk to professors who might have industry ties in their history. Talk to folks in the career center. Try to be as visible as you can. Yes, I know that seems trivial considering you don't have job experience, but even building relationships at school can pay off. Those types of connections are CRITICAL in the age of scorched-earth AI centric hiring. I spent 9 months recently jobless after getting laid off, and its damned near impossible to get a job through the usual resume farm (LinkedIn job board and the like). Also, look for jobs local to wherever you are that don't look all that glamorous. RTO is a big thing now, and smaller organizations struggle to hire locally without the brand recognition of the big guys. That might be your in for your first job. And the biggest thing, keep your head up. Keep pushing. You just got a degree from an extremely difficult program, and you can hang your hat on that. The factors affecting the job market are not within your control, and your skills will outlast them. reply",

Sometimes just asking the right people works, but obviously you have to know who to ask, when to ask it, and how to ask it to make it work.  There are also more passive methods like the HN monthly job threads, but you should do active networking as your primary networking method in this job market. Even if I apply via a job board to positions that I am supremely qualified for, there is a good chance I'll be auto-rejected within a day.  It has happened multiple times to me and I shrug it off at this point. I know networking is hard, especially when you are just starting out, but I just wanted to write a post saying that it does work if you stick to it. (That said, I would also prepare to be unemployed for an extended period.  Even if you are actively interviewing, it can take months to get a job offer.  For my current position, it took 5 months to get an offer and I started 4 months later due to a housing storage where the job was located.) reply",

Let me tell you a secret that helps with mental sanity. All humans are sinful creatures. We indulge in lot of these sins. If you go through this chain of thought you arrive at conclusion, everyone is inferior to one another. The material superiority you yearn for is a momentary fleet in the river of time. Sometimes just reflect on yourself. One perspective of life is your world governs you. If you are happy in your own world, try to let go of it. Just enjoy the moments and don't hold on it. You are the actor and creator of your reality. Your objective reality is making you feel inferior. Define your role, change your actions, and act accordingly. The inability to act according to your role is the probably reason behind your feeling. You probably see yourself through some different lens where your actions and objective reward do not align. All you can do is control your thoughts and actions. So act. reply",

An alternative is either to go through your network (where people you know can vouch that you are real and not just a monkey slinging ChatGPT'd resumes from a boiler room) or in-person (which is immune to a lot of the boiler-room scams and thus you have more chance your application will actually be considered ). reply",

          "text": "GPT-4o already one-shots Leetcode hard with just a screenshot. I know, it's trained on the answers. But it clicked in my head that if you give the LLM a very detailed specification + tests to the level of detail that Leetcode does, you might actually be able to one-shot any code you like. Over the weekend, I made a game. It's heavily dialogue based. I wanted a screen and game content that centers around this gameplay. It's not a classic VN, more customized like Ace Attorney. It's a free game so I need an intro that hooks people in the first 30 seconds. What examples are good for this? Since there's few games like this, I look into movies. I don't want that scene from Inglourious Basterds, that's too fresh. There's a lot of good stuff in classic film, before the 80s that nobody has seen. These movies had to carry themselves on content because they didn't have special effects. And that's where DeepResearch comes in. I'm looking for specific films that fit the tutorial of the game that I'm trying to build. Without going into details, there's 4 mechanics I want to squeeze into the tutorial level. I'm looking for specific scenes that capture these mechanics. One intent is \"How do I get players to not skip dialogue like they would with a VN?\" AI's interpretation of this is \"scripts that encourage impatience\". I didn't even know what question to ask, and it helped to rephrase my intent into the right questions then find examples of those. It wrote a 6000 word essay, plenty of citations, some with clips. I don't have to spend a couple nights watching Psycho or The Night of the Hunter. I can just jump straight to the clips I want. I can skim 24 different movies in the same two nights. reply",

Signal to noise ratio is only going to go down, down, down from here... :( I don't think you'll get useful results from deep research in a case like this, trying to distinguish between all the contemporary advertisers and cut through the spam. Deep research is good at summarizing sources, and it works well if you can tell it what kind of trustworthy sources to focus on. It's not so good at judging the relative merit of each source. And in this case, there are no trustworthy sources... it's all just spam. If you manage to get good results out of it for market research, you should probably just start a business and become a billionaire selling that functionality instead of whatever you were researching :) reply",

          "text": "1. \"OTOH I fear that developing no experience for several years to come is going to leave me stranded\" I believe so too. If you do 4-5 years of \"technical writing involving no coding at all nor a particularly deep knowledge of the technology\", that's IMO bad if you plan on going back to writing software. You have 5 years experience now, in 5 years it will mean that you haven't coded for half your career. If you want to keep on coding for a while, look for a job now. It doesn't mean it's urgent; you just don't want to stop coding for years. 2. It seems like it's your second company, and the first one was a startup where you burned out. I just want to let you know that not every company is toxic or dysfunctional. There are a ton of stable companies that are interesting and allow you to have a healthy work/life balance. It does exist, don't lose hope and keep looking! It seems like there is no rush, so you are in a good position. 3. \"I really like the space sector and would love to stay in it\" My opinion here is that as a software engineer, it's easier to change domain than to compensate for years of non-coding. I.e. I believe it would be better for you to find a nice software engineering position in a different domain for a while and eventually come back to the space sector than to stay in the space sector and stop coding for 5 years. You will learn useful things in another domain, while if you don't code in your domain... you still don't code. Again, not that it is bad to not code, but you seem to be willing to keep coding for a while in your career. Again my opinion: as software engineers, we will regularly have to choose whether we want to go into less technical roles, typically management. It's always possible to go from more technical to less technical, but once you do, it's very hard to come back. If you want to stay on the technical side, you have to do it now (I mean, in the next year, not in 5). reply",

I'm glad the doubts that were described in the post amount to a tangible risk in term of career according to others, too. And yes, totally onboard with what you said with basically not coding for a duration equal to my current career duration - I feel there's so much out there I ought to learn and bash my head against that it's honestly crazy to think the managers would not find something weird with such a proposal. reply",

It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

The only people who think you can make a living from Open Source (without working for a corporate) has never bothered to try. The number who have done it is a rounding error from zero. It's quite literally the hardest way to make money in software. >> individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere Companies cannot donate. People make donations, not companies. The only way to get a person at a company to send you money is by sending them an invoice for pretty much anything . Since you're giving the code away for free, advertising is pretty much all what you've got left to sell. Repeat after me - Donations are not a business model. It's a hobby model.

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.

But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

          "text": "I contribute to OSS very often, mostly sponsored by the company I work for (we're in video streaming, and we're too small to build everything from scratch). Outside of company hours, I work on my personal streaming project [1], and I've had a couple of people find the \"Buy me a coffee\" button and GitHub sponsors page. While it is not a sustainable amount of sponsorship, the joy of seeing people support with a few bucks feels incredible. It's a passion project after all. I used to maintain a private fork of an OSS project as I assumed my company wouldn't want specific features out there (especially since they gave a competitive advantage). I eventually met up with the maintainers of that project with a situation I couldn't figure out and they were so eager to help. After, I went to legal and told them it didn't feel fair to have OSS maintainers help out but keep it private, and to my surprise, they agreed. All I had to do was ask, and not assume.

          "text": "If you’re aiming to be a \"rogue\" OSS contributor—essentially an independent developer thriving off open-source work—you’ll need a mix of strategy, skill, and visibility. Here’s how you can make it work: Bounties & Sponsored Issues – Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Bountysource, and Gitcoin offer paid opportunities to fix issues, build features, or improve security in open-source projects. Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

I continued to contribute to OSS by day tho as I would try upstreaming changes / fixes At PeerDB (now ClickHouse) I'm again in OSS, & continue to contribute to other OSS projects as part of my day job. I'm fortunate to be working in a culture that respects devoting working hours to OSS. That's not really a coincidence when I've been doing OSS on the side for years beforehand This isn't for everyone: I spend hours programming outside work, & I agree it's unfair to expect everyone to devote their off hours to programming.

          "text": "OSS is a side hustle for most people that work it. It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

Rather, I use it as an assistant with which I can have a back and forth \"conversation\" to acquire other perspectives. Despite a lot of effort, I'm just not a highly skilled developer and I don't have any friends / colleagues I can turn to for assistance (I don't know a single software developer or even another person who enjoys video games). While resources like StackOverflow are certainly useful, having answers tailored to my specific situation really accelerates progress. I'm not trying to cure cancer here and much of what would be considered the \"best approach\" for a small game architecture is unique to the developer. As such, AI is an incredible resource to lean on and get information tailored to my unique use case (here is my code...how does {topic} apply to my situation?\") And yes, I find errors from time to time, but that is good.

You could extract the initial matrix of embeddings from some open-weights model and find tokens closest to your query. However, it's not clear why do this. OP got coherent text, so that's not search. It's _similar_, though, because attention in LLMs basically looks for most similar tokens. So to answer the question about the term, the LLM had to create a stream of tokens that's semantically closest to the given description.

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

I can't yet count once AI misunderstood the meaning of my search while Google loves to make assumptions, rewrite my search query, and deliver the results that pay it the best which have the best ads (in my opinion as a lifetime user).

That may be a useful memory aide when learning. - The real website may have diagrams and other things that may not be available in your LLM tool of choice (grok). - The ACT of browsing to a different web page may help some learners better “compartmentalize” their new knowledge. The human brain works in funny ways. - i have 0 concerns of a hallucination when readings docs directly from the author/source. Unless they also jumped on the LLM bandwagon lol.

          "text": "I freakin' hate telephones, and I always have, and the Dowager Countess of Grantham was correct in surmising that they are torture devices of the highest caliber. I always try to prefer virtual meetings with video and all the trimmings, especially screen-share capability. If not, in-person. Telephoning is like a last resort. I've pondered using TTY/TDD even though I have no physical impairments, but most agencies seem hostile to that sort of barrier and most of the time, I find myself needing to pass voice-recognizing gatekeeper AIs first. When I was promoted to \"sysadmin\" in my first job they set me at a desk with a computer and a PBX telephone. (It was an office at a gov't defense contractor...) The computer I could relate to on an intimate level; the telephone scared the living bejesus out of me, and I prayed it never to ring. A disembodied voice in your ear, especially one that interrupts everything you're doing and demanding a real-time conversation across space and time, that's incredibly rude, yet normalized for 100 years. I have PTSD and other disabilities, and I can get completely rattled and downright hostile/aggro when someone calls me and I'm not prepared, I'm not at my desk, no notes in front of me, even if I'm relaxing at home I just can't deal. I may answer the phone while on a bus or train, but I certainly won't sustain a conversation that way. Outgoing calls are sometimes OK but often end in disaster as I become increasingly frustrated. Now it's not uncommon for someone who's standing at my front door to telephone me. What the hell, I'm less than 3 yards away in here, please don't send me across Cyberspace when you're manifesting in meatspace... On a phone call I have no idea what office I've reached, what is a person's job title or role with a company, what their face looks like, when they may be taking a breath or using other physical cues to aid the conversation. So much metadata is lost in phone conversations that they are wholly dehumanized and require a revolution in etiquette, just to keep the peace. Here's your uptalk origin: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb21lsCQ3EM&si=3j3bYd_0rPa... \"Valley Girl, she's a Valley Girl!\" I'm not autistic and I can read expressions and body language, but perhaps autists are the evolutionary result of disembodied telephone conversations taking out the human element from verbal communication. It is simply amazing that even with apps and ubiquitous Internet and website portals that I still require the telephone to get important business done (and I'm always, always ticking \"it's something else/other/Live Agent/Oh god this is an exception to all your rules please send me a human being\"). reply",

          "text": "It's a good question, and I'm happy to provide more detail about the Personal Support-Raising requirement. Almost all of Prayvine's users raise their own financial support in order to do their mission/humanitarian work. Typically, this means that they ask their friends, family and faith community to partner with them by providing financial, emotional, and spiritual support for their work. In order to build a better product for our users, I believe that it's important to deeply understand the challenges that they face, including support raising and having to be accountable to and communicate well with a team of donors and partners. I do not expect the person in this role to raise 100% of their salary. I anticipate about 1 month of focused fundraising per year, and Prayvine would provide whatever amount of compensation is not covered by this fundraising. Because Prayvine is a non-profit organization, donations are tax-deductible and are subject to IRS laws governing donor intent (e.g. donations given to support this role cannot be used for any other purposes). I know that this is an unusual requirement for an engineering role, and that the fundraising hurdle can seem daunting or strange. My hope is that for the right person, the ability to make a significant global, humanitarian, and spiritual impact is compelling and attractive enough to outweigh these challenges. I know that it has been for me. I'm happy to answer other questions about this, or other aspects of the role. Please feel free to contact me directly at jobs@prayvine.org. Cheers, Ian (founder/CEO) reply",

We're a concierge matchmaker but we don't call ourselves that and we don't charge the obscene prices that matchmakers charge. One of our metrics is how little time you spend in the app. We're explicitly opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of 'traditional' dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation. We're monetizing intent! * We're top-tier VC funded, small team of 2 cofounders (Snapchat, Bumble), a CTO from Snap/Clubhouse, and 3 engineers, based in NYC. * Stack is Django, OpenAI, Flutter, Rust * Looking for a Mid-level Engineer who is an all-arounder. Backend more important than front-end code, but if can also work on client code (or want to learn) that would be ideal. * 1-2 days/week in person, in Brooklyn, and the rest remote. We strongly prefer NYC area candidates. See our \"corporate\" site at https://unusual.inc , and our app site at https://joinsitch.com , and feel free to send me a note at chad@unusual.inc reply",

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip\nCommunity engagement platform for soccer fans.\nBuilt a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com\nCompensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations.\nBuilt V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com\nSecurity and compliance training integrated with workplace tools.\nDeveloped a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app\nApp facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet.\nUsed Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end.

          "text": "Location: Los Angeles Remote: Yes\nRelocation: Case-by-case I'm a CTO, expert engineer, and data professional interested in team-building, consulting and architecting data pipelines. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings. If my profile or any of the technologies listed resonate with you, feel free to reach out via email! reply",

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi. You can check my talks in my profile in RubyVideo ( https://www.rubyevents.org/speakers/cristian-planas ). reply",

I've been a DevOps/Platform engineer for ~10 years and was a Mac/iOS app developer before that. My background is broad and strange, I'm less of a t-shaped person than a comb-shaped guy with a bunch of weird deep spikes and more than a few weird gaps. I want to move into machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My plan is to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research and possibly get my PhD in CS or math (somewhere in the area of topology/manifolds if the latter). I recently had a come-to-$DEITY moment and I'm taking a week off work to do a deep-dive on Slurm and as many other topics as I can cram into each day. I'm new in this space and I have a lot to learn, but I'm really ambitious and looking for a place that won't slow me down. reply",

I've been freelancing as well as working with a team (US based digital agency) in past years, so I'm comfortable working individually and in team environment. Most of my career I've been working in Wordpress development (been also workin on NextJS projects past two years). I'm open to similar opportunities but would be even more excited for a change (app development - React/NextJS). I adapt quickly and most importantly work hard. Outside of work I love working out and spending time with my friends :) PS: Past year I've gained a lots of knowledge in web accessibility and have been leading the way in this area for a team that I work with currently.

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I'm a senior software developer/architect looking for interesting roles. I have been doing development for over 15 years, and have a wide range of skills and expertise. I specialize at seeing projects from conception through implementation and release, and have experience leading small development teams and projects as a lead developer, director, architect, and project manager. For the last few years I've mostly been in the Elixir and NodeJS/React spaces, building B2B and B2C projects in both. I'm very much a polyglot though, and have spent time in at least a half-dozen languages over my career. I have a lot of experience in the ministry and non-profit spaces as well. If you're interested in just consulting, I'd love to have a conversation there too. I work with a designer in creating highly creative and user-centric websites and applications. I'd love to have a conversation with you to see if we might be a good fit, either for employment, or for consulting. reply",

It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind. Uninstall those apps (and others) if they’re making you worse. reply",

Expect to continue the grind for many many months. Expect to get rejected not for not meeting the bar, but for not exceeding everyone else who also passed that bar. Expect to very likely settle for a job that doesn’t meet the expectations that college (and the previous 10+ years of history) sold you on. Expect that financially, you will end up years behind the curve and that many life plans (ex: home ownership if that’s one of your goals) will be delayed. Expect that you will meet many people younger than you who will be at your financial level because they graduated post-recovery. If you can accept that you just happen to be born at the wrong time, you will be in a better place mentally than where I was at for a long time. I won’t say it’s easy; it will suck. But it is possible to make it out ok. I luckily had some financial and emotional support from my family to keep me going. I don’t know your situation but hopefully you are able to find support too. I wish you the best of luck. reply",

You can get a 1st in CS and be a rubbish programmer, you can get a chemistry degree and be an amazing one. A lot of CS is utterly irrelevant to programming, and the vast majority of programming skills are not covered by CS degree. Once you're past 2-3 years experience it stops being relevant, before that it's a way to filter CVs by managers who want to pretend their CS degree wasn't a complete waste of time. If they're asking for a CS degree for a senior role it's basically advertising they're a clueless company. reply",

This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. I'm going to challenge this as you didn't give specific data to back it up. I read an article recently that did have data, and it made the argument that first jobs, and first salaries, tend to be remarkably \"sticky\". That is, if you are desperate for a job out of college so take one that causes you to be underemployed and underpaid, that doesn't just stick with you for your first job, but data showed that people were underemployed and underpaid for at least a decade after college. The advice in this article was to hold out as long as possible for a desirable job, which meant a ton of networking, taking internships if possible, and also possibly additional schooling. Apologies for not having the article on hand, but here's another one I found in 30 seconds of googling that makes the same argument, with research: https://www.highereddive.com/news/half-of-graduates-end-up-u... reply",

Post-graduation, and especially post-college, people don't have these same opportunities. Fwiw, I'd lean very heavily into interning. Take an internship at the best company you can, that's likely to have solid financials and be hiring when you finish the internship. Intern -> hire is a ridiculous cheat code for your first \"in industry\" job. The employer decreases the risk of making a mistake on an unproven new grad.

It's a raw deal and it's not fair, but the only thing you can control is yourself.  Try to keep a positive attitude and understand that it won't be this way forever. reply",

I've seen many people suggest just the opposite- pretending to have a mild disability when filling in the form so that they get the boost from companies which use recruiting software that prioritizes diversity and inclusiveness in candidate pool. Federal contractors are explicitly required to \"take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote and retain\" people with disabilities, with a target of at least 7% of their employees be from that group. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/program-areas/employers/fe... reply",

Never did get to realize that dream of coding professionally. I believe he finally gave up studying & interviewing for junior dev jobs in 2016. At that point why take a \"stale\" graduate when you can just get an actual 22 year old from the same school, seems to have been everyone's reasoning. I saw a similar thing a bunch when teaching at a code school ca 2018 too. It was a great move if you had savings or support for 6-18 months of job search. The ones that got in are still doing ok. But a lot didn't, they had to keep working at what they did before \"temporarily\" while interviewing and most of them are still doing exactly that. So idk, I'm not sure how you would even get numbers on this. How many people would have excelled in this work if they had graduated at a different time, or with more support, but they didn't and they simply aren't here. reply",

          "text": "It's hard to face this when fresh out of school, but one piece of advice I can offer is to network as much as you can. Talk to folks you know that graduated before you and have a job. Talk to professors who might have industry ties in their history. Talk to folks in the career center. Try to be as visible as you can. Yes, I know that seems trivial considering you don't have job experience, but even building relationships at school can pay off. Those types of connections are CRITICAL in the age of scorched-earth AI centric hiring. I spent 9 months recently jobless after getting laid off, and its damned near impossible to get a job through the usual resume farm (LinkedIn job board and the like). Also, look for jobs local to wherever you are that don't look all that glamorous. RTO is a big thing now, and smaller organizations struggle to hire locally without the brand recognition of the big guys. That might be your in for your first job. And the biggest thing, keep your head up. Keep pushing. You just got a degree from an extremely difficult program, and you can hang your hat on that. The factors affecting the job market are not within your control, and your skills will outlast them. reply",

Sometimes just asking the right people works, but obviously you have to know who to ask, when to ask it, and how to ask it to make it work.  There are also more passive methods like the HN monthly job threads, but you should do active networking as your primary networking method in this job market. Even if I apply via a job board to positions that I am supremely qualified for, there is a good chance I'll be auto-rejected within a day.  It has happened multiple times to me and I shrug it off at this point. I know networking is hard, especially when you are just starting out, but I just wanted to write a post saying that it does work if you stick to it. (That said, I would also prepare to be unemployed for an extended period.  Even if you are actively interviewing, it can take months to get a job offer.  For my current position, it took 5 months to get an offer and I started 4 months later due to a housing storage where the job was located.) reply",

Projecting that feeling onto others suggests you would really benefit from talking to a professional about this. I don't think you're a failure, I don't know you.

          "text": "Mah bro, such is life. In fact the entirety of humanity is like that. Unfairness is everywhere. There is nothing wrong being under accomplished. Let me tell you a secret that helps with mental sanity. All humans are sinful creatures. We indulge in lot of these sins. If you go through this chain of thought you arrive at conclusion, everyone is inferior to one another. The material superiority you yearn for is a momentary fleet in the river of time. Sometimes just reflect on yourself. One perspective of life is your world governs you. If you are happy in your own world, try to let go of it. Just enjoy the moments and don't hold on it. You are the actor and creator of your reality. Your objective reality is making you feel inferior. Define your role, change your actions, and act accordingly. The inability to act according to your role is the probably reason behind your feeling. You probably see yourself through some different lens where your actions and objective reward do not align. All you can do is control your thoughts and actions. So act. reply",

          "text": "Thinking is moot though.  What’s going on at the moment is about Trumps raw power.  As much as the markets prefer stability, everything is relative, so he still has the power to move the markets just by signaling different things moment to moment.  Of course this is not sustainable over the long run, but the American economy is certainly meta enough at this point that it’s very hard to guarantee the repercussions will land while he is still alive/in-office. I hope in the long term the voting public can come back around to the idea that character and thoughtfulness still have a place in politics, but that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest, intellectuals and experts have lost credibility with the public at large, and therefore trust in leadership is entirely based on superficial vibes and talking points that can resonate in a 5-10 second TikTok-ready take. reply",

          "text": "> that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest It's not necessarily that you're smarter, but you have different preferences and concerns given your circumstances. If you're a low-paid worker you're likely very vulnerable and exposed globalisation. Globalisation is great because it means all the bad jobs low-paid workers used to do can be done even cheaper abroad, but if you're one of those workers you have to watch your opportunities drying up. Not sure it's going to happen now, but there was a hope that with places like India coming online even some of the more expensive digital jobs can now more easily be outsourced would be a huge boom for the IT sector which has historically had to pay very high salaries to employ skilled workers in the West. But again, whether this is good or not really depends on if you're one of the workers in these sectors – if you are you might think that we should protect jobs even if it is bad for GDP. Plus if you're poor already you're not going to care much about an economic crash because you have no real stake in the economy. Even if this is a bad way to look at it because things can always get worse, the immediate impact of the DOW dropping isn't going to bother you if you have no assets. Not all, but many people who voted Trump don't want a stable thoughtful character who will continue with the status-quo with a few minor adjustments. They actually want a mad man who will disrupt everything. Many even want the DOW to tank – we're seeing this sentiment all over places like X right now. I live in the UK, but I saw the same kind of thing with Brexit too. Middle-class people understood immigration and the EU was good because immigration increased GDP and it meant those who went to university could study and work abroad. But these types of arguments are not very convincing for someone who is poor and on welfare (which would be over 50%+ of UK households). Politics needs to be discussed from a different perspective. Arguing something is bad for investors or GDP isn't going to convince people who are poor when the people on the other side of the argument are saying it's going to be good for jobs and the average American. Of course whether that's actually true or not is another conversation, but that's the way arguments need to be framed. reply",

But markets recover once certainly is restored. Right now the uncertainty is mostly around the US consumer. Individually they're the big losers here. The goal of the tarrifs is to drive up consumer prices (to the point where local production is attractive. ) But local production takes time to create, so in the meantime they'll have to buy less. Once local production is in place, that will price output at market levels (meaning it stays expensive. ) The market for, say coffee, will fluctuate and production will rebalance somewhat. Americans will likely drink a bit less. But in the long run it'll just be normal. So yes, the market hates an uncertain future, but certainty arrives pretty quick. reply",

          "text": "GPT-4o already one-shots Leetcode hard with just a screenshot. I know, it's trained on the answers. But it clicked in my head that if you give the LLM a very detailed specification + tests to the level of detail that Leetcode does, you might actually be able to one-shot any code you like. Over the weekend, I made a game. It's heavily dialogue based. I wanted a screen and game content that centers around this gameplay. It's not a classic VN, more customized like Ace Attorney. It's a free game so I need an intro that hooks people in the first 30 seconds. What examples are good for this? Since there's few games like this, I look into movies. I don't want that scene from Inglourious Basterds, that's too fresh. There's a lot of good stuff in classic film, before the 80s that nobody has seen. These movies had to carry themselves on content because they didn't have special effects. And that's where DeepResearch comes in. I'm looking for specific films that fit the tutorial of the game that I'm trying to build. Without going into details, there's 4 mechanics I want to squeeze into the tutorial level. I'm looking for specific scenes that capture these mechanics. One intent is \"How do I get players to not skip dialogue like they would with a VN?\" AI's interpretation of this is \"scripts that encourage impatience\". I didn't even know what question to ask, and it helped to rephrase my intent into the right questions then find examples of those. It wrote a 6000 word essay, plenty of citations, some with clips. I don't have to spend a couple nights watching Psycho or The Night of the Hunter. I can just jump straight to the clips I want. I can skim 24 different movies in the same two nights. reply",

Signal to noise ratio is only going to go down, down, down from here... :( I don't think you'll get useful results from deep research in a case like this, trying to distinguish between all the contemporary advertisers and cut through the spam. Deep research is good at summarizing sources, and it works well if you can tell it what kind of trustworthy sources to focus on. It's not so good at judging the relative merit of each source. And in this case, there are no trustworthy sources... it's all just spam. If you manage to get good results out of it for market research, you should probably just start a business and become a billionaire selling that functionality instead of whatever you were researching :) reply",

I've on many occasions had folks email me asking me why I put some of the things I do up for free on GitHub. All in all I've made around $17 in almost 10 years through donations (GitHub sponsorships). But I don't do it for the money, although I'll admit it would be nice to receive income for doing something you'd happily do for free anyways.

It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

The only people who think you can make a living from Open Source (without working for a corporate) has never bothered to try. The number who have done it is a rounding error from zero. It's quite literally the hardest way to make money in software. >> individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere Companies cannot donate. People make donations, not companies. The only way to get a person at a company to send you money is by sending them an invoice for pretty much anything . Since you're giving the code away for free, advertising is pretty much all what you've got left to sell. Repeat after me - Donations are not a business model. It's a hobby model. Hosting can work at small scale. But I can host your product for less than you can. So if you're popular I can just host your software, and siphon off a chunk of your market. reply",

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.  Most of my money has been from grants, one large donation from some rando anonymous person, and a nonprofit.

But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

Outside of company hours, I work on my personal streaming project [1], and I've had a couple of people find the \"Buy me a coffee\" button and GitHub sponsors page. While it is not a sustainable amount of sponsorship, the joy of seeing people support with a few bucks feels incredible. It's a passion project after all. I used to maintain a private fork of an OSS project as I assumed my company wouldn't want specific features out there (especially since they gave a competitive advantage). I eventually met up with the maintainers of that project with a situation I couldn't figure out and they were so eager to help. After, I went to legal and told them it didn't feel fair to have OSS maintainers help out but keep it private, and to my surprise, they agreed. All I had to do was ask, and not assume.

          "text": "If you’re aiming to be a \"rogue\" OSS contributor—essentially an independent developer thriving off open-source work—you’ll need a mix of strategy, skill, and visibility. Here’s how you can make it work: Bounties & Sponsored Issues – Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Bountysource, and Gitcoin offer paid opportunities to fix issues, build features, or improve security in open-source projects. Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

That's not really a coincidence when I've been doing OSS on the side for years beforehand This isn't for everyone: I spend hours programming outside work, & I agree it's unfair to expect everyone to devote their off hours to programming. But that's how it happened for me reply",

Nearly every piece of code I write at work is part of one of those public, Apache-licensed code bases. Which means I spend most of my time working on OSS. Are these projects the kind of thing anyone else will ever use? Probably not, so long as the company stays in business. The business case my team made was focused on transparency and long-term viability: our customers can see exactly what we're doing with their data and how our systems work, and if we go under, they have a realistic way to continue using our software. This hasn't ended up being a huge selling point, but customers have definitely mentioned it as one of the things they liked about us. reply",

          "text": "OSS is a side hustle for most people that work it. It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

          "text": "Juust putting this out there: 1. Some people made good money from shareware in the early home computer days. One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

It does RAG but Supabase does that better too. Firebase functions are really good for prototyping, but once it starts to cost money, we move it to AWS. It's good for feature flagging, and we moved that to Growthbook. Analytics started on Firebase and were moved to open source so we'd own the data. The only thing they do well is Crashlytics and that's free. If everyone was as bad a customer as us, I would assume they're in trouble. Unfortunately a lot of people have trust issues with Google. We don't want them controlling data and certainly nothing as core as functions, DB, and feature flagging. Then when people don't use these things, Google kills it real fast. reply",

          "text": "That’s a fair point — ecosystems naturally evolve with competing frameworks, and sometimes that diversity helps the best ideas emerge. But in those examples (PHP vs. .NET vs. Django, React vs. Angular), we usually see clear differences in philosophy, performance, developer experience, or use case fit. What I find puzzling in the current wave of AI agent libraries is that many seem to be doing almost exactly the same thing — wrapping LLMs, defining tools, planning steps — just with slightly different APIs or names. It’s hard to see a fundamental divergence in capability or vision, at least so far. So my question is less about why variety exists — and more about whether this current fragmentation is actually productive, or just noise driven by branding and platform lock-in strategies. Would love to be wrong here if others are seeing more substantial innovation beneath the surface. reply",

          "text": "While I do like LLMs for these tasks, unfortunately this one failed you but was a near enough miss that you couldn't see it. What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

To be clear, I'm using it to become a better small game developer and not relying on it to answer anything I would classify as an \"important question\". Moreover, I don't take everything AI tells me to be 100% accurate (and I never copy/paste the response). Rather, I use it as an assistant with which I can have a back and forth \"conversation\" to acquire other perspectives. Despite a lot of effort, I'm just not a highly skilled developer and I don't have any friends / colleagues I can turn to for assistance (I don't know a single software developer or even another person who enjoys video games). While resources like StackOverflow are certainly useful, having answers tailored to my specific situation really accelerates progress. I'm not trying to cure cancer here and much of what would be considered the \"best approach\" for a small game architecture is unique to the developer. As such, AI is an incredible resource to lean on and get information tailored to my unique use case (here is my code...how does {topic} apply to my situation?\") And yes, I find errors from time to time, but that is good.

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

          "text": "It's a good question, and I'm happy to provide more detail about the Personal Support-Raising requirement. Almost all of Prayvine's users raise their own financial support in order to do their mission/humanitarian work. Typically, this means that they ask their friends, family and faith community to partner with them by providing financial, emotional, and spiritual support for their work. In order to build a better product for our users, I believe that it's important to deeply understand the challenges that they face, including support raising and having to be accountable to and communicate well with a team of donors and partners. I do not expect the person in this role to raise 100% of their salary. I anticipate about 1 month of focused fundraising per year, and Prayvine would provide whatever amount of compensation is not covered by this fundraising. Because Prayvine is a non-profit organization, donations are tax-deductible and are subject to IRS laws governing donor intent (e.g. donations given to support this role cannot be used for any other purposes). I know that this is an unusual requirement for an engineering role, and that the fundraising hurdle can seem daunting or strange. My hope is that for the right person, the ability to make a significant global, humanitarian, and spiritual impact is compelling and attractive enough to outweigh these challenges. I know that it has been for me. I'm happy to answer other questions about this, or other aspects of the role. Please feel free to contact me directly at jobs@prayvine.org.

We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI. We use AWS, K8s, React, and Rust but there is no requirement to have prior experience with them specifically. We'll teach you!

You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity.

We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 50 people and we're growing rapidly to meet demand.

If you've never considered working in supply chains before, everything around you, including the device you're reading this on, has a story of how it got there. From raw materials to the final product in your hands, that story is its supply chain. If you're the kind of engineer who thrives on solving novel challenges, such as building modern data pipelines to construct a supply chain from unstructured communication streams, Ameba offers you the opportunity to build from first principles in a greenfield space. We're a seed startup made up of experienced entrepreneurs (who have previously raised $160m+, built supply chains for 30+ brands) and builders (formerly at Meta, Microsoft, Snap, Apple & Palantir). We have big ambitions and are backed by the best investors in Europe, having raised over $9m since our launch just over a year ago — and we're just getting started.

Email: hoglan (dot) jd (at) gmail Hello! I'm JD, a Software Engineer with experience touching many parts of the stack (frontend, backend, databases, data & ETL pipelines, you name it). Most recently, I spent several years at Google working full-stack on applications that supported our customer service teams. I then switched to working on facilitating our internal teams through frameworks, teaching, and helping them in launching applications. Prior to that, I spent a couple years at First Orion - a smaller data company - helping found & build out a data engineering team as one of the first engineers. We were focused on building data pipelines and models to protect our users from malicious phonecalls. If you know the phrase \"Scam Likely\", we were a pioneer :) There is a noticeable gap in my resume where I was dealing with health issues from 2022 - 2024, but am ready to rejoin the industry. I'm passionate about helping others, teaching, and building tools to improve the experience for developers and other end users. reply",

Here are the biggest projects I've worked on + a single feature that demonstrates my impact on product and/or technical chops : Fanfest – fanfest.vip\nCommunity engagement platform for soccer fans.\nBuilt a browser-based live streaming engine that lets streamers broadcast directly from their browsers in both 16:9 and 9:16 at 1080p (and lower resolutions), with simultaneous streaming to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com. Pequity – pequity.com\nCompensation management platform for mid-to-large organizations.\nBuilt V2 for offer approval chains, reducing complexity and fixing HUGE performance issues. For example, in the worst case scenarion in V1 for a single request it would take 2 minutes to finish. In V2 it's 970ms. Haekka – haekka.com\nSecurity and compliance training integrated with workplace tools.\nDeveloped a system for automatically assigning users training based on non-compliant events like exporting sensitive keys they did in AWS/Slack/Gmail. Flox – flox.app\nApp facilitating social connections by helping friend groups meet.\nUsed Postgis to build an algorithm for auto check-in system for event attendance. reply",

I am an open-source enthusiast and a Google Developer Expert in Dart and Flutter. I owe most of my career to the open-source community. I got exposed to this when I open-sourced my first Android PhotoEditor library, which reached around 3.8K stars and is still active. This led me to an opportunity to speak at Droidcon Berlin 2021, sharing my open-source learnings. My biggest contribution so far in the product was to improve code and app quality by introducing testing to the team.\nBefore that, I was the Android tech lead to build an offline-first app to manage package delivery with real-time location tracking, collaborating with a remote team. Apart from this, I've also worked on web and backend technologies like React and Spring Boot, \nwhich gives me additional knowledge of how the system works end-to-end.

At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby. The highlight of my career is probably the decade I have spent at Zendesk, where I am one of the technical leaders of Support, their flagship product, as a Group Tech Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer. My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi. You can check my talks in my profile in RubyVideo ( https://www.rubyevents.org/speakers/cristian-planas ). reply",

I've been a DevOps/Platform engineer for ~10 years and was a Mac/iOS app developer before that. My background is broad and strange, I'm less of a t-shaped person than a comb-shaped guy with a bunch of weird deep spikes and more than a few weird gaps. I want to move into machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My plan is to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research and possibly get my PhD in CS or math (somewhere in the area of topology/manifolds if the latter). I recently had a come-to-$DEITY moment and I'm taking a week off work to do a deep-dive on Slurm and as many other topics as I can cram into each day. I'm new in this space and I have a lot to learn, but I'm really ambitious and looking for a place that won't slow me down. reply",

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

          "text": "I freakin' hate telephones, and I always have, and the Dowager Countess of Grantham was correct in surmising that they are torture devices of the highest caliber. I always try to prefer virtual meetings with video and all the trimmings, especially screen-share capability. If not, in-person. Telephoning is like a last resort. I've pondered using TTY/TDD even though I have no physical impairments, but most agencies seem hostile to that sort of barrier and most of the time, I find myself needing to pass voice-recognizing gatekeeper AIs first. When I was promoted to \"sysadmin\" in my first job they set me at a desk with a computer and a PBX telephone. (It was an office at a gov't defense contractor...) The computer I could relate to on an intimate level; the telephone scared the living bejesus out of me, and I prayed it never to ring. A disembodied voice in your ear, especially one that interrupts everything you're doing and demanding a real-time conversation across space and time, that's incredibly rude, yet normalized for 100 years. I have PTSD and other disabilities, and I can get completely rattled and downright hostile/aggro when someone calls me and I'm not prepared, I'm not at my desk, no notes in front of me, even if I'm relaxing at home I just can't deal. I may answer the phone while on a bus or train, but I certainly won't sustain a conversation that way. Outgoing calls are sometimes OK but often end in disaster as I become increasingly frustrated. Now it's not uncommon for someone who's standing at my front door to telephone me. What the hell, I'm less than 3 yards away in here, please don't send me across Cyberspace when you're manifesting in meatspace... On a phone call I have no idea what office I've reached, what is a person's job title or role with a company, what their face looks like, when they may be taking a breath or using other physical cues to aid the conversation. So much metadata is lost in phone conversations that they are wholly dehumanized and require a revolution in etiquette, just to keep the peace. Here's your uptalk origin: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb21lsCQ3EM&si=3j3bYd_0rPa... \"Valley Girl, she's a Valley Girl!\" I'm not autistic and I can read expressions and body language, but perhaps autists are the evolutionary result of disembodied telephone conversations taking out the human element from verbal communication. It is simply amazing that even with apps and ubiquitous Internet and website portals that I still require the telephone to get important business done (and I'm always, always ticking \"it's something else/other/Live Agent/Oh god this is an exception to all your rules please send me a human being\"). reply",

But the tell tones of a Malaysian accent is it's clipped. Instead of \"I don't like that idea,\" it becomes \"Don't like it.\" ChatGPT may be written American, so as an accent, it would sound closer to, \"I- don't like, that idea.\" And sentences often end in an elongated manner, \"I wrote that is essay you wanted~\".

          "text": "There are almost none because everything goes obsolete in a month. In 6 months, it's deprecated. Nearly every book or guide you find will be outdated by the time it's released and the people who write them are getting exhausted with this loop. I once wrote slides on how to give AI context so it can code. When I asked a friend to proofread it, GPT-4 came out and it was smart enough to make all my techniques obsolete. I updated my workflow for it, and then Cursor came out, basically automating all the indexing and stuff in seconds while I'd take days. There's YouTube, but they tend to be brief and look like hype or unedited. Most of the good stuff is experimental, but experimental isn't helpful and shouldn't be. If you want names: techfren and Sabrina Ramonov The new GPT-4o image update is just amazing. It compounds with the new memory update less 24 hours ago. I could write pages about why but I'd rather just make stuff with it. Anyone who's getting excited about it but not using it is a bit of a hypocrite. Just treat it like a skateboard. No book. You'll fall many times at first. Have fun with it. You don't have to go anywhere, just go around the block. Join one of the many hackathons out there and do something with it. It'll click. Make good use of Cunningham's Law - just exclaim that it can't do Y, and someone will explain how it does Y. Like the skater community, people want to see you do tricks. reply",

It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind.

Expect to continue the grind for many many months. Expect to get rejected not for not meeting the bar, but for not exceeding everyone else who also passed that bar. Expect to very likely settle for a job that doesn’t meet the expectations that college (and the previous 10+ years of history) sold you on. Expect that financially, you will end up years behind the curve and that many life plans (ex: home ownership if that’s one of your goals) will be delayed. Expect that you will meet many people younger than you who will be at your financial level because they graduated post-recovery. If you can accept that you just happen to be born at the wrong time, you will be in a better place mentally than where I was at for a long time. I won’t say it’s easy; it will suck. But it is possible to make it out ok. I luckily had some financial and emotional support from my family to keep me going. I don’t know your situation but hopefully you are able to find support too.

You can get a 1st in CS and be a rubbish programmer, you can get a chemistry degree and be an amazing one. A lot of CS is utterly irrelevant to programming, and the vast majority of programming skills are not covered by CS degree. Once you're past 2-3 years experience it stops being relevant, before that it's a way to filter CVs by managers who want to pretend their CS degree wasn't a complete waste of time. If they're asking for a CS degree for a senior role it's basically advertising they're a clueless company. reply",

This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. I'm going to challenge this as you didn't give specific data to back it up. I read an article recently that did have data, and it made the argument that first jobs, and first salaries, tend to be remarkably \"sticky\". That is, if you are desperate for a job out of college so take one that causes you to be underemployed and underpaid, that doesn't just stick with you for your first job, but data showed that people were underemployed and underpaid for at least a decade after college. The advice in this article was to hold out as long as possible for a desirable job, which meant a ton of networking, taking internships if possible, and also possibly additional schooling. Apologies for not having the article on hand, but here's another one I found in 30 seconds of googling that makes the same argument, with research: https://www.highereddive.com/news/half-of-graduates-end-up-u... reply",

These folks do better when the market is good and worse when it's bad.

Post-graduation, and especially post-college, people don't have these same opportunities. Fwiw, I'd lean very heavily into interning. Take an internship at the best company you can, that's likely to have solid financials and be hiring when you finish the internship. Intern -> hire is a ridiculous cheat code for your first \"in industry\" job. The employer decreases the risk of making a mistake on an unproven new grad.

Never did get to realize that dream of coding professionally. I believe he finally gave up studying & interviewing for junior dev jobs in 2016. At that point why take a \"stale\" graduate when you can just get an actual 22 year old from the same school, seems to have been everyone's reasoning. I saw a similar thing a bunch when teaching at a code school ca 2018 too. It was a great move if you had savings or support for 6-18 months of job search. The ones that got in are still doing ok. But a lot didn't, they had to keep working at what they did before \"temporarily\" while interviewing and most of them are still doing exactly that. So idk, I'm not sure how you would even get numbers on this. How many people would have excelled in this work if they had graduated at a different time, or with more support, but they didn't and they simply aren't here. reply",

          "text": "It's hard to face this when fresh out of school, but one piece of advice I can offer is to network as much as you can. Talk to folks you know that graduated before you and have a job. Talk to professors who might have industry ties in their history. Talk to folks in the career center. Try to be as visible as you can. Yes, I know that seems trivial considering you don't have job experience, but even building relationships at school can pay off. Those types of connections are CRITICAL in the age of scorched-earth AI centric hiring. I spent 9 months recently jobless after getting laid off, and its damned near impossible to get a job through the usual resume farm (LinkedIn job board and the like). Also, look for jobs local to wherever you are that don't look all that glamorous. RTO is a big thing now, and smaller organizations struggle to hire locally without the brand recognition of the big guys. That might be your in for your first job. And the biggest thing, keep your head up. Keep pushing. You just got a degree from an extremely difficult program, and you can hang your hat on that. The factors affecting the job market are not within your control, and your skills will outlast them. reply",

Sometimes just asking the right people works, but obviously you have to know who to ask, when to ask it, and how to ask it to make it work.  There are also more passive methods like the HN monthly job threads, but you should do active networking as your primary networking method in this job market. Even if I apply via a job board to positions that I am supremely qualified for, there is a good chance I'll be auto-rejected within a day.  It has happened multiple times to me and I shrug it off at this point. I know networking is hard, especially when you are just starting out, but I just wanted to write a post saying that it does work if you stick to it. (That said, I would also prepare to be unemployed for an extended period.  Even if you are actively interviewing, it can take months to get a job offer.  For my current position, it took 5 months to get an offer and I started 4 months later due to a housing storage where the job was located.) reply",

Let me tell you a secret that helps with mental sanity. All humans are sinful creatures. We indulge in lot of these sins. If you go through this chain of thought you arrive at conclusion, everyone is inferior to one another. The material superiority you yearn for is a momentary fleet in the river of time. Sometimes just reflect on yourself. One perspective of life is your world governs you. If you are happy in your own world, try to let go of it. Just enjoy the moments and don't hold on it. You are the actor and creator of your reality. Your objective reality is making you feel inferior. Define your role, change your actions, and act accordingly. The inability to act according to your role is the probably reason behind your feeling. You probably see yourself through some different lens where your actions and objective reward do not align. All you can do is control your thoughts and actions. So act. reply",

An alternative is either to go through your network (where people you know can vouch that you are real and not just a monkey slinging ChatGPT'd resumes from a boiler room) or in-person (which is immune to a lot of the boiler-room scams and thus you have more chance your application will actually be considered ). reply",

          "text": "Thinking is moot though.  What’s going on at the moment is about Trumps raw power.  As much as the markets prefer stability, everything is relative, so he still has the power to move the markets just by signaling different things moment to moment.  Of course this is not sustainable over the long run, but the American economy is certainly meta enough at this point that it’s very hard to guarantee the repercussions will land while he is still alive/in-office. I hope in the long term the voting public can come back around to the idea that character and thoughtfulness still have a place in politics, but that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest, intellectuals and experts have lost credibility with the public at large, and therefore trust in leadership is entirely based on superficial vibes and talking points that can resonate in a 5-10 second TikTok-ready take. reply",

          "text": "> that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest It's not necessarily that you're smarter, but you have different preferences and concerns given your circumstances. If you're a low-paid worker you're likely very vulnerable and exposed globalisation. Globalisation is great because it means all the bad jobs low-paid workers used to do can be done even cheaper abroad, but if you're one of those workers you have to watch your opportunities drying up. Not sure it's going to happen now, but there was a hope that with places like India coming online even some of the more expensive digital jobs can now more easily be outsourced would be a huge boom for the IT sector which has historically had to pay very high salaries to employ skilled workers in the West. But again, whether this is good or not really depends on if you're one of the workers in these sectors – if you are you might think that we should protect jobs even if it is bad for GDP. Plus if you're poor already you're not going to care much about an economic crash because you have no real stake in the economy. Even if this is a bad way to look at it because things can always get worse, the immediate impact of the DOW dropping isn't going to bother you if you have no assets. Not all, but many people who voted Trump don't want a stable thoughtful character who will continue with the status-quo with a few minor adjustments. They actually want a mad man who will disrupt everything. Many even want the DOW to tank – we're seeing this sentiment all over places like X right now. I live in the UK, but I saw the same kind of thing with Brexit too. Middle-class people understood immigration and the EU was good because immigration increased GDP and it meant those who went to university could study and work abroad. But these types of arguments are not very convincing for someone who is poor and on welfare (which would be over 50%+ of UK households). Politics needs to be discussed from a different perspective. Arguing something is bad for investors or GDP isn't going to convince people who are poor when the people on the other side of the argument are saying it's going to be good for jobs and the average American. Of course whether that's actually true or not is another conversation, but that's the way arguments need to be framed. reply",

The goal of the tarrifs is to drive up consumer prices (to the point where local production is attractive. ) But local production takes time to create, so in the meantime they'll have to buy less. Once local production is in place, that will price output at market levels (meaning it stays expensive. ) The market for, say coffee, will fluctuate and production will rebalance somewhat. Americans will likely drink a bit less. But in the long run it'll just be normal. So yes, the market hates an uncertain future, but certainty arrives pretty quick. reply",

          "text": "I used to work in VC and have seen a few examples of this. Every case is a little different, but from what you've described I'd focus on salvaging the co-founder relationship. Conflict like this is totally normal. IMO, a pivot is when you change directions based on new information. It sounds like you're not pivoting, but lost. If you haven't already, addressing this head-on and having a candid conversation about being lost would be beneficial. Think of it as an exercise to possibly strengthen your relationship via conflict. Few other thoughts: 1. At this early stage of the business, the core asset is really the co-founding team and their relationship. Conflict is very much normal, but how you resolve it is important. You should be able to articulate your co-founder's concerns. For ex. she might feel the pressure to show \"progress\" to your investors. 2. It takes a lot of time and energy to build a good working relationship. Moving onto something else might seem like a good idea at the moment, but you could be right back with the same issue with another co-founder. 3. If you do decide to move on, end the relationship as amicably as you can. Note that this is not necessarily the \"quickest\" route, but it'll help keep your reputation intact. Edit: spelling. reply",

It's also possible that over the next two years, either he or his coworker could damage their relationships with investors. Typically, messy blow-ups reflect far worse on founders than politely stepping away. It often goes better to simply say something like, \"Hey, I'm sorry, but I don't think we're aligned anymore. This startup probably works best with just one captain at the helm, so for that reason, I'm out.\" Most importantly, even if sticking around for another year or two meant the difference between guaranteed funding and none at all, I'd still choose the extra year or two over the funding. Founders usually earn half—or even a third—of what they would make elsewhere. That extra time essentially translates to a couple of years of self-funded startup runway, and I'd much rather have that flexibility than guaranteed funding with strings attached. reply",

          "text": "Some additional personal observations that OP might find useful: - Building a company is really emotional, as you already know. Most founders are under-skilled when they start, and are forced to learn quickly. As a result, you get a lot of scars along the way and the experience will test all of your insecurities. Learning how to resolve existential crises again and again is part of the package. And it gets worse. Wait until you have whole teams of smart opinionated people that you have to lead. - It'll be good to revisit why you and your co-founder decided to start a company. You've both spent 2 years of your lives living in the trenches, so to speak. Someone decided you two were worth the risk. Why didn't your co-founder quit after the first idea failed? Why does she keep trying? I obviously don't have enough info to make any judgement calls, but I've seen situations where people make the wrong call because they've failed to truly appreciate the emotional baggage. For example, sometimes the first failure hits really hard and triggers all sorts of insecurities in a co-founder about not being good enough. And if their team starts questioning their judgement over and over without diffusing the insecurities, it just makes things worse. - There are good and bad breakups. Good breakups are worth it for the emotional closure and the reputational upside. Bad breakups can create all sorts of fallout that will affect you in unexpected way (sometimes without you even knowing, ex. if the drama resurfaces during due-diligence). All the legal mechanics are also much smoother and drama-free when the breakup is on good terms. - I am probably biased because these types of co-founder blowups are what keep investors up at night. Losing a technical co-founder is not only emotionally draining, but usually lethal for the investment. People problems are gnarly and take a lot of skill and precision to diffuse. If anything, use the crisis as a personal challenge to figure out how to resolve it on good terms. reply",

          "text": "At the risk of an unpopular view, and the inevitable downvotes, I think it's worth stating the following; If your business model is raising money from VCs then doing things VCs want is important to getting paid. All businesses tailor their output to suit their customer. Your customer is VCs. So you need to tailor your output accordingly. In this sense your business partner is not wrong. There's no point on working on things that excite you, if it doesn't excite them. That's a hobby. Sure, pivoting too often is also wrong. So you should try to improve that. At this point it's probably worth sitting down with your partner with the fundamental understanding she is right; You need to find something to attract the next investor. However you need to stick with it, success or fail. You've thrown a lot against the wall, now it's time to choose. Of course you'll likely fail. Most businesses do. VC based businesses at an even higher rate because your customer base is so small. But even failure is OK because VCs are looking for founders, not successes. Make no mistake; founding a startup is hard work. Not fun stuff. Not interesting stuff. Mostly it's just work. Being a founder isn't about coding. It's about business. You need to bring more to the table than just coding. Just like your co-founder takes an interest in the technical side, so you need to take more than a passing interest in the business side. In any business, sales is the most important thing. Without them you will fail. Tech supports sales, not the other way around. I'm sorry that this sounds harsh. I don't mean it that way. I wish you success. That success starts with you realizing the truth at the heart of your partners position. Start there. Fix your relationship. Good luck! reply",

I’ve seen this archetype before—a business person with just enough technical knowledge to chime in on complex product decisions, but without the patience or interest to develop any real depth. Instead of building real understanding, they rely on mimicking what looks successful. Always chasing whatever has funding or buzz. That kind of thinking lacks vision and makes it really hard to build anything meaningful. Over time, it wears you down. Even if the product “works,” it doesn’t feel good because you know you're forcing it. These folks tend to say things like “this should be easy,” then only show up to question why something isn’t done. They manufacture urgency instead of clarity, and when things inevitably fall short, the blame falls on the technical team. Second, you’re not a first-time founder anymore. Life’s short. For me at least, you’ve earned the right to walk away and build something you actually care about again. reply",

          "text": "I have been a similar situation before. Yes, walk away — and learn what you can. There's one easy part of your situation, which is that your immediate next step is clear. I think it's clear because it sounds like the two of you have a fundamental disagreement about how to choose a direction. There's also a power imbalance if you've consistently been going along with pivots that you don't want to execute on. If you think you can resolve things, then maybe I'm wrong. I'm basing my advice on the fact that this is 24 months in — enough time for you to know how easy it'd be to get back to \"we like working together and are on a path to success.\" Now for the hard parts:\n* You want to act as professionally as possible in walking away. Communicate clearly, being fair to both yourself and the other people involved. I think it's easy to err to far on either side (either too defensive/passive \"nice to yourself\" or too deferential \"nice to others\").\n* It can be tempting to think of this is as your cofounder's fault, but that's not constructive, and it's better to learn toward your future actions. For example, how could you have seen this problem earlier? My guess is that you were never \"cofounder compatible,\" and this is a chance to get better at identifying that compatibility with others (useful for both startups and other jobs). It's not a fun situation, and I hope things go well for you. reply",

I've parted ways with cofounders in two of my five startups (they left, not me... I could afford a zero paycheck for a little while, they couldn't). In both cases we did better after the split. In both cases our original business idea didn't work out, and we were trying to stay alive. It felt like pivoting from idea to idea. Reality was it was just trying to sell and collect enough to make payroll in six weeks. So we went from whatever we were doing to custom dev shop... Survival mode sucks. When got down to a single founder, it wasn't that one person was right or wrong about what the business could do. It was that the business could execute well enough (without cofounders fighting and second guessing) so it could survive, and eventually find something to productize. reply",

If you both feel like the relationship is not salvageable, amicably walk away without burning the professional bridge (someone might ask her how you are to work with). If your heart is not 100% in it (for whatever reason) I'd suggest walking away. The opportunity cost of dragging the dead weight of a business that you're not bought into (and that you aren't seeing success with) is simply too high - and can have real life consequences (finances, stresses, etc). There's nothing wrong with walking away - there's a reason the overwhelming majority of startups fail. And most tiny startups fail due to co-founder relationships - doesn't have anything to do with PMF or anything. Think about it over a weekend - have the tough conversation(s) - don't burn the bridge.

          "text": "Mr Stuck, I went through this and have strong feelings about it. I think the most important answer is to a question you aren't asking. *How to predict market demand for a new product.* It sounds like neither you or your co-founder know how to do this, and that's the problem. I don't have enough context to understand if the differences between you and your co-founder are unreconcilable, if they are, then maybe the answer is to move on, but if you mostly get along but are just struggling with an extremely uncomfortable and challenging situation, then here are some things to consider... First off, learn about Nonviolent Communication. If both you and your co-founder are willing to adopt it, that should help you improve your collaboration. Next, you probably need to cut your burn down to near-zero if you haven't already. Even if you have a decent amount of cash, if you and your co-founder still have enough control to make this decision, lay off everyone that isn't essential to servicing existing customers. If you have no customers, then cut everyone. Cut down to the smallest possible burn you can, to give you the most possible runway. Then, address your complete lack of market research skills, either by committing wholeheartedly to learning how to do it yourselves, or by finding a third co-founder who is really good at it. What you need is someone who has a decent grasp of technology trends and value-overhang, and who is very good at doing market research interviews (customer discovery interviews), and thinking through lenses like Jobs to be Done Theory, Outcome Driven Innovation and Design Thinking. When I say market research I don't mean some proctor and gamble quant nerd, I mean a scrappy startup bloodhound. Not all \"business people\" are built the same, and it would be good for you to ramp up the resolution of your evaluations of people in these roles. Then you need to come together to pick a group of people to focus on for AT LEAST 3 months. These need to be people you can access and talk to many of, and people who you have good reason to believe are all doing or trying to do very similar things. Read more about jobs to be done theory if you don't know what I mean. Here are some examples: (Startup founders, insurance brokers, nurses, teachers, parents raising two or more toddlers, robotics engineers, etc. - PICK ONE). Ideally you want to pick people who have money to spend themselves, have some authority or influence over how some money is spent, or whose work is important enough that making them more productive would be exciting to people who have influence. For example, elementary school teachers are probably not as attractive as a market as university professors, and private school elementary teachers are probably better than public school. If your founder is sensitive about engaging in this process without certainty that you will find an opportunity that's big enough to justify the VC investment, then consider focusing on a group of people like described above with high economic leverage (e.g. fintech CEOs, data-center architects, etc.) ~ focus on a set of people doing similar things close to where the money is flowing fast. Once you pick the group of people, you need to resist the urge to come up with any product ideas. Your next step isn't to ideate or innovate or whatever, its to go and empathize with the people. Get really fucking curious about what the people actually care about. Find a way to not want them to have specific wants. Read this again: Set yourself up to be curious about these people's actual wants, while not wanting them to have certain wants. It's way more fun to talk to people this way, you won't have the tension of \"I hope they validate our idea\", and they will enjoy talking to you because it will feel like therapy to them if you do it right. Ask things like \"What's the most important thing to you that you are the least satisfied with?\", and \"What else?\", \"if you could wave a magic wand...?\", ask follow up questions, \"has anything changed about that recently? Is it getting worse? How does it work today? Why does it work that way? How important is that step?, etc.\", make sure you understand all their answers. Listen actively. Stay curious. Empathize. Consider reading The Mom Test. You will be better off paying the targeted interviewees hundreds of dollars to spend an hour talking to you (2-3x their hourly salary), than spending that money on employees helping you flail around. If you can get their time for free, great! Once you start targeting a specific problem, it makes more sense to not pay for their time, since the chance of solving the problem can become the new motivation for speaking with you. After you have talked to ~30 or so people like this, you are fairly likely to spot an opportunity (You have also started to develop a very valuable skill). What you are looking for is something that a decent segment (e.g. 30%+) of the sample consider the most important thing they are trying to get done that they are the least satisfied with, or at least in the top 3, and that you think you can make a huge impact on with some emerging tech. Whatever you do needs to genuinely seem 10x better from the customers perspective, because the new benefit has to be worth the risk of spending time and money on something unproven / doesn't exist yet. The best opportunities will come from when you can re-frame the problems they are struggling with and understand them better than any one of the people you interviewed, because you got some unique perspective from talking to many people. Just don't rush this, because it has to be grounded in the reality of their existing values. After you gain the insight and have designed a new approach that you are highly confident at least a handful of the people will be excited about, go back to them and validate it. Ask the hard and scary questions (now with all that validation tension again), that they can and will pay money for it, or fight hard to get other people to pay for it, etc. If you did everything right up to this point, at least a handful of people will start pulling the product out of you. When you reach this point, at least 90% of the problems you described will be gone and you will have new (slightly better) problems. This is startups. <3 If you can't bring yourself to do something at least close to what I described above, then you're probably better off moving on, since the odds of succeeding from your current situation by pure luck is near-zero. That said, I encourage you to take the courageous and responsible path if you have it in you, the world needs more of it, and you will grow a lot from it. Sincerely,\nFloorEgg reply",

          "text": "I agree that a debugger is a great tool; in particular, knowing how to set conditional breakpoints and how to read a stack trace allows you to do things that are nearly impossible in other ways. I can give a example story below, but first: There's a larger point here that *debugging methodology* in general is a key skill that many programmers seem to overlook or take for granted, and even think they are good at it while making wasteful mistakes -- real Dunning-Kruger material here. * I can't tell you the number of times I've seen developers get a hunch and waste too much time going down a rabbit hole, instead of devising a test to attempt to disprove the hypothesis before plowing into a huge code review and seeing ghosts in every shadow of the codebase. * Print statements for debugging aren't necessarily always the wrong tool, but the mindset should be that they are code and can have bugs too. Good debug logging should be part of the code telemetry infrastructure, so you can toggle it on/off. If it's going to be written and deleted, then use a debugger instead. Actually this post is getting long so I'll stop now, but I could go on for several paragraphs. Oh wait, I promised a debugger story. One time I started a new job, they assigned me a bug that other developers had spent a lot of time on but never resolved. It was a random crash, in a game, that rarely happened in less than 12 hours of continuous runtime, typically after 18 hours. The crash occurred even when the game was idle with no player input. The crash stack trace was very different in many instances, so the failure was happening some time/distance after its cause. My first pass was to devise tests to eliminate subsystems: try to repro the crash after disabling all graphics/animation, another test that disabled all audio/input, etc. That led to narrowing it down to a problem with the music. Telemetry showed no memory leaks, it was not running out of heap. The music playback was in a thread, double-buffered. I added a bunch of conditional breakpoints that were based on assert-like conditionals. One of those caught the interrupt happening in between two statements that should have been in a critical section. Instead of using a mutex around the whole thing, I just switched the double buffer logic to a queue, which resolved the problem. reply",

          "text": "While I do like LLMs for these tasks, unfortunately this one failed you but was a near enough miss that you couldn't see it. What you were really looking for is the Red Queen problem/hypothesis/race, named after a quote from Through the Looking Glass, with the Queen explaining to Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" In particular, the Red Queen term is specifically the equilibrium you inquired about, where relative fitness is unchanging, rather than the more general concept of an evolutionary arms race in which there can be winners and losers. The terms 'evolutionary equilibrium' and 'evolutionary steady state' are also used to capture the idea of the equilibrium, rather than just of competition. Evolutionary arms race is somewhat tautological; an arms race is the description of the selective pressure applied by other species on evolution of the species in question. (There are other, abiotic sources of selective pressures, e.g. climate change on evolutionary timescales, so while 'evolution' at least carries a broader meaning, 'arms race' adds nothing that wasn't already there.) That said, using your exact query on deepseek r1 and claude sonnet 3.7 both did include red queen in their answers, along with other related concepts like tit for tat escalation. reply",

          "text": "I disagree that evolutionary arms race is a specific term of art; we have many specific terms of art but 'arms race' is a broad generalization popularized by Dawkins as a pop science writer addressing a lay audience. Actual terms of art in this area would include Red Queen, the many individually termed coevolutions (antagonistic, mosaic, host-parasite, plant-herbivore, predator-prey etc), coadaptation, coextinction, the escalation hypothesis, frequency-dependent selection, reciprocal selection, asymmetric selection, the evolutionary lag, evolutionary cycling, character displacement, Fisherian runaway, evolutionary mismatch/trap, (phylogenetic) niche conservatism, fitness landscape, Grinnellian vs Eltonian niches, the competitive exclusion principle, and on and on. All of these actual terms of art fit under the broad, general umbrella of an 'arms race' with other species, which is really nothing more than a restatement of Spencer's unfortunate phrase. The latter is so widely 'known' that it is to the point that I and many of my peers try not to utter it, in an effort to reduce the work refuting the same tired misunderstandings that arise from that verbiage. At any rate, almost NONE of these actual terms of art are about the sort of equilibrium that was the exact heart of the OP's query to the LLM, and thus nearly none of the broader umbrella 'arms race' is about why the plant doesn't have the evolutionary pressure to actually drive the parasite extinct . An arms race doesn't have to be in equilibrium. Armor vs weapons were in an arms race and indeed at equilibrium for millenia, but then bullets come along and armor goes exinct almost overnight and doesn't reappear for 5 centuries. Bullets win the arms race. Arms races have nothing to do, inherently, with equilibrium. You seem to have misunderstood the nature of the equilibrium in a Red Queen scenario, which is the fundamental effect that the hypothesis is directly named for. That species that are in Red Queen relationships can go extinct is in no way a counterargument to the idea that two (or more) species tend to coevolve in such a way that the relative fitness of each (and of the system as a whole) stays constant. See, for example, the end of the first paragraph on the origin of Van Valen's term at your own wiki link. Evolutionary steady-state is a synonymous term without the baggage of the literary reference and also avoids the incorrect connotation suggested by arms race that leads people to forget the abiotic factors that are often a dominant mechanism in extinctions as the realized niche vs the fundamental niche differ. Instead, Van Valen was specifically proposing the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanation of why extinction appears to be a half-life, i.e. of a constant probability, rather than a rate that depends on the lifetime of the taxa. This mechanism has good explanatory power for the strong and consistent evidence that speciation rate (usually considered as the log of the number of genera, depending on definition, see Stanley's Rule) has a direct and linear relation with the extinction rate. If Red Queened species didn't go exinct, Van Valen wouldn't have needed to coin the term to explain this correlation. Or were you deliberately invoking Cunningham's Law? reply",

          "text": "It is extremely dangerous to believe that anything said by an AI assistant is correct. Even with supposedly authoritative peer-reviewed research papers it is extremely frequent to find errors whenever the authors claim to quote earlier work, because the reality is that most of them do not bother to read carefully their claimed bibliography. When you get an answer from an AI, the chances greatly increase that the answer regurgitates some errors present in the publications used for training. At least when you get the answer from a real book or research paper, it lists its sources and you can search them to find whether they have been reproduced rightly or wrongly. With an AI-generated answer it becomes much more difficult to check it for truthfulness. I will give an example of what I mean, on which I happened to stumble today. I have read a chemistry article published in 2022 in a Springer journal. While the article also contained various useful information, it happened to contain a claim that seemed suspicious. In 1782, the French chemist Guyton de Morveau has invented the word \"alumine\" (French) = \"alumina\" (Latin and English), to name what is now called oxide of aluminum, which was called earth of alum at that time (\"terra aluminis\" in Latin). The article from 2022 claimed that the word \"alumina\" had already been used earlier with the same sense, by Andreas Libavius in 1597, who has been thus the creator of this word. I have found this hard to believe, because the necessity for such a word has appeared only during the 18th century, when the European chemists, starting with the Swedish chemists, have finally gone beyond the level of chemical classification inherited from the Arabs and they have begun to classify all known chemical substances as combinations of a restricted set of primitive substances. Fortunately, the 2022 article had a detailed bibliography, and using it I was able to find the original work from 1597 and the exact paragraph in it that was referred to. The claim of the 2022 article was entirely false. While the paragraph contained a word \"alumina\", that was not a singular feminine adjective (i.e. agreeing with \"terra\") referring to the \"earth of alum\". Instead of this, it was not a new word, but just the plural of the neuter word \"alumen\" (= English alum), in the sentence \"alums or salts or other similar sour substances can be mixed in\", where \"alums\" meant \"various kinds of alum\", like \"salts\" meant \"various kinds of salt\". Nowhere in the work of Libavius there was any mention of an earth that is a component of alum and that could be extracted from alum (in older chemistry, \"earth\" was the term for any non-metallic solid substance that neither dissolves in water nor burns in air). I have given in detail this example, in order to illustrate the kinds of errors that I very frequently encounter whenever some authors claim to quote other works. While this was an ancient quotation, lots of similar errors appear when quoting more recent publications, e.g. when quoting Einstein, Dirac or the like. I am pretty sure that if I would ask an AI assistant something, the number of errors in the answers will not be less than when reading publications written by humans, but the answers will be more difficult to verify. Whoever thinks that they can get a quick answer to any important question in a few seconds and be done with it, are naive because the answer to any serious question must be verified thoroughly, otherwise there are great chances that those who trust such answers will just spread more disinformation, like the sources on which the AI has been trained. reply",

          "text": "Appreciate your perspective. To be clear, I'm using it to become a better small game developer and not relying on it to answer anything I would classify as an \"important question\". Moreover, I don't take everything AI tells me to be 100% accurate (and I never copy/paste the response). Rather, I use it as an assistant with which I can have a back and forth \"conversation\" to acquire other perspectives. Despite a lot of effort, I'm just not a highly skilled developer and I don't have any friends / colleagues I can turn to for assistance (I don't know a single software developer or even another person who enjoys video games). While resources like StackOverflow are certainly useful, having answers tailored to my specific situation really accelerates progress. I'm not trying to cure cancer here and much of what would be considered the \"best approach\" for a small game architecture is unique to the developer. As such, AI is an incredible resource to lean on and get information tailored to my unique use case (here is my code...how does {topic} apply to my situation?\") And yes, I find errors from time to time, but that is good. It keeps me on my toes and forces me to really understand the response / perspective. reply",

If I don't, I'll type some wordy long explanation of what I want into an LLM and hope for the best. The reason is pretty simple.  If the result you want is in the first few search hits, it's always better.  Your query is shorter so there is less typing, the search engine is always faster, the results are far better because you side step the LLM hallucinating as it regurgitates the results it remembers on the page your would have read if you searched. If you aren't confident of the search times, it can take 1/2 an hour of dicking around with different terms, clicking though a couple of pages of search results for each set of term, until you finally figure out the lingo to use.  Figuring out what you are really after from that wordy description is the inner magic of LLM's. reply",

Say, I search for how to do something in the Linux terminal (not just the command, but the specific options to achieve a certain thing). Google will often take me to pages that do have the answer, but are full of ads and fluff, and I have to browse through several options until I find the ones I want. ChatGPT just gives me the answer. And with any halfway decent model, hallucination only seems to be a problem in difficult or very specialized questions. Which I agree shouldn't be asked to LLMs (or not without verifying sources, at least). But over 90% of what I search aren't difficult or specialized questions, they're just things I have forgotten, or things that are easy but I don't know just because they're not in my area of expertise. For example as a learner of Chinese, I often ask it to explain sentences to me (translate the sentence, the individual words, and explain what a given word is doing in the sentence) and for that kind of thing it's basically flawless, there's no reason why it would hallucinate as such questions are trivial for a model having tons of Chinese text in its training set. reply",

Instead of finding a keyword optimized page for \"frob language\", I can get the objectively best sources for frob language and even find the best communities related to it. Zero frob ads, zero frob-optimized pages that are designed to trick google, etc. Traditional search is dead, semantic search through AI is alive and well. I can't yet count once AI misunderstood the meaning of my search while Google loves to make assumptions, rewrite my search query, and deliver the results that pay it the best which have the best ads (in my opinion as a lifetime user). Lets not even mention how they willingly accept misleading ads atop the results which trick the majority of common users into downloading malware and adware on the regular. reply",

I don't mind bash and the various cli programs I used to use for the tasks I was doing at the cli. However I was forced years ago to learn powershell. Now syntax aside I was able to use powershells native functionality to do things I'd have to call other programs for, read and process CSV, JSON, XML, etc. Nushell is like powershell but a much better syntax and I prefer the data model and love the output. My main workflows consist of exploring data, cleaning it, and outputting what I need. Nushell has this covered. reply",

          "text": "That’s a fair point — ecosystems naturally evolve with competing frameworks, and sometimes that diversity helps the best ideas emerge. But in those examples (PHP vs. .NET vs. Django, React vs. Angular), we usually see clear differences in philosophy, performance, developer experience, or use case fit. What I find puzzling in the current wave of AI agent libraries is that many seem to be doing almost exactly the same thing — wrapping LLMs, defining tools, planning steps — just with slightly different APIs or names. It’s hard to see a fundamental divergence in capability or vision, at least so far. So my question is less about why variety exists — and more about whether this current fragmentation is actually productive, or just noise driven by branding and platform lock-in strategies. Would love to be wrong here if others are seeing more substantial innovation beneath the surface. reply",

Ideally, my friends are going to push me in the same way that a manager would anyway. I don’t want to stay stagnant in my ideas or performance. There are limits of course, but generally I trend towards progress and self betterment. I had a rough patch at work last year that ultimately culminated in a sit down with my manager. We talked about what was contributing to my performance and the expectations moving forward. It wasn’t bitter or angry, there was no yelling or screaming, just an honest conversation and an acknowledgment of reality. Hopefully I have the opportunity to pay it back over the coming years.

On a small, focused team where all members were highly experienced & competent specialists, the good manager kept the team focused on the actual business goal we were trying to solve, and especially by making decisions in the times when the team didn't have a clear consensus about how to approach something. Sometimes it's more important that a decision be clearly made than that it be exactly correct, and having someone with the authority to do that and the willingness to take responsibility for the consequences is incredible for team morale. But most of the time the team will come to a solution on their own and the manager can  be part of that but also be able to step back and let it happen. And then sometimes it's more important that the decision be exactly correct than that it be made quickly, and an individual with practiced discernment between these situations is a treasure. In a bigger company my best manager understood their role as a primarily political one mediating the needs of their team (both as a team and as individuals) with the sometimes contradictory needs of the broader business. They \"manage up\" by presenting the team's work to leadership in a way where leadership can understand the value of the team's work. And they \"manage down\" by contextualizing business decisions to get team buy in when possible, and just generally being a buffer between the changing whims of leaders and the daily work of the team. Blocking interruptions, arguing about whether things should be done, taking the heat when things go wrong. reply",

          "text": "Looking back at what my best managers (I have two) had in common: * Cared deeply about my personal progress. Not just at work but in life. Am I feeling okay? How are things going? What are your interests? Are you doing what is interesting to you? Both of them became actual friends outside of work once I left one of the companies, and the other manager left the company I was at during that time. * Treated me as an equal and used their power in my favor. Bad project? Moved me off it. Salary problems? Fought for a raise. Needed to skill up? Got me what I needed whether it was books, or classes, or whatever. * Didn't bother much about using 1:1s for \"business\". It was my time, and they made sure I used it how I wanted. If I wanted to wax poetic about my hobby project for 30 minutes I could. Importantly both of them understood that what I was doing for the company was a JOB and there were no qualms about that. \"Careers\" do not exist anymore. This refreshing reality and human feel is something pinhead middle managers I've had since seem to miss. reply",

          "text": "There are almost none because everything goes obsolete in a month. In 6 months, it's deprecated. Nearly every book or guide you find will be outdated by the time it's released and the people who write them are getting exhausted with this loop. I once wrote slides on how to give AI context so it can code. When I asked a friend to proofread it, GPT-4 came out and it was smart enough to make all my techniques obsolete. I updated my workflow for it, and then Cursor came out, basically automating all the indexing and stuff in seconds while I'd take days. There's YouTube, but they tend to be brief and look like hype or unedited. Most of the good stuff is experimental, but experimental isn't helpful and shouldn't be. If you want names: techfren and Sabrina Ramonov The new GPT-4o image update is just amazing. It compounds with the new memory update less 24 hours ago. I could write pages about why but I'd rather just make stuff with it. Anyone who's getting excited about it but not using it is a bit of a hypocrite. Just treat it like a skateboard. No book. You'll fall many times at first. Have fun with it. You don't have to go anywhere, just go around the block. Join one of the many hackathons out there and do something with it. It'll click. Make good use of Cunningham's Law - just exclaim that it can't do Y, and someone will explain how it does Y. Like the skater community, people want to see you do tricks. reply",

          "text": "I freakin' hate telephones, and I always have, and the Dowager Countess of Grantham was correct in surmising that they are torture devices of the highest caliber. I always try to prefer virtual meetings with video and all the trimmings, especially screen-share capability. If not, in-person. Telephoning is like a last resort. I've pondered using TTY/TDD even though I have no physical impairments, but most agencies seem hostile to that sort of barrier and most of the time, I find myself needing to pass voice-recognizing gatekeeper AIs first. When I was promoted to \"sysadmin\" in my first job they set me at a desk with a computer and a PBX telephone. (It was an office at a gov't defense contractor...) The computer I could relate to on an intimate level; the telephone scared the living bejesus out of me, and I prayed it never to ring. A disembodied voice in your ear, especially one that interrupts everything you're doing and demanding a real-time conversation across space and time, that's incredibly rude, yet normalized for 100 years. I have PTSD and other disabilities, and I can get completely rattled and downright hostile/aggro when someone calls me and I'm not prepared, I'm not at my desk, no notes in front of me, even if I'm relaxing at home I just can't deal. I may answer the phone while on a bus or train, but I certainly won't sustain a conversation that way. Outgoing calls are sometimes OK but often end in disaster as I become increasingly frustrated. Now it's not uncommon for someone who's standing at my front door to telephone me. What the hell, I'm less than 3 yards away in here, please don't send me across Cyberspace when you're manifesting in meatspace... On a phone call I have no idea what office I've reached, what is a person's job title or role with a company, what their face looks like, when they may be taking a breath or using other physical cues to aid the conversation. So much metadata is lost in phone conversations that they are wholly dehumanized and require a revolution in etiquette, just to keep the peace. Here's your uptalk origin: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb21lsCQ3EM&si=3j3bYd_0rPa... \"Valley Girl, she's a Valley Girl!\" I'm not autistic and I can read expressions and body language, but perhaps autists are the evolutionary result of disembodied telephone conversations taking out the human element from verbal communication. It is simply amazing that even with apps and ubiquitous Internet and website portals that I still require the telephone to get important business done (and I'm always, always ticking \"it's something else/other/Live Agent/Oh god this is an exception to all your rules please send me a human being\"). reply",

But the tell tones of a Malaysian accent is it's clipped. Instead of \"I don't like that idea,\" it becomes \"Don't like it.\" ChatGPT may be written American, so as an accent, it would sound closer to, \"I- don't like, that idea.\" And sentences often end in an elongated manner, \"I wrote that is essay you wanted~\".

It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind. Uninstall those apps (and others) if they’re making you worse. reply",

Expect to continue the grind for many many months. Expect to get rejected not for not meeting the bar, but for not exceeding everyone else who also passed that bar. Expect to very likely settle for a job that doesn’t meet the expectations that college (and the previous 10+ years of history) sold you on. Expect that financially, you will end up years behind the curve and that many life plans (ex: home ownership if that’s one of your goals) will be delayed. Expect that you will meet many people younger than you who will be at your financial level because they graduated post-recovery. If you can accept that you just happen to be born at the wrong time, you will be in a better place mentally than where I was at for a long time. I won’t say it’s easy; it will suck. But it is possible to make it out ok. I luckily had some financial and emotional support from my family to keep me going. I don’t know your situation but hopefully you are able to find support too. I wish you the best of luck. reply",

You can get a 1st in CS and be a rubbish programmer, you can get a chemistry degree and be an amazing one. A lot of CS is utterly irrelevant to programming, and the vast majority of programming skills are not covered by CS degree. Once you're past 2-3 years experience it stops being relevant, before that it's a way to filter CVs by managers who want to pretend their CS degree wasn't a complete waste of time. If they're asking for a CS degree for a senior role it's basically advertising they're a clueless company. reply",

This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. I'm going to challenge this as you didn't give specific data to back it up. I read an article recently that did have data, and it made the argument that first jobs, and first salaries, tend to be remarkably \"sticky\". That is, if you are desperate for a job out of college so take one that causes you to be underemployed and underpaid, that doesn't just stick with you for your first job, but data showed that people were underemployed and underpaid for at least a decade after college. The advice in this article was to hold out as long as possible for a desirable job, which meant a ton of networking, taking internships if possible, and also possibly additional schooling. Apologies for not having the article on hand, but here's another one I found in 30 seconds of googling that makes the same argument, with research: https://www.highereddive.com/news/half-of-graduates-end-up-u... reply",

Post-graduation, and especially post-college, people don't have these same opportunities. Fwiw, I'd lean very heavily into interning.

Never did get to realize that dream of coding professionally. I believe he finally gave up studying & interviewing for junior dev jobs in 2016. At that point why take a \"stale\" graduate when you can just get an actual 22 year old from the same school, seems to have been everyone's reasoning. I saw a similar thing a bunch when teaching at a code school ca 2018 too. It was a great move if you had savings or support for 6-18 months of job search. The ones that got in are still doing ok. But a lot didn't, they had to keep working at what they did before \"temporarily\" while interviewing and most of them are still doing exactly that. So idk, I'm not sure how you would even get numbers on this. How many people would have excelled in this work if they had graduated at a different time, or with more support, but they didn't and they simply aren't here. reply",

Talk to folks you know that graduated before you and have a job. Talk to professors who might have industry ties in their history. Talk to folks in the career center. Try to be as visible as you can. Yes, I know that seems trivial considering you don't have job experience, but even building relationships at school can pay off. Those types of connections are CRITICAL in the age of scorched-earth AI centric hiring. I spent 9 months recently jobless after getting laid off, and its damned near impossible to get a job through the usual resume farm (LinkedIn job board and the like). Also, look for jobs local to wherever you are that don't look all that glamorous. RTO is a big thing now, and smaller organizations struggle to hire locally without the brand recognition of the big guys. That might be your in for your first job. And the biggest thing, keep your head up. Keep pushing. You just got a degree from an extremely difficult program, and you can hang your hat on that. The factors affecting the job market are not within your control, and your skills will outlast them. reply",

Sometimes just asking the right people works, but obviously you have to know who to ask, when to ask it, and how to ask it to make it work.  There are also more passive methods like the HN monthly job threads, but you should do active networking as your primary networking method in this job market. Even if I apply via a job board to positions that I am supremely qualified for, there is a good chance I'll be auto-rejected within a day.  It has happened multiple times to me and I shrug it off at this point. I know networking is hard, especially when you are just starting out, but I just wanted to write a post saying that it does work if you stick to it. (That said, I would also prepare to be unemployed for an extended period.  Even if you are actively interviewing, it can take months to get a job offer.  For my current position, it took 5 months to get an offer and I started 4 months later due to a housing storage where the job was located.) reply",

If you go through this chain of thought you arrive at conclusion, everyone is inferior to one another. The material superiority you yearn for is a momentary fleet in the river of time. Sometimes just reflect on yourself. One perspective of life is your world governs you. If you are happy in your own world, try to let go of it. Just enjoy the moments and don't hold on it. You are the actor and creator of your reality. Your objective reality is making you feel inferior. Define your role, change your actions, and act accordingly. The inability to act according to your role is the probably reason behind your feeling. You probably see yourself through some different lens where your actions and objective reward do not align. All you can do is control your thoughts and actions. So act. reply",

          "text": "Thinking is moot though.  What’s going on at the moment is about Trumps raw power.  As much as the markets prefer stability, everything is relative, so he still has the power to move the markets just by signaling different things moment to moment.  Of course this is not sustainable over the long run, but the American economy is certainly meta enough at this point that it’s very hard to guarantee the repercussions will land while he is still alive/in-office. I hope in the long term the voting public can come back around to the idea that character and thoughtfulness still have a place in politics, but that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest, intellectuals and experts have lost credibility with the public at large, and therefore trust in leadership is entirely based on superficial vibes and talking points that can resonate in a 5-10 second TikTok-ready take. reply",

          "text": "> that might just be wishful thinking in a social/AI age where real truth in any particular domain is too complex for individuals to digest It's not necessarily that you're smarter, but you have different preferences and concerns given your circumstances. If you're a low-paid worker you're likely very vulnerable and exposed globalisation. Globalisation is great because it means all the bad jobs low-paid workers used to do can be done even cheaper abroad, but if you're one of those workers you have to watch your opportunities drying up. Not sure it's going to happen now, but there was a hope that with places like India coming online even some of the more expensive digital jobs can now more easily be outsourced would be a huge boom for the IT sector which has historically had to pay very high salaries to employ skilled workers in the West. But again, whether this is good or not really depends on if you're one of the workers in these sectors – if you are you might think that we should protect jobs even if it is bad for GDP. Plus if you're poor already you're not going to care much about an economic crash because you have no real stake in the economy. Even if this is a bad way to look at it because things can always get worse, the immediate impact of the DOW dropping isn't going to bother you if you have no assets. Not all, but many people who voted Trump don't want a stable thoughtful character who will continue with the status-quo with a few minor adjustments. They actually want a mad man who will disrupt everything. Many even want the DOW to tank – we're seeing this sentiment all over places like X right now. I live in the UK, but I saw the same kind of thing with Brexit too. Middle-class people understood immigration and the EU was good because immigration increased GDP and it meant those who went to university could study and work abroad. But these types of arguments are not very convincing for someone who is poor and on welfare (which would be over 50%+ of UK households). Politics needs to be discussed from a different perspective. Arguing something is bad for investors or GDP isn't going to convince people who are poor when the people on the other side of the argument are saying it's going to be good for jobs and the average American. Of course whether that's actually true or not is another conversation, but that's the way arguments need to be framed. reply",

The goal of the tarrifs is to drive up consumer prices (to the point where local production is attractive. ) But local production takes time to create, so in the meantime they'll have to buy less. Once local production is in place, that will price output at market levels (meaning it stays expensive. ) The market for, say coffee, will fluctuate and production will rebalance somewhat.
