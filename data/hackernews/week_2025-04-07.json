          "text": "Truly sorry you feel this way. For what it’s worth, this was common for people graduating into the 2008 financial crisis, too. It’s actually unusual that we went for so long without another period of contraction. From last time around: The people who kept pushing and took any job, anywhere turned out okay. This translated to a lot of people taking jobs below what they expected to get or having to move when they didn’t want to, but it was ultimately temporary. The people I knew who turned cynical, let negativity take the wheel, and checked out of the job market struggled much harder to get back in. You’re early in your career. This current period of turmoil doesn’t mean that much, even though it feels like everything right now. Keep at it, work a little harder than your competition, and put a little more care into your applications and it will work out. Stay away from the doom spirals on Reddit or Blind. Uninstall those apps (and others) if they’re making you worse. reply",

          "text": "Feser's very good at explaining Thomistic/Aristotelian metaphysics clearly.  His _Aquinas: A Beginner's Guide_ is a good introduction. The point of Thomistic/Aristotelian metaphysics it not that it's useful for building things; it isn't, which is why the early moderns mostly abandoned it.  But physics and the quantitative/mechanistic view of the world that it fosters is an abstraction from reality--an extremely useful and productive one, granted, but still an abstraction.  It leaves things out that Thomistic metaphysics retains; and while Aristotelian science has been left in the dust, his metaphysics still has important things to say. Modern philosophy embraced the mechanistic view of the world with Descartes, leading to a number of philosophical problems (the mind-body problem, the problem of other minds, how to account for qualia and consciousness, and so forth) that are amply accounted for in the older philosophy. reply",

I've only started to dip into various parts, but I can already confirm that it is a good introductory compendium of the basics of philosophy, logic, and argumentation. In the same vein is Daniel Dennett's Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking . A personal favorite is Frances  Yates's The Art of Memory (think: intersection of rhetoric, mnemonic systems, philosophical systems, and the occult during the Renaissance). Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography and Typography for Lawyers . Bryan Garner's The Winning Brief . Umberto Eco's How to Write a Thesis . Adler's How to Read a Book . Pierre Bayard's How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read . I could go on. Book posts are my favorite posts on HN, but they always lighten my wallet and at home I'm surrounded with ever-growing piles of great material. reply",

We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve and providers get paid fairly! To do so, we're debugging core problems in the US healthcare system with a modern tech stack and AI.

We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have more than 300 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying.

Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great addition to your team. I have over 15 years of experience with Ruby.

My main focus is scaling the ticketing system and making sure it can handle massive workloads efficiently. That experience turned me into a bit of a Rails performance nerd—so much so that I wrote a book about it, Rails Scales!, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf ( https://pragprog.com/titles/cprpo/rails-scales/ ). I’ve also had the chance to share my insights at conferences like RailsConf, EuRuKo, and RubyKaigi.

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

I am a senior full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building applications for the United States weather service (NOAA, NWS, OHD, NOMADS, etc.), Minnesota schools, and non-profit organizations. I started out building front-end apps and grew to love the back-end/cloud as well (it is so nice to write database/API/CMS/cloud helper programs quickly in Node, Python, Go, C++, etc.!). My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a suite of old applications. I am flexible and love wearing many hats of technologies & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on challenging tickets (for example: I built a node.js helper application to migrate 10,000+ vanilla JS/HTML web pages to a tricky CMS). I'm all sparkles when it comes to full-stack development! I am actively looking for remote full-time or contract work. While that for loop is running, I am deep diving into new tech/AI && full stack projects, such as the Stone King Wiki, Magic: The Gathering Assistant v2, and a touch-focused app similar to what Hans Zimmer uses as the primary console for extending his music composition capabilities. reply",

I most recently worked in a UX-centric engineering role at a gaming company and also have prior experience at an early-stage start-up developing a biotech SaaS. I have a graduate-level education in information science from an R1 university alongside degrees and research experience in the health sciences. To be very transparent, I’ve been unemployed for a while after operations for my previous company moved overseas and it's been tough trying to get back into the industry. I took time off to refine my computer science knowledge and get more confident in my engineering skills. I am really looking to break back into tech in a less design-focused role. Please send me a message if you know of any opportunities! Open to connecting on LinkedIn also. :) Thank you! reply",

          "text": "Hi teleforce, thanks! Your project sounds very interesting as well. That actually reminds me, at one point, a researcher suggested looking into geophone or fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data that oil companies sometimes collect in Alaska, potentially for tracking animal movements or impacts, but I never got the chance to follow up. Connecting seismic activity data (like yours) with potential effects on animal vocalizations or behaviour observed in acoustic recordings would be an interesting research direction! Regarding data access: Our labeled dataset (EDANSA, focused on specific sound events) is public here: https://zenodo.org/records/6824272 . We will be releasing an updated version with more samples soon. We are also actively working on releasing the raw, continuous audio recordings. These will eventually be published via the Arctic Data Center (arcticdata.io). If you'd like, feel free to send me an email (address should be in my profile), and I can ping you when that happens. Separately, we have an open-source model (with updates coming) trained on EDANSA for predicting various animal sounds and human-generated noise. Let me know if you'd ever be interested in discussing whether running that model on other types of non-stationary sound data you might have access to could be useful or yield interesting comparisons. reply",

          "text": "Hi d_burfoot, really appreciate you bringing that up! The idea of pre-training a big foundation model on our raw data using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (kind of like how GPT emerged in NLP) is definitely something we've considered and experimented with using transformer architectures. The main hurdle we've hit is honestly the scale of relevant data needed to train such large models from scratch effectively. While our ~19.5 years dataset duration is massive for ecoacoustics, a significant portion of it is silence or ambient noise. This means the actual volume of distinct events or complex acoustic scenes is much lower compared to the densely packed information in the corpora typically used to train foundational speech or general audio models, making our effective dataset size smaller in that context. We also tried leveraging existing pre-trained SSL models (like Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT for speech), but the domain gap is substantial. As you can imagine, raw ecoacoustic field recordings are characterized by significant non-stationary noise, overlapping sounds, sparse events we care about mixed with lots of quiet/noise, huge diversity, and variations from mics/weather. This messes with the SSL pre-training tasks themselves. Predicting masked audio doesn't work as well when the surrounding context is just noise, and the data augmentations used in contrastive learning can sometimes accidentally remove the unique signatures of the animal calls we're trying to learn. It's definitely an ongoing challenge in the field! People are trying different things, like initializing audio transformers with weights pre-trained on image models (ViT adapted for spectrograms) to give them a head start. Finding the best way forward for large models in these specialized, data-constrained domains is still key. Thanks again for the suggestion, it really hits on a core challenge! reply",

We've actually updated it with more samples since the initial release, and getting the new version out is on my to-do list. Polli.ai looks fantastic! It's genuinely exciting to see more people tackling the ecological monitoring challenge with hardware/software solutions. While I know the startup path in this space can be tough financially, the work is incredibly important for understanding and protecting biodiversity. Keep up the great work! reply",

          "text": "Not be negative about bestfreevoice, or any other invoicing tool, but it always seems like developers and early-stage entrepreneurs don't understand invoicing. First major disconnect is that not every country uses invoices, but may use receipts instead. This is true for the USA for example, so many US devs (for example: Stripe in the early days) are not familiar with the concept of invoicing. Technically there is no difference between receipts and invoices, so if you're not familiar with the concept of invoicing, just read this post with /s/invoice/receipt in mind. The point about invoicing is to act as a non-mutable entry into the ledgers of both parties (seller and buyer). In most countries (especially EU) invoices are mandated by law for B2B transactions, and so is keeping accounts (aka bookkeeping). So for invoicing to be practical it needs to be tied to your books/accounts. Because of this, any business will use some bookkeeping/accounting software, which will have invoicing capabilities built-in. Invoicing as a standalone product doesn't make sense if you have to import it all into your ledgers later. Then there is the 'design' trap, which many invoicing startups seem to fall for. Invoices are weird things. They are basically very, very inefficient artefacts from the past. An invoice is just a very little amount of transaction data exchanged between buyer and seller. In the days of physical bookkeeping (actual paper books) paper invoices made sense, but nowadays it is all done digitally. So the invoice is effectively a machine-2-machine interface, but for all sorts of legacy reasons we still wrap them in PDF with a fancy design that looks great for humans, but it effectively impossible for machines to read. There are all sorts of attempts made to improve upon this situation (like OCR, and nowadays AI to extract data from PDF invoices). There are open structured data formats such as UBL to replace / augment PDF invoices, but due to all sorts of politics and lobbying the open standards have been doomed from the beginning. There is a lot of money made in accounting software, and they all rely on vendor lock-in. The major accounting software vendors have very strong incentives to keep us from adopting UBL et al, and most of the established accounting product suck, but you can't easily migrate so you'll be stuck with it. If you run or own a business, treat your books as an asset of your business, a very important asset for that matter. Books are kept in accounting software, which is typically part of a larger software suite which also features tax filing, HRM, asset management, invoicing, etc. In fancy business terms this is often called ERP. But think of ERP as just your central database, or your 'books'. Choosing your accounting software an important decision. Choose accounting software that allows exporting your data (very important!), that has an API (also very important), and preferably a web interface. It should be always available, so on-premise software is out. \nFor entrepreneurs: choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). Don't let an accountant recommend your software either, they get huge kickbacks from the software vendors (vendor lock-in).\nEvery sale—whether this being PoS, invoicing, or a payment integration like Stripe—should automatically registered as a ledger entry in the books, preferably with an invoice document attached. Here you can see why an accountant who keeps your books in their systems won't work, you don't want to be stuck having to periodically send an email (or shoebox) filled with invoices for them to process. Your books should be owned by the business, should be automated (at least for the receivable side), and always be up-to-date. You can then give an(y) accountant access to your books for them to do audits, tax filings, etc. For a business, the books are the central database of the business, everything else revolves around it. Do not be tempted to write your own, instead integrate with existing solutions while avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible. Integrating your business with the accounting software is an ever-ongoing part of your software development efforts, so not underestimate it. Accepting payments is hard, making sure it is well registered in your books is equally hard. It takes _much_ more time than you'd think (most first-time entrepreneurs actually don't consider it at all). There are no silver bullets here. reply",

          "text": "In Italy, many of these invoicing challenges have already been tackled through a nationwide standardized system. Every invoice—whether B2B or even B2C (receipts included)—must be sent electronically using a government-defined XML format. This invoice includes predefined metadata and is digitally signed by the issuing party. Once ready, it gets submitted to the national tax agency’s centralized system, called the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which validates and registers it before forwarding it to the recipient. This system essentially acts as a clearinghouse: it ensures all invoices go through the same format, are verifiably issued, and are automatically recorded on both ends. For consumers (B2C), the invoice still goes through the same pipeline and is made available in their personal portal on the IRS website, while the seller can still email a copy (PDF) for convenience. This centralized and machine-readable approach has eliminated a lot of the fragmentation seen elsewhere. There’s no vendor lock-in, no OCR, and no AI needed to parse PDFs—just a signed XML file going through a common pipeline. It’s not perfect, but it shows how much smoother things can be when the rules (and formats) are defined at the infrastructure level. reply",

          "text": "While all well and true. Some scale is assumed. There’s plenty of need for basic use invoicing like this. Generate an invoice as a way to bill someone or serve as an estimate for work/project cost. Not everyone is at a place where it needs to be so formal and integrated into a complete solution that tracks the dollars from invoice to balance sheet to income statement, etc. It’s a lot especially for people that are just freelancing and need a similar probably infrequent way to send a bill. They probably are just tracking things in a spreadsheet and not even big enough to use quickbooks or anything else. It would be a poor use of time and over engineering to put that all in place and setup things that cost subscription dollars in perpetuity just to bill for a one off charge. Or even a handful of them. When I think of people I pay, my lawn guy and my housekeeper both just text me how much I owe them. Then I zelle them. They both have dozens of clients at least and I imagine they are doing this way for them all. If I were a business, in May insist on getting an invoice to load the AP into an accounting flow from my end but they wouldn’t really want to change their system of doing things just to comply with my request. So, they may want something like this that just basically converts the text message info into an official looking invoice. I feel the real problem is everyone is assuming this side project type thing to solve every edge case that exists in the world. Even the bigger guys like stripe. That’s the wrong take. They offer a solution, you have to evaluate of it fits your needs, if not, use something else. If you’re in a locale that mandates something completely different, use something else.

There are plenty countries where the vendor will charge the account of the customer, like a 'pull' mechanism. In many countries they'll use (or used) checks/cheques for that, or a different payment account like a credit card. The agreement for this would have been a contract. They may still use invoices for larger transactions, but they aren't always required by law. I remember that in the old days, Google, Stripe, etc wouldn't send invoices, sometimes you'd get a minimal receipt message by email, but that was about it. This was particularly annoying for EU-based companies where there are minimal requirements for invoices and/or receipts. Times have changed though. Most companies, including US-based, will now offer invoices that comply with most international regulations. Except PayPal of course, for some reason they still seem to get away with not offering invoices. You'll have to download your monthly account overview in PDF from their merchant portal, and they just slapped the following text on it: \"This statement may serve as a receipt for accounting and tax related purposes.\". reply",

          "text": ">choose your own accounting software, do not be tempted to hire an external bookkeeper that keeps the books in 'their' systems (accountant lock-in). ~30 years ago I worked at a very small business (3 employees) and they used and liked Quickbooks.  The accountant convinced them to switch to some \"better\" system and for around 3 months they had no idea how much money they had, they just lost all visibility into the system because it didn't work in the way they expected.  \"If things didn't look right, we'd just go through every screen in the system and press Post.\"  At the end of those 3 months they realized they had unexpectedly gotten into $70K in debt -- this was ~35 years ago when a house was around that much.  They had to take a second mortgage on their house.  Eventually, they figured out the accounting system, righted the ship, and paid back the second mortgage over a few years.  Y2K really helped, with that giant bump in sales. reply",

          "text": "I built a machine learning library [1] (similar to PyTorch's API) entirely from scratch using only Python and NumPy. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd project [2]. I slowly added more functionality and evolved it into a fully functional ML library that can build and train classical CNNs [3] to even a toy GPT-2 [4]. I wanted to understand how models learn, like literally bridging the gap between mathematical formulas and high-level API calls. I feel like, as a beginner in machine learning, it's important to strip away the abstractions and understand how these libraries work from the ground up before leveraging these \"high-level\" libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Oh I also wrote a blog post [5] on the journey.

          "text": "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game. I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let’s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it’s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want. This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card. All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build. I’m under no impression I’ll directly compete, but it’s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it’s all MIT, you can fork and sell. It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client. Eventually I’d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want. Want to play from the CLI, sure reply",

I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs. The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily. I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system.

They might do okay, even pretty well, at combat maps and/or character sheets, but I want is the whole game world in the computer. Maps are just a fraction of what I need as a GM. I need data on economics and population numbers and power structures. And I need computation over all those things. For instance, my game rules include an economic subsystem, which takes in the production of goods and services at hundreds of in-game cities, and computes prices for over a thousand player-purchaseable goods. The \"second app\" that I referred to above allows players to (among many other things) purchase stuff at the market nearest their current location and have those items go straight into their character sheet. If the \"item\" is actually an animal, a hired mercenary, etc. then a different subsystem generates a new NPC with the right statistics and attaches the player to it as owner/liege. I could write an extension for a VTT that talks to my economic system over an API, and throws items up on screen, lets players purchase them, moves them into their character sheet using the right function calls in the VTT's extension library, etc. But every step of the way, I would be fighting to cram this subsystem into the VTT's conception that gameplay begins and ends with maps and char sheets. reply",

The only drawback with the docs is they don't focus on correctness and potential concurrency bugs sufficiently. In the very least the stdlib could mark whether particular functions are goroutine safe or not. If you stay guarded for such things, you should be able to get a lot done with very few mistakes. I have limited experience with Rust, but the ownership model and the borrow checker help with avoiding concurrency bugs as well. And personally for me, Rust slowed down the speed at which I could proceed solving the problem at hand.

          "text": "You're a frontend web developer, so I'm assuming you're going to want to work in the areas of either: 1) application security engineering\n2) application penetration testing\n3) devsecops\n4) vulnerability management It really is a big difference from each person on how they \"break into\" it. You've got great foundational qualifications, and probably just need to layer on extra \"security\" ones, if you don't already have them. If you're looking to start a company / start freelancing -- I've got no clue about that though. If you're just dipping your toes further into the web app security side, OWASP has great labs, resources, etc. They have the WSTG (more for pentesters) and ASVS (more for devs), and of course their cheat sheets as well. PortSwigger has great resources to read through on vulnerabilities and labs that will cover a ton of different vulnerabilities. HackTheBox also offers certification pathways: CBBH and CWEE, CBBH is more beginner/intermediate and involves a blackbox approach, where CWEE is more whitebox (from what it looks like). Just because systems have gaps, doesn't mean the orgs actually want help with those gaps, esp. unsolicited. You could always take a look at bug bounty as well (through HackerOne or BugCrowd), but it can be pretty brutal for a beginner as it can involve a ton of recon or \"going deep\" to reach untouched areas of an app. reply",

It’s probably due to a few famous projects being massively successful (think Vue.js), but I believe it’s directly tied to the project's size (audience), the maintainers' activities (conferences, etc.), and the type of audience. This last point is important—individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere with analytics (CTR, etc.) to justify it, which is basically advertising. I have a sizeable seven-year-old open-source project (Mockoon) and, over its lifetime, I’ve received low four figures in donations, which is awesome, but far from enough to make a living from it. Now, I’m creating a cloud version of the software, which has started generating revenue. It’s a lot of work, but leveraging the open-source success and sell something seems like a safer path. reply",

The only people who think you can make a living from Open Source (without working for a corporate) has never bothered to try. The number who have done it is a rounding error from zero. It's quite literally the hardest way to make money in software. >> individuals are more likely to donate, while companies often need months of convincing, and it usually doesn't work, or they expect their logo everywhere Companies cannot donate. People make donations, not companies. The only way to get a person at a company to send you money is by sending them an invoice for pretty much anything . Since you're giving the code away for free, advertising is pretty much all what you've got left to sell. Repeat after me - Donations are not a business model. It's a hobby model.

Seems fairly important to somehow write or talk about what you do[1].  Building stuff and never telling anyone about it never got anyone paid.  You don't need to become a shill, but the world needs to learn about what you're doing.  Will say with full certainty I would not have been able to quit my job and do this full time if I didn't blog about my misadventures. Risk of this being mostly survivorship bias, but I think in general it's helpful to build something that's more of an end product and not a library or some other widget in the making of products.  Possibly also helpful if yours is an ambitious project that somehow seems doable. Ladybird is possibly an even better case of this going well.  Exception possibly being if you end up as a linchpin tech like curl. In general I don't think patreon/github/etc. donations will ever add up to much than coffee money.

But I saw this talk by Evan Czaplicki (author of Elm) a while ago.[1] The talk is primarily about the economics of open-source programming languages, but I think that a lot of the issues discussed overlap with other areas of OSS. From the description of the youtube video: > In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!) > We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations? > My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

Here’s how you can make it work: Bounties & Sponsored Issues – Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Bountysource, and Gitcoin offer paid opportunities to fix issues, build features, or improve security in open-source projects. Prioritize projects with active communities and funding. Donations & Sponsorships – Set up GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon. This requires consistently contributing to high-impact projects and building a personal brand around your work. Hackathons & Grants – Many OSS-focused hackathons and grants (like those from Mozilla, Linux Foundation, or NLnet) provide funding for impactful contributions. Target projects that align with grant programs. Freelance Consulting & Custom Features – Companies often use open-source software but need custom solutions. If you’re an active contributor, businesses may pay for enhancements, bug fixes, or integration support. Crowdfunding Specific OSS Projects – If you build something valuable (like a plugin, CLI tool, or framework extension), you can crowdfund its development via Kickstarter or similar platforms. Merge-First Mindset – The key to sustaining this lifestyle is ensuring your PRs actually get merged. Engage with maintainers, follow their contribution guidelines, and build a reputation for delivering high-quality, non-disruptive code. Content & Community Engagement – Write blogs, create tutorials, or host livestreams showcasing your contributions. Visibility brings opportunities. It’s not the easiest path, but if you have the skills and discipline, you can make a living while staying independent. reply",

          "text": "Since you mentioned hackathons - A few years ago I was working on a game for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and I ended up going to EthDenver. While there, I discovered a rich and vibrant hackathon scene with a lot of monetary prizes. The hackathons were often for various blockchain platforms and, thus, those prizes were generally awarded in whatever cryptocurrency was native to that platform. From their point of view, it was a smart move. They create a network, retain a huge block of pre-minted currency, establish a market price, and then give out that currency as hackathon awards. As a competitor, you can cash you winnings in right away, so it works well enough. A friend and I cleared almost $30k one year in various contests. Unfortunately, winning a hackathon was often more about creating something that would make for good marketing buzz rather than creating something truly novel or even useful. And, frankly, the actual quality of your execution rarely mattered. We lost one contest where we had a fully working prototype deployed and live but lost to teams with ideas that sounded fun but were technically unfeasible. Still, if you're willing to play the game, it seems there's money to be made. My friend and I have since moved on and have not continued to participate - but it sure made for fun memories. reply",

Nearly every piece of code I write at work is part of one of those public, Apache-licensed code bases. Which means I spend most of my time working on OSS. Are these projects the kind of thing anyone else will ever use? Probably not, so long as the company stays in business. The business case my team made was focused on transparency and long-term viability: our customers can see exactly what we're doing with their data and how our systems work, and if we go under, they have a realistic way to continue using our software. This hasn't ended up being a huge selling point, but customers have definitely mentioned it as one of the things they liked about us. reply",

I continued to contribute to OSS by day tho as I would try upstreaming changes / fixes At PeerDB (now ClickHouse) I'm again in OSS, & continue to contribute to other OSS projects as part of my day job. I'm fortunate to be working in a culture that respects devoting working hours to OSS. That's not really a coincidence when I've been doing OSS on the side for years beforehand This isn't for everyone: I spend hours programming outside work, & I agree it's unfair to expect everyone to devote their off hours to programming.

          "text": "OSS is a side hustle for most people that work it. It might turn into a full time paid gig for some but that's usually based on merit or just being in the right place at the right time. Which of course is nice but not something you can plan on having. Additionally a lot of OSS software is created by people that are doing this as part of their job at some company that happens to have some interest in a project or creates new projects. Either work for one of those. Or just contribute without any expectations about money. That's not for everyone but it kind of is how a lot of OSS gets created. And mostly hiring for such projects is done on merit based on being an active contributor. If you have a community of contributors, that's a great pool to hire from. You already know the people and their capabilities. I have a few OSS projects on Github. Most of those are just things I'm interested in doing anyway. I don't mind giving that away. I use a lot of OSS as well in my non OSS development so I see this as just contributing back and being a good OSS citizen. My own little way of providing back. And it's a useful way to make new freelance projects or jobs a bit less Ground Hog day. If you keep on writing the same code over and over again; just put it out there with some OSS license and next time reuse what you've already written. I've done that between a few startups now (where I was CTO so I could just do that at my discretion). Nice to not have to start from zero. And there are secondary effects if you are active as a consultant or freelancer in the sense that having some projects that people actually use gives you a bit more credibility as a developer, as an expert, as somebody that knows what they are talking about. Minimum it's just a nice portfolio of stuff you can do. Maximum it actually helps generate a bit of business and inbound for your services. People don't pay for OSS software. But they do pay for support, consulting, etc. And you are the world's leading expert on your OSS software. I dabble on the side (next to my main job as a CTO) doing occasional consulting on Elasticsearch and related technologies. I maintain a Kotlin client for Elasticsearch/Opensearch which is getting some usage and contributions. Mostly that's just something I use myself; so I don't mind spending some time on it. Most of my customers are not necessarily into Kotlin; so they wouldn't be using my software necessarily. But it helps them understand that I know what I'm doing and talking about. And it gets me a bit of exposure. OSS is not a bad sales tactic to just put yourself out there. reply",

          "text": "As has already been said, by far the best way is to work for a company whose product is open source.  I would find one that is fully committed to open source though, not just partially.  By that I mean, a mainstream, money-making product of theirs is licensed appropriately (AGPL, MIT, etc).  Going with a company that open sources a few libraries here and there is not a good strategy. That said, I have friends that have been able to spin open source roots into money, in one case really good money.  Their paths were: 1.  Find need not being addressed 2.  Write open source solution for said need 3.  Promote open source solution to drive adoption (yes, marketing is important in open source!) 4.  Create training courses/material on solution 5.  Sell training primarily to corporations and sometimes individuals for $ The other path has the same first 3 steps, but instead of training: 4.  Establish a \"support\" department 5.  Sell support to corporations There's also the \"open core\" approach where you put enterprise features behind a pay-gate but give the basic product out as standard OSS.  The biggest challenge here is that your business strategy will ultimately be in conflict with your community member's interests, which inevitably results in sacrificing one for the other, usually sacrificing community needs for the business.  For example, consider you have SSO gated behind payment, and someone sends you a PR that adds SSO to your open core version.  I would personally avoid this model unless you enjoy inner philosophical conflict with guaranteed losers and having to exert tight control on other people. The support path requires your product to be a lot more mature than most people usually think as most corps will expect things like SSO, audit logs, and other enterprisey features.  You can usually find customers who won't insist on that, but any of the medium to large fish will. The donation model can be sustainable and even pretty good if you find the right niche, though expect to put in a lot of time/effort early on before you get many donations. Lastly you could try the free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer approach where your software is GPL but not free.  Davis Remmel has used this for rcu[1] for example (which if you have a Remarkable Tablet you should absolutely purchase rcu!).  Personally I love this model and am highly inclined to purchase when prices are reasonable, but it's not for everyone. Regardless, thank you for being interested in contributing to OSS!  I think most people are largely unaware of the importance and significance of open source in our current world.  It is one of the greatest gifts you can give, and enables people to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  Essentially everything we have nowadays is powered at least in part by open source. [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply",

          "text": "Juust putting this out there: 1. Some people made good money from shareware in the early home computer days. One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knopf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-File Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded \"ten times\" what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business. 2.

Yes, this is lazy ass, this is dangerous, but it is how people behave. I'd think something as dumb (for the user, but complex to make) as a GraphRAG system that already has a developer's code repo and design docs in the system, and is then able to be given \"candidate libraries\" which the GraphRAG+LLM reasoning agent then evaluates the candidate against the active project for compatibility. That would be one decent application, but the better one is once a \"candidate library\" is accepted, that GraphRAG+LLM agent can just-in-time explain to the developer how a library works and should integrate with their active code base than any documentation. reply",

I built it originally to gather the data to build a model which can predict if an article will get upvoted based on the headline,  later I wanted to use it to prevent my YOShInOn RSS reader and agent from posting duplicates.  I learned that the two things contradict because if you scan everything quickly everything has zero votes and zero comments! It used to use arangodb but the license for that sucks so I just tore it down to use postgres,  I developed an adaptation layer that makes postgres look like arangodb,  at least enough to port my applications.  I added the data structures so it can recrawl posts after two weeks so it can be fresh and have accurate counts.  I am talking with a friend about reranking comments so I am planning on using the bot to suck down comments for some big discussions and rerank them. reply",

The feeling that you aren't keeping up is the result of increased experience with the world as an adult combined with a mistaken belief held when your experiences consisted largely of childhood. On the bright side, once you accept how much you don't know and that you can't know everything, you realize that the rest of your life can be spent being amazed by the new things you learn. Or not. Or to put it another way, trying to keep up is a manifestation of FOMO. Good luck. reply",
