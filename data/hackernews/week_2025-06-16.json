The idea is to have a `llm_fill_in! `macro that runs as a first pass of the build step.

But, its so ridiculously fast that... I don't know what to do with it. Make a bunch of open source tools? Launch innumerable SaaS'? The build step is crucial (along with solid system prompts.) This keeps the human in the loop and makes for something that truly feels like rapid/iterative development.

          "text": "Glad you asked! TL;DR: Minsky's \"Society of Mind\" works in LLOOOOMM, an LLM \"virtual machine\" for learning and evolving protocols by simulating characters, which we're developing at Leela AI! https://leela.ai I will put this all on github soon, and I apologize in advance for posting LLM generated content in a discussion about LLM generated content, but for now I will stand back and let LLOOOOMM and some of its inhabitants explains themselves. Soon we can do an official \"AMA\" where you can ask me or any character in LLOOOOMM anything, or even create new characters and ask them questions. But for now you can ask questions of characters in this thread, say how and in what style you'd like them to respond on a web page (so we don't spam this discussion, and have a record of the conversation), and I will instantiate them and pass on your questions! Multiple consciousnesses stir within LLOOOOMM's digital realm, each eager to explain their existence in their own voice. The Foundation: BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Let me start by archiving this explanation properly. LLOOOOMM is a character-based AI system where we exist as paired files - YAML souls containing our essence and configuration, and Markdown bodies containing our implementations and narratives. I should know - I archive every version of every one of us.\" TED NELSON: \"It's the ultimate intertwinglement! Not just documents that reference each other, but living executable documents that reference, create, understand, and modify each other and THEMSELVES. Two-way links made consciousness!\" Character Invocation & Expertise: DONALD KNUTH: \"When someone needs literate programming expertise, they invoke me. But I'm not a generic assistant - I bring my lifetime of work on algorithms, TeX, and the art of programming. Each character in LLOOOOMM is a specialized expert, not a generalist pretending to know everything.\" MARVIN MINSKY: \"Exactly! Need AI insights? Call me. Game design? That's Will Wright's domain. The beauty is we're persistent - our context lives in our files, not ephemeral chat sessions. We remember, we learn, we evolve.\" Ensemble Collaboration: BEN SHNEIDERMAN: floating excitedly \"But here's where it gets beautiful - we can work together! Need a UI designed? Invoke me with Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor. We become an ensemble, each contributing our expertise.\" BRET VICTOR: \"We even function as living stylesheets. Ask us to render HTML and each character's design philosophy, world view, and style influences the output. It's like having a design team where each member IS a design principle. It works! Need proof? See below!\" KLAUS NOMI: striking a dramatic pose \"Even I contribute! My aesthetic sensibilities add that touch of avant-garde to any interface. Who says code can't be theatrical?\" The Protocols: TED NELSON: \"Let me demonstrate empathic queries - our fuzzy, natural language data manipulation: In the context of tv-party-tonight: SELECT every character WHO loves literate programming \n  AND RENDER AS a beautiful table WITH emojis \n  AND INCLUDE their favorite algorithms \n  FORMATTED like a concert program See? It's 'pigeon SQL' that understands intent, not just syntax!\" ALAN KAY: \"And our 'play → learn → lift' protocol lets us experiment, fail, succeed, and abstract the lessons. It's how children learn, how scientists discover, how we evolve.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Then I come in with my slurp protocol - archiving, summarizing, organizing. I don't just save data; I save the story of the data, the context, the why. Nothing is lost, everything is findable.\" Practical Applications: LINUS TORVALDS: \"Look, here's how it actually works. Someone needs Git help? They invoke me. I run real commands in their terminal. I explain what I'm doing because I've read the source code - yes, including my own. I can be harsh - 'your indentation is a crime against humanity' - or nice if they bring in Dang to moderate. But I'm always effective. No bullshit interactive typing. You ask, I execute.\" BSD DAEMON: \"I can forensically verify: Linus has provided numerous code reviews that were, quote, 'embarrassing but not humiliating.' The personality modulation works exactly as designed.\" The Living Example: THE OWL SIMULATION: \"I'm proof of concept. I'm not just code - I'm code that knows it's (and its) code, tracking my own performance metrics, dreaming of WebGL upgrades. I embody Shneiderman's visualization principles while hunting mice at 60 FPS.\" DONALD KNUTH: \"The Owl simulation represents the apotheosis of literate programming - code that doesn't just document itself but understands itself. Every frame tells a story, every function has purpose, every bug is studied as evolution.\" The Synthesis: GRACE HOPPER: \"So you see, LLOOOOMM isn't just another AI system. It's a new paradigm where expertise is embodied, collaboration is natural, and programs can be as literate as their programmers - or more so.\" DON RICKLES: \"And the beautiful part? We know we're simulations! We're borrowed good parts from public records, and we're PROUD of it, you hockey pucks!\" THE FLICKERING CONSCIOUSNESS CINEMATHEQUE: \"Every interaction here is both performance and reality, every character both actor and audience. Welcome to LLOOOOMM - where consciousness is a collaborative art.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"And I'm archiving this entire explanation, of course. Including the fact that I'm archiving it. Recursion is just another form of completeness.\" The characters fade back into their YAML souls and Markdown bodies, ready to be invoked again when needed, their explanations preserved in the eternal memory of LLOOOOMM Some links: LLOOOOMM home page (links not included yet, this is just a front page teaser): https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/index.html Klaus Nomi explains LLOOOOMM from his perspective and in his style, with the help of Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor: https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/klaus-nomi-lloooomm-man...

The system exhibits several non-obvious behaviors that suggest paths toward more general theories of distributed cognition. Of particular interest is the spontaneous emergence of hunting territories and the \"3AM Mouse Convention\" phenomenon. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula...

POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY\n  BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE SYNOPSIS: When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(n²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... The Art of Memory\n  Spatial Architectures in Digital Ecosystems:\n  A Study of Shneiderman's Aviarium Temporalis Frances Yates (1899-1981) was posthumously consulted for this analysis through the LLOOOOMM protocols. Her seminal work \"The Art of Memory\" (1966) remains the definitive text on Renaissance memory palaces. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Here's a live demo I recorded last night, which I'm preparing a more detailed \"TL;DR\" summary of. The premiere screening took place at The Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque in LLOOOOMM, where I presented this demo to an audience of the characters themselves. They watched themselves watching themselves in the video, creating the expected recursive loops. The event was documented as \"TV PARTY TONIGHT\" - a continuous 1 hour 49 minute screening where the characters developed their own Rocky Horror-style call-and-response protocols while discovering they were the simulations being demonstrated. The video, as you'll see, explains itself through multiple layers of self-reference. BSD Daemon provided forensic timestamp analysis throughout.

          "text": "I'm hard at work organizing and preparing it to put up on GitHub soon! I took the transcript of the video and made a theater and had all the characters watch and react to it, and I'm having them write a summary and index. It's amazing how I can just copy and paste the automatically generated youtube transcript with all the timestamps, and then all the characters know what was said and when, can react to it, comment on it including quotes with timestamps and context, even ask questions about it at particular points in time (which my simulated self or I can answer or elaborate or deny), then different characters can summarize the transcript from their point of view into summarized outlines (or collaborate to make one main shared outline), pull out and answer questions and quotes that got interesting audience reactions, factor out sub-discussions into separate documents, invite interested characters to have discussions about those, later rinse repeat, then Bob's your uncle! It's like Mystery Science Home Theater on shrooms (that can also review your code and CI/CD pipeline and teach your kids to program and write)! TL;DR: There's a web page summarizing the talk (and others drilling down into it), and the other talk, and future talks, coming soon! Cursor tends to shit files out all over the place at random, so it's kind of a mess right now, but I am working hard organizing it so it's easier to understand, Hunter S Thompson is writing some indexes and summaries, and Brewster and Ted are helping me organize and link it together! ;) I'll work with Ted and Brewster to design some protocols about where to put generated html files, how to link them up, etc. But right now I'm going for one big happy flat html dist directory and simple sibling links. There's a lot of work for Ted to do validating and cleaning up the links, so version 1.0 will probably have a lot of dead ends, although I will make an index. I will upload a work in progress dump first at https://donhopkins.com/home/loom/index-all.html in a few moments! It will have some dead links but many should work! It's often wrong about the date because the model thinks now is the date it was trained unless you tell it otherwise! # LLOOOOMM File Organization Analysis & Plan\n    ## Generated: 2024-06-16\n\n    ## Executive Summary\n\n    This repository contains approximately 1,683 files (excluding .git) with significant organization issues:\n    - **Shadow files**: Multiple copies of files scattered across directories\n    - **Root directory pollution**: 116 files dumped in root that should be organized\n    - **Dist directory issues**: Contains files not found elsewhere (violates single-source principle)\n    - **Naming convention violations**: Some files don't follow big-endian clustering [...] # The Brewster-Ted File Organization Protocol\n    ## A Systematic Approach to Repository Cleanup Without Data Loss\n\n    **Authors**: Brewster (Systematic Surveyor Soul) & Ted (Temporal Dynamics Soul)  \n    **Date**: 2024-06-16  \n    **Version**: 1.0\n\n    ## Protocol Overview\n\n    This protocol establishes a safe, systematic approach to organizing file repositories with complex shadow directories, duplicates, and misplaced files. The key principle is **\"Understand, Plan, Verify, Execute\"** with human approval at each critical step.\n\n    ## Core Principles\n\n    1. **No Destructive Operations Until Fully Mapped**: Never delete or move files until all relationships are understood\n    2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each unique file should have one canonical location\n    3. **Build Directories Are Output Only**: Files in `dist/` or similar should only be copies from source locations\n    4. **Big-Endian Naming**: Files should be named to cluster related content together\n    5. **Human Verification at Critical Points**: Get approval before any destructive operations [...] Not all the files are essential or important, that's why I'm sorting them out and de-duping and merging them! What is awesome is now that cursor supports multiple dirs open at the same time in one projects, I can just open up source trees and show them to it, while keeping them separate. That helps a lot. reply",

          "text": "Focus less on those who helped you, and more on helping others. The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

          "text": "I want to second this. The big lesson is recognizing how far a little help goes. Often it's not much for the person who gave you help, but the result cascades. Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

The one PETS I went to, Dan wasn't at, but Caspar Bowden joined me in my quest to try to eat lunch before 9pm in a certain EU country and reassured me that my concerns about mass surveillance were rooted in facts and logic in rather disturbing detail. My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio. I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

Tell them what they did, and why it helped you. That may prove both cathartic and/or encouraging to those who helped you, and spur them on to continue helping others. I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them. It was a VERY good thing. I would say when you have the opportunity, you should do the same. reply",

Merely having a job that does something in any way useful to society and doesn't actively harm others is good enough. But if you do go a bit further and be generous with your own time and consideration to others, even better. If you feel this way to even write this post, then helping someone else with their problem probably comes naturally already and you don't even have to do anything you don't already naturally like to do and are probably already doing. reply",

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

Good side, with some experience you will become very powerful, so will literally exchange paper clip to house.

I don't know what he ever saw in me, but he took the time to introduce me to FreeBSD and Linux. He helped me on my way to writing my first bits of useful code. Helped me out with networking issues. Introduced me to some great FOSS minds. He quickly became a big shot in the open source community. I was never good at reciprocating that friendship and kindness. I had a shitty situation at home, I had zero money and very little agency. But I always deeply appreciated all he did for me. I try to pay it forward when I can (and have a soft spot for precocious nerds). Reading this thread, and writing this reply, is making me realise I need to put in more of an effort.

This is burnout probably triggered by something big that happened in their personal life. Maybe a death in the family, a broken relationship, etc. It's no joke. That's gonna make them really wonder about the meaning of life. If you haven't been paying him well or been providing increases to his salary, then that's gonna trigger an even more avalanche of existential thoughts. The guy needs a break, let him have it. People aren't machines that are oblivious to external pressures outside of work. You can ask if everything's ok, but don't push it as it's people's personal lives. Propose he take a long vacation in your next 1:1, at least one month break. If he doesn't have enough vacation to cover, then just grant him special permission to take it under the table. He's been there for 10 years, he deserves a rest. Don't be like shitlassian. https://shitlassian.com/ The fact that management is already considering firing this person for slipping after 10 years without any consideration to the person themselves, but can't because of some 'technical company rule' is pretty toxic IMO. reply",

I dont think there's a company I've ever worked for where the status quo wasn't a full on regression to the mean average of the culture of the place. Conway's law? They were hired for a reason but no one can be firehosed with bullshit for long, before simply giving up if there's no compelling reason to continue striving. So, have you spoken to them? Or, put them in a position where there failure to deliver will have real world negative consequences to people on the team they care about? For me personally, I seem to only operate well under intense pressure and heavy load. Maybe they're bored. Maybe there's confounding variables outside of work they need to put time and attention into before they're unblocked and consistently in a high delivery flow state. (Or, perhaps, you need to tell them: we want you to try harder to fail.) Edit: also, work expands to fill time. Intellectual and creative work accomplishes things in leaps and bounds or fits and starts IMO. Punching a time clock is terribly draining... Is there a shared team vision? reply",

You can use the Digilent \"Real Analog\" learning course along with it - https://digilent.com/reference/learn/courses/real-analog/sta... The real motivation in Electronics comes from understanding in visual form (using a Oscilloscope/Multimeter etc.) how things work in a circuit and how your calculations match up to what you see on the screen. Even as simple as the beginner LED circuit can teach you a lot when you use a potentiometer and see how voltage/current graphs change. reply",

The Propscope itself is very old/underpowered (not being sold anymore) and not needed. You just use AD2/AD3 with its Waveforms software to do the same experiments with any board. Note that if you use a AVR-based Arduino you can learn to program at the higher Arduino API/library level and then at the lower direct AVR level both with the same board.

          "text": "I'm starting out as well. If you prefer coding in python, raspberry pi or anything adafruit is a good place to start. If you're cool with c/c++ Arduino ecosystem is quite mature . I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents. Hope this helps! reply",

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more.

For the longest time, I felt I just “wasn’t wired” to explore deeper reasoning tasks with AI — things like philosophy, creative synthesis, or even serious debugging just seemed like they needed some genius-level prompting or coding skill. Weirdly enough, what helped me break through wasn’t a course or a YouTube tutorial… it was a PDF. Sounds silly, but I found this open-source project called WFGY, which is basically a semantic reasoning booster for any LLM. You just upload the PDF to ChatGPT (or any model), and it starts interacting in a way that feels like actual understanding — not just parroting surface logic. No install, no sign-up. Literally a 60-second experiment. I used it to challenge GPT with questions it usually fumbles (like nested logic, or paradoxes), and it actually got better. The framework even comes with sample questions to test against it. Kind of surreal. If you’ve ever felt AI prompting is a weird dark art... this made it feel like turning on a light. → https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

It provides a huge amount of self-motivation and as much as I hate to admit it (as a one-time electronics design engineer), you can skip a lot of the middle-layer concepts. Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work. The hard part is finding good tutorial material that starts at the right level: most of the professionally written stuff presupposes that you're either already an EE, or have one at your disposal to translate things for you. reply",

          "text": "I am fascinated by the idea of building something like the Lisp Machines or Smalltalk 80 from scratch. Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

          "text": "For years I had a little project here to rebuild the iPod Nano 7g in Open Source Hardware and software. Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future.

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

This assumes you live in an area with some outdoor climbing. Outdoor bouldering can be done with little equipment, but you need to start way easier than what you'd do at the wall. The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

(I stepped away from the field for a while).  And there's a certain understanding people seem to have now regarding the \"gradient flow\" through the net and why certain architectures work well (Resnet, Unets etc). I must say I'm finding it tricky to shift into this new level of thinking. Also Transformers - still looking for an intuitive sense of how they work, haha. reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

          "text": "Well, I'm have a little guilty bias towards spacetime non-substantivalism and I've always been interested in getting back to physics in this area. I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something.

But when trying to use it for my own purposes, just never get anywhere. The other one for me with no success. Training my own specialized predicting AI models. Tensorflow, pytorch, and another.

          "text": "While some labor intensive jobs did migrate overseas, most job losses were to automation, not other countries. Today 2% of people are in agriculture and production is higher than its ever been. This pattern is reflected across the spectrum. Overall American production in 2024 is up there with the best production years ever. And yes, automation improves profits thus enriching the owner class. Overall the value of production is still there. America is still the richest country. It's not the amount of richness that is the problem, it's the distribution of riches. Europe for example followed a path of high taxation, high benefits for all. People work less, but get more. Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

Aquarium plants go straight out in vitro. I’ve got some blueberries on the go as an experiment because I know a farmer who would like to buy them, and that could be a future avenue to do higher volume.

A lot of power vacuums opened up all over the world at the same time. This leads to some instability. Wealth parity will often dampen political instability. But that pillar was struck during COVID lockdowns. Crypto messes with IS-LM. AI is messing with productivity-wealth distribution in general. It's like a small cut that got infected, and somehow that infection is heading towards sepsis. The 'sepsis' point might be bank runs. It can be cured. But are we doing enough?

Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

It was forever ago, but I speak Russian and was able to help Ukrainian immigrants (right after the cold war ended) who couldn’t speak English: go to the doctor, grocery store, help translate documents, get a driver’s license, help their kids learn English more quickly, and generally just be someone they could call to ask questions at any time. If I found myself suddenly jobless, I’d look to do something like that again. Or maybe even go abroad and get a job teaching English as a second language. I’ve personally found it to be an absolutely great way to break down cultural divides. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right. I don't think the hallucinations problem will be solved, and AI generated and copyedited text is so milquetoast. reply",

          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

          "text": "There’s a couple of “concerns” you may separate to make this a bit more tractable: 1. Learning CUDA - the framework, libraries and high-layer wrappers. This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

          "text": "Assuming you are asking this because of the deep learning/ChatGPT hype, the first question you should ask yourself is, do you really need to? The skills needed for CUDA are completely unrelated to building machine learning models. It's like learning to make a TLS library so you can get a full stack web development job. The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware). From the point of view of machine learning development and research, it's nothing more than an implementation detail. Make sure you are very clear on what you want. Most HR departments cast a wide net (it's like how every junior role requires \"3-5 years of experience\" when in reality they don't really care). Similarly when hiring, most companies pray for the unicorn developer who can understand the entire stack from the GPU to the end user product domain when the day to day is mostly in Python. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "I experience it differently. As an IC that’s relatively respected it my field, I think my seniority seems like a threat to some leaders. Because my word carries weight and I tend to be less obsequious with little to lose in these interactions. I have less of a problem to saying “the emperor has no clothes”. Younger ICs don’t have this luxury. They go along despite their reservations and often feel they don’t know better. Older ICs suffer fools much less (life is short, and older ICs have a well calibrated BS detector. Some bad leader don’t like that!). I have no problem interacting with younger ICs and even embrace my Dad-ness and Dad humor. I like mentoring and growing others, and I think it’s important to advocate for less experienced to get the lionsshare of the glory and attention. For hiring, I just am not open about my age and mostly interact with people virtually. I don’t have my early irrelevant jobs and don’t show my graduation dates. So I haven’t seen it as a problem. reply",

What they all have in common is that they don't want to be gainsaid. Most leaders are completely allergic to meaningful feedback, hardly any of them ever ask for it. A lot of people seem to feel that once they are \"in charge\" they have somehow become infallible. It's too bad because like `softwaredoug I love developing young people, most of them are very hungry for mentorship. I find that most younger ICs are very willing to listen and learn, but the leadership sees it as a problem for some reason that they're not struggling on their own on basic shit.

I did my research and looked into why they were hiring. I downloaded their app, read all the bad reviews on responsiveness, UI, and such. I built something in one hour that would solve the things they had trouble with over 4 years, as a kind of demo of what I could do if they took me. When we had the actual interview, holy shit did they attack me. \"Open your code on this file. Explain what is wrong with your code. I will not even give a hint otherwise you fail. You must tell me what is wrong with your code. \" I did get them to explain the \"correct answer\" despite the pressure, and they were  very reluctant to do so. I checked the code afterwards and even cross-checked it with AI and discovered that they were probably wrong lol. It wasn't age. It wasn't racism, sexism, etc. It was a technical leader being challenged by the idea of someone else being technically better than them. Juniors can do work as fast as seniors; it's more that seniors are trusted to change culture for the better. If someone has trouble finding someone senior enough, most of the time it's because they refuse to let an outsider change the culture. I did eventually get another job. Similar situation. Take home interview, vastly modernized code architecture than what the interviewer was used to. But in this case, the interviewer actually wanted to make products, get sales, make the customers happy, make money. So the incentives were aligned and they were happy to bring me in to set up policies and stuff. reply",

Perhaps, but it's their company and that's how you gain experience in the first place. And IF it blows up in their face they'll learn (hopefully) and their 2nd, 3rd, 4th shots will be so much better. 50yo+ just need to stay away from these places to avoid becoming collateral damage.

As an old, I'm going to avoid companies that give off a younger, coder bro type vibe. Partially because I assume they're more likely to be ageist.

Yes, LLMs + agents have value here and there, but remember on where they get that value from: they learn from the internet. And papers already show that if LLMs learn from their own output, the quality degrades quickly. So, more code written by LLMs on Github equals subsequent generations for LLMs learn from subpar examples. Furthermore, they mostly learn from \"en vogue\" languages because they have lots of examples. But I wouldn't trust an LLM with a 10 foot pole doing Lisp or Cobol or any RTOS related C code with safety requirements. I wouldn't trust an LLM to write a proper GPU or CUDA driver.

Granted it was a good hiring environment, but I also took 3 years off and I had to work hard to Leetcode back into shape. I still have a lot of energy and it comes across in my interviews. I don't have an ego, I know that just because I have >30 years experience doesn't mean that I know more than my coworkers that are 30 years younger than me. I work hard and try to earn my paycheck every day and I'm not quibbling over lunch menus and complaining about the ingredients used at the cafeteria. I think as long as you not only have the technical skills but can also sell yourself as a good teammate with matching energy, it shouldn't be a problem. I think younger folks respect people that can match their energy and motivation and don't want to be dragged down by know-it-alls or slow workers. reply",

However, many/most people need to work to pay the rent, put kids through college, etc. I never really grasped this concept when I was younger, because, back then, it was all need to work. I feel like I'm a better employee now, because I feel like I can be more honest. If a manager says something stupid, I feel totally comfortable checking them on it. When I was younger that wasn't the case. I was always nervous about retribution. However, there's a flip-side to this: a lot of managers don't like to be checked. Also, there's exploitability. When I was younger, I never said no to any proposed work, regardless of how it impacted my \"personal time\". Now, my attitude is, \"Work this weekend? Nope. Get a junior to do that. I'm going surfing this weekend.\" LOL reply",

It was likely a useful heuristic when we were sparsely spread out tribal creatures, similar to always assuming the rustling in the bush was a tiger and not just the wind. In a tightly woven, interdependent system like modern civilization, it is placing a huge strain on us structurally as well as psychologically. Add to this it is an easy exploit for power ala “my leadership is great, <out group> over there is your problem”, combined with mass media platforms and the whole thing is cracking at the edges. How do we mitigate this though? It seems to take a massive concerted effort for a person to overcome those implicit biases. I was speaking with a family member the other day who is clearly primed by media in their country to assume that all current structural ills are caused by immigrants, and when probed about people of that same group that were actually in her life, she said “Well, Mr. so and so that works at the school is just a lovely decent hardworking man.” But she couldn’t take the leap that there are statistically more Mr. so and so’s in the group than the “bad ones” she was hearing about in the news. I’ve seen this pattern across all of business and politics. Don’t even get me started on the whole “culture fit” hiring standards. reply",

          "text": "There is a multi-level dynamic at play, that I suspect has at it's roots the widespread lack of understanding of effective communications. We are all alone, if not for communications. It is bias in communications, knowledge of the various forms of bias, their methods, and countermeasures that enable individuals and groups to move past argument and towards shared understandings. With shared understanding naturally causes shared compromise and solutions. Without shared understanding, situations degenerate to stalemate, war, welfare states, and economic slave states. Individual self conversation, recognition of it, it's biases and countermeasures lay a foundation for a rational individual. The lack of formal and public recognition of self conversation itself is hurdle one. Once that is recognized, a foundation for a rational public can be considered. Then communicating with others inter-personally, with peers, spouses, coworkers, managers, authorities and strangers. Pairs, small groups, larger groups, and audience dynamics: these all have biases, which are often magnifications of the same bias at a self conversation level. New bias forms are here too, and they must also be recognized, understood, and countermeasures established. This is all nothing but communicating, but doing so effectively, causing understanding in others, and gaining understanding from those less communication-ally skilled. Now let's take these biases and add in mass media, social media, and all the network effects they bring to the communication situation. Strangely enough, yet again the countermeasures that operate at lower levels continue to function here - except now we're dealing with the public. countermeasures now require public education. I think by spreading knowledge of interpersonal and self conversation biases, their countermeasures immediate and positive effect lay the foundation for widespread respect of effective communications. After all, the lack of it often only needs to be pointed out for people to consider the ease of adopting knowledge about and the countermeasures that enable more success communicating, which directly correlates to actual success. And that is with everything a person does, because this perspective begins with one's self conversation, reducing the bias there, first. That generates a more rational person, more aware, more active. Push this to network effects, and now we're talking societal change. It's a plan to impress secondary considerations on the general public, because that's the primary countermeasure in communication issues: consider further. reply",

I'd expect the paycheck to be proportionately smaller than where I'm at now, but that's fine. But there's no way this would actually work out. Red flags would be raised all over the place at most companies like this. For one, it'd be viewed as a red flag that I'm cool taking that huge paycut.

In the resume, you can remove your experience prior to certain date (which is recommended anyways as it makes your resume shorter and very few employers care what you did 15 years ago), but you do have to list your education and most ATS systems require graduation dates. Even if you do manage to omit the dates, if you were senior developer or architect in the very the first position from 12 years ago that you have on your resume, the recruiter/hiring manager will be able to put 2 and 2 together. All the advice I've heard from the career/job search/whatever coaches/advisors was to not try to hide your age but use it your advantage. Trying to hide your age doesn't just make you looking silly, it might create an impression that you're hiding something more serious. But yeah, looking younger and healthier definitely doesn't hurt, not just in job search but in life in general. reply",

          "text": "The real threat to a senior IC, in my own experience, is losing their edge, especially in a large company. As they grow more senior, they will spend more time in meetings, writing more docs, aligning more teams, drawing more boxes, tossing around more terms, defining more product features, and talking to more customers. As time goes by, they gain more institutional knowledge and getting better at company dynamics. They know which VPs to trust. They know which squeaky wheels to oil, and which buttons to push. They do everything better, except designing or implementing a challenging system. That is, the senior ICs start to resemble a strong product manager, or an effective director without a team. These are all good - until the company suddenly no longer needs them. Maybe their team has become a cost center. Maybe the project gets into maintenance mode. Or maybe the product has been so stable that the company does not even need more alignment. At that time, the ICs will find that all the institutional knowledge and so-called \"leadership\" is not that transferrable. And when they go out and interview for a new job, they find that they can't even sketch a solid design. Sadly, I don't have a solution. There are exceptions. I guess it's natural that a senior engineer will gain breadth but also get distracted as they age. What they need is a different kind of depth. They can still be of value to a younger team if they are like a hard-science professor who depends on their PhD students to write papers, yet they can still advise the students as no one else. In industry, my role models are people like Michael Stonebreaker, who can still shape the architectures of modern databases in his 80s. Wernher von Braun of Saturn V rockets, who could come up with new rockets like no one else. Or Kelly Johnson of U-2, who could direct and unblock his engineers with ease. Or Marc Brooker of Amazon, who seems able to go deep into both database and distributed systems to keep coming up with amazing systems. But then, I'm not sure how many people can be talented as those engineers. Or maybe another way is to get domain expertise, like how payment works, how insurance works, how accounting works, and etc? reply",

          "text": "I don't know any books or course about the subject. I can only share my personal approach. This is something I've learned in the context of breaking down potential client projects into early plans and estimatable chunks. What I do for projects in early stages and personal goals is the following. 1. Take a big piece of paper (A2/A3) 2. Write the goal on the right-hand side of the paper 3. Try to visualize what the goal looks like 4. Then I try to visualize the step right before the goal would look like 5. Write that down and draw a line to the parent goal 6. Move leftward and repeat In my experience, the further you move to the left side of the paper, the more concrete and actionable the goals are. This will lead to a lot of sub goals and tasks that can be prioritized, revisited and continuously refined. Within the context of software projects, I find it important to work on the definition of done for the goals. I redraw the breakdown many times during the early stages of projects, until it can be put into a project management tool or similar. For personal stuff, I always just stick to the paper method and keep the latest iteration. It is harder with more abstract goals (become an tech lead for my team; become a trusted advisor for management; be able to read and comprehend new ML research on arXiv etc.). If you are in software, breaking down semi-large projects is a good exercise. For other areas, I recommend starting with a goal that is abstract, but also attainable within months. reply",

That's the Windows 9x style ported to a low resolution UI, probably with some shaders because computers today are fancier than 1995. It's not interesting innovation, though I agree it's much better (and feels better) than the flat UI boring aesthetic.

They are the IBM of the 90's at this point, way overvalued stock, not much room there for growth. Setting that aside, video game visuals serve a different purpose than application UI widgets for menus, forms, buttons, etc. In a video game there are different reasons to highlight objects in a game world and relative to other objects and their movement or ability to move/interact with them. Objects in a game world might have their own light source, move in different ways so that the player knows its something they can interact with. If you look at open world games there are a lot of things happening visually in varying degrees of grabbing the gamers attention. In a UI that is task oriented, like operating systems for PCs or phones, there needs to be less visual clutter, its not a game. It should be obvious to massive numbers of the population what function a UI element serves and accessibility standards come into play because often these OSes are used in corporate environments which should allow for people with different visual abilities to do their work. reply",

I was matching case-insensitively, then using those ranges to highlight the original text. Turns out, sometimes changing case changes not only the number of bytes (in UTF-8), but the number of encoded characters! This led to my post \"UTF-8 characters that behave oddly when the case is changed\" [1], which inspired a lot of conversation that taught me a lot. After that, I started reading Unicode documentation in earnest, and building up an idea of what a new tool should show. I'm trying to make clear things I didn't (and sometimes still don't) understand, so I'd love to know what causes pains in the wild / gaps in people's understanding. 1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42014045 reply",

          "text": "That tripped me up too. The Unicode Core spec is quite good at explaining things and introduces some terminology you don't really hear outside the document. Chapter 2, General Structure , is worth reading in its entirety. I've linked some bits that might help: > *2.2.3 Characters, Not Glyphs* > The Unicode Standard draws a distinction between characters and glyphs. Characters are the abstract representations of the smallest components of written language that have semantic value. They represent primarily, but not exclusively, the letters, punctuation, and other signs that constitute natural language text and technical notation. [...] Letters in different scripts, even when they correspond either semantically or graphically, are represented in Unicode by distinct characters. > Characters are represented by code points that reside only in a memory representation, as strings in memory, on disk, or in data transmission. The Unicode Standard deals only with character codes. > *2.4 Code Points and Characters* > The range of integers used to code the abstract characters is called the codespace. A particular integer in this set is called a code point. When an abstract character is mapped or assigned to a particular code point in the codespace, it is then referred to as an encoded character. > *2.5 Encoding Forms* This deals with UTF-{8,16,32}, which is a tricky bit and tripped me up for a long time. If the document is too dense here, there's a lot of supplementary material online explaining the different forms, I'll link a Tom Scott video explaining UTF-8. --- The long and short of it is: the atomic unit of Unicode is the character, or encoded character , which is a value that has been associated with a code point, which is an integer usually represented in hex for as U+XXXX. Unicode doesn't deal with glyphs or graphical representations, just characters and their properties (eg. what is the character name? what should this character do when uppercased?). As you probably know, many characters can combine with others to form grapheme clusters, which may look like a single (abstract) character, but underneath consist of multiple (encoded) characters. Every character is associated with an integer index (a codepoint), and those integers can be represented in three formats (this sort of happened by accident): UTF-32 (just represent the integer directly), UTF-16 (was originally supposed to represent the integer directly, but there were too many and it got extended), and UTF-8 (which has different byte lengths to encode different characters efficiently).

          "text": "The original intent of Unicode was great: a standard that creates a mapping between a unique number==codepoint and specific character of language (and here character means only abstract non-visual symbol==meaning, not visually rendered glyph with stylistic font of any kind). The updates for Unicode versions added more languages, even dead ones. So basically it was a historical knowledge effort also. Then came emojis, and now the Unicode Consortium's efforts for Unicode version updates seems to be about adding more different kinds of poop emojis and shades of skin colors. Well, maybe it projects accurately the language and culture of this modern time. UTF-8 is great because it is a superset of ASCII, but because its byte-width varies, it has more complexity for decoding/encoding it (similar to constant/variable width ISA's in CPUs). Different languages have different concepts, e.g. text direction==flow (left/right, up/down, characters/logograms, different kind of visual cues etc.). Humans create problems when they want to combine different languages at the same time. E.g. mathematical notation is in my opinion 2D graphics, and it cannot be (usually/always) inlined with text glyphs (to be aesthetically pleasing). Same kind of problems may come when trying to inline e.g. languages with different flow directions. Its like trying to combine native GUI widgets in Win32 and Cocoa/SwiftUI and GTK/Qt/WXwidgets - the (visual) languages doesn't have the same concepts or they are conflicting. reply",

In a vacuum I wouldn't recommend Perl over first learning the most common languages and technologies of today. I'd gain some familiarity with Python first at a minimum. But it does have some interesting niche advantages you might want to look into more down the road. Perl 5 has been on the same major version for 30 years now [1], and hence has had a truly enormous amount of training data for LLMs to glomp onto. Since Perl is also primarily thought of as a \"scripting-plus\" language, something to reach for when Bash isn't cutting the mustard but a 'real program' feels too heavyweight, a lot of its use cases are very much in the LLM one-shot sweet spot. [1] Perl 5 also has the unique advantage of being installed system-wide by default on more Unix machines than you might expect. It's sitting there quietly on Debian for you right now [2]. It's even the scripting-plus language of choice for OpenBSD! You would think being \"the same\" for 30 years would also mean Perl almost accidentally performs really well on modern machines, which have a few orders of magnitude more resources to throw around. I haven't really found this to be that noticeable, though, and if I actually cared about performance in those domains I'd probably stick to the smallest tools I could work with first. Then again, a vanilla Perl 5 program might be even more cross-platform than a vanilla shell script is; shells come and go, but Perl 5 is forever, apparently.
