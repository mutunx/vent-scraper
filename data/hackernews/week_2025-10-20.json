          "text": "I created a website and mobile app to display all the coffee shops in the state of Minnesota. It's a .Net Core MVC website and React Native mobile app that is pretty much entirely vibe coded. I've had fun with building the data loaded, website and mobile app via Claude Code from VS Code. However, I didn't find building the project as enjoyable as actual coding myself. The code is a mess and is definitely overengineered and hard to read. I have had to consistently fix bugs and calibrate my prompts so the machine could produced the features that I was trying to create. Another thing I learned is to commit early and often. Then create PRs to check what code was updated as things got away from me quickly without me knowing or asking the machine to do the thing it did. A few times entire sections of code were removed that had nothing to do with the feature I was working on. Being able to go back to the previous working commit probably saved me hours. Vibe coding an entire project was a good experience. There's a lot to learn and focus on the next time I go this route. Take a look! https://mplscoffee.com reply",

          "text": "I've created Livi! It is an internal tool for me and my team so we can encode complex images that sometimes have plenty of detail and transparency into optimized AVIF files for our websites. https://github.com/MARTYR-X-LTD/livi Backend is Rust and Frontend is SwiftUI. At some point I'll make a Libadwaita frontend for a Linux release. Given my knowledge in Swift and Rust is pretty limited, it was an interesting project to learn the strenghts and limits of LLMs. I've learned quite a lot with it. Most useful lesson is that you might not necessarily need to know the specifics of a language, but you do have to have your common sense skills sound and clear, and how to code architecture a larger project, with refactors here and there, performance optimizations, multithreading, queue, cache and logs, and so on. Maybe needless to say, but it wasn't easy. The produced code needed to be inspected constantly, and bugfixing, testing, handling edge cases required tons of prompting and guidance. The comparison features, such as pinch to zoom, keep the zoom and image positions while switching between the different generated images, handling exporting, all these features were loaded with intricacies. So far, glad that I was able to produce this. As a fun fact, now that AVIFENC supports tune=iq, we don't have to mess with specific encoder settings and find the proper quality number anymore, but still, learned a lot from it reply",

For example, on court cases, I want to know what ends up happening, how those SC or Fed court rulings actually impact businesses, etc.<p>Anyone know any news organizations tracking that type of stuff so that interested peeps can keep getting updates?<p>And finally, are there any news websites that are screening out day to day stuff and just posting monthly status on what is going on to help put the trend in context?<p>Everything just seems like 100 voices in a room screaming for attention and no context or decision on what is really important or fascinating...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I subscribe to The Economist which I think curates things at the weekly period well. I have roughly 5 blogs I check every day. I rely on my YOShInOn RSS reader for news on a wide range of topics,  with the caveat that it isn't particular fast.  For news about science and technology it doesn't matter if it is delayed two weeks,  but it is a problem for sports where you don't run to look at an article about what happened in week 6 of the NFL after week 7 goes down. I am lucky that Ithaca has several weekly papers,  both print and web-based,  that make up for the fact that our \"paper of record\" is a zombie.  It used to be when a local election happened I would buy an Ithaca Journal the next day to see the results,  but now the head office updates that paper around 3pm in the afternoon the next day .  Our board of elections usually posts the results around 8pm the night of the election and all the 'alternative' papers run articles on it right away -- the Ithaca Journal used to send reporters to public meetings but no more,  no wonder there is a movement to defund it by taking public notices out of it. reply",

So I must be missing something—why is this possible?<p>Imagine if the government required car license plates, but instead of issuing them itself or through its affiliates, there was a parasitic middleman that the government required you to buy from. I know ICANN is somewhat similar, but ICANN is effectively a child of a U.S. defense agency, so it makes sense—and you can buy domains from multiple companies.<p>Why isn’t ISBN funded and run by a government agency, like the U.S. Trademark Office?</p></p></div>",

HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV. But you're also insane expecting a small reseller of some small company to pull your chestnuts out of the fire. reply",

          "text": "I work for an MSP, mostly with small to medium companies. Licensing costs went up a ton when broadcom acquired vmware. They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

I strongly recommend using the terraform provider to help manage at scale.  The docs seem  a little sparse for beginners, but if you already know kubernetes concepts, it's pretty easy to pick up.  If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize. They have to explain to the board why their spending increased and they are still on legacy. - [1] - https://www.talos.dev/ reply",

          "text": "Hi, im a presales engineer for OVHcloud, a cloud provider. OVH is a \"pinacle\" VMware partner, we are a huge reseller of VMware licenses, and were able to secure a 3-5 years contract with broadcom with only 5 to 15% of price increase. Of course, the clients I talk with are mostly interested in moving to the cloud or are already in the cloud, so it won't be applicable to you if you'd stay on-prem. I wanted to share my experience. For some clients, change of  technology would be more expensive than paying a bit more to VMware. You'd have to re-train half your IT department, and the migration could be long, risky and complexe. So in this case, a lift and shift move-to-cloud can be competitive, and frankly a serious option. I see a lot of projects with Nutanix, but you'd be surprise of the price, which is almost the same as VMware. Nutanix comes with way more features than vanilla vsphere which explains the cost increase. You'd have NSX and vSAN packaged, plus replication features. Nutanix offers a great alternative. Actually, OVH proposes Nutanix too, so we can be agnostic and have a sort of leverage over Broadcom. Some clients are ok to move to public cloud (equivalent AWS/Azure..). The smaller the infra the easier it is. It can be very cheap at OVH. Also it's great if you do containers because of the universal nature of them, they are easy to migrate.\nHowever, If the client has a lot of Windows Server, the cost is actually higher (at OVH the price of the Windows Server Licence is higher than at Azure..) because we cannot leverage the Windows Datacenter licenses The cheapest viable option is to go to Proxmox on Baremetal servers. The features are close to a standard vSphere environnement. The lack of enterprise support is the thing that stops most clients to do this move. reply",

          "text": "All good points, except perhaps the cost of the move. With VMWare licences anecdotallty increasing ~8x, the cost of moving could well be recovered quite quickly. Organisations tend to think and react strategically, and this will mean 3-5 year (or more) financial projections for major projects. If a $1m VMWare annual bill is now $8m, over 5 years thats $5m vs $40m. A change to a $1m annually cluster isn't going to cost you $35m, so you should definitely look at changing to minimise your expenses, assuming you get the support etc that you need elsewhere. reply",

A few years after graduating, I pursued a teaching degree because it came with a great tax-free incentive. Now I’ve realised I want to use my original degree and get back into tech.<p>After my degree I didn't want to pursue it as I fell out of love with it, possibly due to stress and letting uni life get the better of me. It became stressful environment but through recent experiences and talking with close friends who are in the field of CS, overtime I've realised and processed that I still have a massive interest and constant want to learn more within it or somewhat be involved in it. The years of teaching it has definitely played a part in showing students my passion for the subject, reminding myself how much I love it too.<p>I've started picking up on python again and taking online courses to refresh myself but I want to make myself employable after these years. I have previous experience in java, php and C+ also. I've never worked in a professional coding environment either, hence why I am coming on here to seek advice on what would be best.<p>Any recommendations/advice would really help. What stacks I should be looking at?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

Discord's telemetry was broken on my browser, and on failure they immediately retried. It didn't take many actions queued up on the site before my browser was initiating over 100RPS, on their behalf. 2. Target and eBay still flag my sessions as bot traffic (presumably because they don't recognize the user agent or because I use Linux or something). Target allows browsing their site for a few items before heavily rate-limiting me for a day or so, and eBay just resets my password a day or two after I log in, every single bloody time. The problem is that from time to time normal users will generate large traffic volumes, and if the bot owner uses many IPs then you're forced to use less reliable signals for that ban hammer (i.e., no single user will be near 700 RPS). reply",

Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had a mind-blown-moment when I learnt that Obsidian was built without any frontend JS framework. ( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

That is a significant difference. Please stop repeating the 5 year number. It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver. Honestly, add some event signaling and XHR and you're further along to a smooth SPA-like experience than you might think. reply",

A guy asked a question about vanilla JavaScript, a completely valid question on a site about comments upon programming links, and yet notice all the comments that are instead not about that. There are so many comments about writing React, which is not what this thread is about.  There are so many comments from people talking about themselves instead of actually about programming, much less anything about vanilla JavaScript.  There are also comments like yours that are instantly hostility towards anything about original code, a subject that you seem to find horrifying. Yes, this is incredibly autistic.  Some common traits of autism, among many more that each autistic person may or may not have: * low social intelligence, which in this context displays when developers are only thinking about themselves, what's easiest for them, and cannot think about anything else such as users or business owners * fragile ego, which in this context results in hostility at subjects that expose a developers shallow capabilities and results in false displays of high confidence to mask deeply felt insecurity I got tired of working with immature people who, in a technical capacity, could only do a little more that copy/paste template code and were otherwise generally hostile because of high insecurity.  I am now in a different line of work where I don't have babysit people. Writing original code or writing applications without a giant framework isn't challenging, but the subject certainly feels like the world is caving in for a great many people who call themselves seniors or engineers. reply",

Any complicated web app will always hit some kind of corner case where you need to bypass your framework and manipulate an element. For example, the spinner that you see on https://manage.onopti.com/ is disabled with a pure DOM call once WASM + Blazor is started up. That being said, as many other comments rightly point out, (for most projects,) if you work directly in the DOM you'll end up recreating what most frameworks do for you. It's really only \"worth it\" when you can strongly justify it: IE, if you're making a charting library that can handle thousands of datapoints, or a rich degree of interactivity that a usual business web site doesn't have.

The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "They're probably using some features of LiveView; I'm not too familiar with how  HTMX works, but with LiveView you can define all of your logic and state handling on the _backend_, with page diffs pushed to the client over a websocket channel (all handled out of the box). It comes with some tradeoffs compared to fully client-side state, but it's a really comfortable paradigm to program in, especially if you're not from a frontend background, and really clicks with the wider Elixir/Erlang problem solving approach. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#handlin... Hooks let you do things like have your DOM update live, but then layer on some JS in response. For example you could define a custom `<chart>` component, which is inserted into the DOM with `data-points=[...]`, and have a hook then 'hydrate' it with e.g. a D3 or VegaLite plot. Since Phoenix/LiveView is handling the state, your JS needs only be concerned about that last-mile JS integration; no need to pair it with another virtual DOM / state management system. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#client-... reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else. Thus React has been the most stable bet for quite a while for me now. reply",

Obsidian is not a web application. It is a desktop and mobile application. There is presently no Obsidian web application. So it would be odd to be asking about web frameworks for a non-web desktop and mobile application. > Electron is just a way of running Chrome without the Chrome UI around it, + a few APIs for accessing native OS APIs. No, Electron is a complete Javascript-based application framework. It does so much more[1] than that. 1. https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app reply",

          "text": "I mean, you're correct that Obsidian doesn't run on the browser. But it's built on web technologies. As a result, I would argue that the overlap between the skillset and work needed to build an app like Obsidian overlaps more with most web applications than most desktop and mobile applications. You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application. How to build a large front-end app on non-web technologies (Swift, C++/QT, C#, etc) is also an interesting question but I didn't understand that as being the topic of this conversation. reply",

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

          "text": "The reasons I avoid large frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and even jQuery is that they are aren't necessary.  They are code decoration that slows things down.  Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

Manually modifying the DOM on changes means writing the same logic several times, once for the initial render and then repeated in every event handler that has change the state of the UI. Alternatively, you might just be nuking your DOM with inner html and then running everything again through the initial rendering logic. But this isn't ideal, components loose focus, there can be glitches, and it can get slow. Not sure how you could make the type of complex UI heavy apps and have any greater flexibility or faster maintenance. reply",

You don't need to litter your code, most especially your DOM nodes, with a bunch of business logic insanity. All you need is the event handler.  The event handler can be assigned to a node's event property directly, but if this is for a commercial site with lots of third party analytics/spyware you need to use a event listener instead because those third party libraries will overwrite your event assignments.  The event handler receives an event object as an argument with a reference back to the given DOM node. All the business logic should be stored in a single location representing a given business function, typically far away from the browser logic.  It makes sense when you write the code without using a framework.  If you write the code and try to make it look like a framework it will look like a framework, unsurprisingly.

Could you recommend any alternative DOS Versions or task switchers better suited to that?<p>Programs I didn't try\n* MS multitasking DOS (to which the source was released not long ago)\n* DRDOS\n* Any other variant of DOS?<p>IMHO the experience under OS/2 was best.<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5.

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information.

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

This covers not just the chemical analysis but also product acquisition, shipping, and operational costs. Right now there is only about 10% margin left as breathing room.

The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

          "text": "I am working on the little book of algorithms: https://github.com/little-book-of/algorithms A project to implement 1000 algorithms. I have finished around 400 so far and I am now focusing on adding test cases, writing implementations in Python and C, and creating formal proofs in Lean. It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves. If anyone has thoughts on how to structure the proofs or improve the testing setup, I would love to hear ideas or feedback. reply",

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.  And some data visualizations as in Sedgewick's book would also be helpful. reply",

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

It also came with no support, no community and no planned updates (the project was shelved half a year later in favor of inferno) More than the price tag the problem is that plan 9 wasn't really released until 2004. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

          "text": ">- XHTML. [...] Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly? XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

One of the joys of learning HTML when it tended to be hand-written was that if you made a mistake, you'd still see something just with distorted output. That was a lot more approachable for a lot of people who were put off \"real\" programming languages because they were overwhelmed by terrible error messages any time they missed a bracket or misspelled something. If you've learned to program in the last decade or two, you might not even realise just how bad compiler errors tended to be in most languages. The kind of thing where you could miss a bracket on line 47 but end up with a compiler error complaining about something 20 lines away. Rust ( in particular ) got everyone to bring up their game with respect to meaningful compiler errors. But in the days of XHTML?

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV. But you're also insane expecting a small reseller of some small company to pull your chestnuts out of the fire. reply",

Migrating part of the farm and A/B testing shows good results and we’ll be able to complete it in-place before the next pizzo payment to Broadcom is due. Thanks for the nudge, Broadcom!

They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

          "text": "Hi, im a presales engineer for OVHcloud, a cloud provider. OVH is a \"pinacle\" VMware partner, we are a huge reseller of VMware licenses, and were able to secure a 3-5 years contract with broadcom with only 5 to 15% of price increase. Of course, the clients I talk with are mostly interested in moving to the cloud or are already in the cloud, so it won't be applicable to you if you'd stay on-prem. I wanted to share my experience. For some clients, change of  technology would be more expensive than paying a bit more to VMware. You'd have to re-train half your IT department, and the migration could be long, risky and complexe. So in this case, a lift and shift move-to-cloud can be competitive, and frankly a serious option. I see a lot of projects with Nutanix, but you'd be surprise of the price, which is almost the same as VMware. Nutanix comes with way more features than vanilla vsphere which explains the cost increase. You'd have NSX and vSAN packaged, plus replication features. Nutanix offers a great alternative. Actually, OVH proposes Nutanix too, so we can be agnostic and have a sort of leverage over Broadcom. Some clients are ok to move to public cloud (equivalent AWS/Azure..). The smaller the infra the easier it is. It can be very cheap at OVH. Also it's great if you do containers because of the universal nature of them, they are easy to migrate.\nHowever, If the client has a lot of Windows Server, the cost is actually higher (at OVH the price of the Windows Server Licence is higher than at Azure..) because we cannot leverage the Windows Datacenter licenses The cheapest viable option is to go to Proxmox on Baremetal servers. The features are close to a standard vSphere environnement. The lack of enterprise support is the thing that stops most clients to do this move. reply",

Organisations tend to think and react strategically, and this will mean 3-5 year (or more) financial projections for major projects. If a $1m VMWare annual bill is now $8m, over 5 years thats $5m vs $40m. A change to a $1m annually cluster isn't going to cost you $35m, so you should definitely look at changing to minimise your expenses, assuming you get the support etc that you need elsewhere. reply",

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

Discord's telemetry was broken on my browser, and on failure they immediately retried. It didn't take many actions queued up on the site before my browser was initiating over 100RPS, on their behalf. 2. Target and eBay still flag my sessions as bot traffic (presumably because they don't recognize the user agent or because I use Linux or something). Target allows browsing their site for a few items before heavily rate-limiting me for a day or so, and eBay just resets my password a day or two after I log in, every single bloody time. The problem is that from time to time normal users will generate large traffic volumes, and if the bot owner uses many IPs then you're forced to use less reliable signals for that ban hammer (i.e., no single user will be near 700 RPS). reply",

I wrote a quick-and-dirty program that reads the authoritative list of all AWS IP ranges from https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json (more about that URL at the blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ip-ranges-json/ ), and creates rules in Windows Firewall to simply block all of them.  Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

From my perspective, the monitoring alerts that bubble up from our infrastructure have always felt like a massive distraction. I'll get a page for \"High CPU\" on a service, spend an hour digging through logs and dashboards, only to find out it was just a temporary traffic spike and not a real issue. It feels like a huge waste of developer time.\nMy hypothesis is that the tools we use are too focused on static thresholds (e.g., \"CPU &gt; 80%\") and lack the context to tell us what's actually an anomaly. I've been exploring a different approach based on peer-group comparisons (e.g., is api-server-5 behaving differently from its peers api-server-1 through 4?).\nBut I'm coming at this from a dev perspective and I'm very aware that I might be missing the bigger picture. I'd love to learn from the people who live and breathe this stuff.\nHow much developer time is lost at your company to investigating \"false positive\" infrastructure alerts?\nDo you think the current tools (Datadog, Prometheus, etc.) create a significant burden for dev teams?\nIs the idea of \"peer-group context\" a sensible direction, or are there better ways to solve this that I'm not seeing?\nI haven't built much yet because I'm committed to solving a real problem.

The problem you’re starting to run into is that you’re seeing the monitors as useless, which will ultimately lead to ignoring them, so when there is a problem you won’t know it. What you should be doing is tuning the monitors to make them useful. If your app will see occasional spikes that last 10 minutes, and the monitor checks every 5 minutes, set it to only create an alert after 3 consecutive failures. That creates some tolerance for spikes, but will still alert you if there is a prolonged issue that needs to be addressed due to the inevitable performance issues it will cause. If there are other alerts that happen often that need action taken, which is repeatable, that’s where EDA (Event Driven Automation) would come in. Write some code to fix what needs to be fixed, and when the alert comes in the code automatically runs to fix it. You then only need to handle it when the EDA code can’t fix the issue. Fix it once in code instead of every time you get an alert. reply",

          "text": "A lot of what we used it for was to compensate for non-responsive dev teams or vendor apps that we couldn't fix. EDA felt like a tool for the powerless. We can't fix the real problem, but we can automate the band-aid. I was on an ops team dealing with hundreds of apps and teams. They didn't care of ops had to restart their app constantly, it wasn't their problem. We had a lot of alerts where restarting a service would fix it, so we had EDA do that. That effectively freed up 3 resources to do other things just for a single application we monitored. We have some EDA for disk cleanup, to delete files in some \"safe\" directories common to the OS, not applications. More often than not, the disk space issues are due to the application team and they really need to clean things up or make their own cleanup job. If you're the application owner you can be much more targeted, where I had to write something that would work for hundreds of different app teams. But of course if you own the app you can fix the excessive logging issues at the source, which is even better. Some vendor apps left a lot of junk out there. We'd clean up BladeLogic temp files (back when we used that) and of course temp directories that people never bothered to clean up. Another thing we've used it for was to enrich the data in the alert ticket. If the first thing you do when getting a certain alert is to check various logs or run certain commands to get more information, have the EDA do that and put that data right in the ticket so you already have it. One simple example we had was for ping alerts. In many cases a ping alert would clear on it's own, so we added some EDA to check the uptime on the server and put that information into the ticket. This way the ops person could quickly see if the server rebooted. If that reboot was unexpected the app team should be made aware and verify their app. Without that, a clear alert would be assumed to be some network latency and dismissed as \"noise\". Depending on how quickly an EDA band-aid can role out vs the fix, EDA can also buy you time while you implement the real fix, so you're not bogged down with operational work. This is especially true if the real fix for a problem will require massive changes that could take months to actually implement. For a while we had a lot of issues with BTRFS filesystems, and we ended up making some EDA to run the btrfs balance when we started getting in the danger zone, to avoid the server locking up. This was a way to keep things under control and take the pressure off of the ops team while we migrated away from btrfs, which was a multi-year undertaking. Reporting on your alert tickets should highlight any opportunities you might have, if they exist. If you have an ops team, ask them too, they'll know. But of course, if they can be fixed in the code, or the monitor just needs to be tuned, that's even better. EDA should be a last resort (other than the ticket enrichment use case). The danger of EDA is that it can push problems to the back burner. If there is a chronic issues and EDA is taking care of it, the root causes is never resolved, because it's no longer the squeaky wheel. If you go down the EDA route, it is a good idea to report on how often it runs, and review is regularly to drive improvements in the app. High numbers of EDA resolved alerts shouldn't be the goal. Ideally, those EDA metrics should also be driven down as the apps improve, just like you'd want to see from alerts being handled by humans. At the end of the day, they are still undesirable events that reduce the stability of your environment. reply",

That still requires writing Ansible playbooks, not to mention the overhead of AAP. I don’t remember the name, but I sat in on a demo of an AI powered EDA platform probably 6 years ago (before the LLM craze). Their promise was that it would automatically figure out what to do and do it, and over time it would handle more and more incidents. It sounded a little terrifying. I could see it turning into a chaos monkey, but who knows. Either way, there are some mature tools out there.

P2 is a mid-tier and only expected to get a response during business hours.  That's where I send things that are maybe an issue or can wait, like storage filling up (but not critically so).  P3 alerts get sent to a Slack channel, and exist mostly so if you get a P1 alert you can get a quick view of \"things that are odd\" like CPU spiking. For monitoring, I try to only page on user-visible issues.  Eg I don't routinely monitor CPU usage, because it doesn't correlate to user-visible issues very well.  Lots of things can cause CPU to spike, and if it's not impacting users then I don't care.  Ditto for network usage, disk IO, etc, etc.  Presuming your service does network calls, the 2 things you really care about are success rate and latency.  A drop in success rate should trigger a P1 page, and an increase in latency should trigger a P2 alert if it's higher than you'd like but okay and a P1 alert at the \"this is impacting users\" point.  You may want to split those out by endpoint as well, because your acceptable latency probably differs by endpoint. If your service can't scale, you might also want to adjust those alerts by traffic levels (i.e. if you know you can't handle 10k QPS and you can't scale past 10k QPS, there's no point in paging someone). You can also add some automation, especially if the apps are stateless.  If api-server-5 is behaving weirdly, kill it and spin up a new api-server-5 (or reboot it if physical).  A lot of the common first line of defense options are pretty automatable, and can save you from getting paged if an automated restart will fix it.  You probably do want some monitoring and rate limiting over that as well, though.  E.g. a P2 alert that api-server-5 has been rebooted 4 times today, because repeated reboots are probably an indication of an underlying issue even if reboots temporarily resolve it. reply",

          "text": "You could, but I personally wouldn't for a few reasons. The first is that it's there are simpler ways that are faster and easier to implement.  Just develop a strategy for identifying whether page are actionable.  Depends on your software, but most should support tagging or comments.  Make a standard for tagging them as \"actioned on\" or \"not actionable\", and write a basic script that iterates over the alerts you've gotten in the past 30 or 90 days and shows the number of times the alert fired and what percentage of times it was tagged as unactionable.  Set up a meeting to run that report once a week or month, and either remove or reconfigure alerts that are frequently tagged as not actionable. The second is that I don't AI are great at that kind of number crunching.  I'm sure you could get it to work, but if it's not your primary product then that time is sort of wasted.  Paying for the tokens is one thing, but messing with RAG for the 85th time trying to get the AI to do the right thing is basically wasted time. The last is that I don't like per alert costs, because it creates an environment ripe for cost-cutting by making alerting worse.  If people have in the back of their head that it costs $0.05 every time an alert fires, the mental bar for \"worth creating a low-priority alert\" goes up.  You don't want that friction to setting up alerts.  You may not care about the cost now, but I'd put down money that it becomes a thing at some point.  Alerting tends to scale superlinearly with the popularity of the product.  You add tiers to the architecture and need to have more alerts for more integration points, and your SLOs tighten so the alerts have to be more finnicky, and suddenly you're spending $2,000 a month just on alert routing. reply",

          "text": "Alerting has to be a constant iterative process. Some things should be nice to know, and some things should be \"halt what you are doing and investigate\". The latter needs to really be decided based on what your SLI/SLAs have been defined as, and need to be high quality indicators. Whenever one of the halt-and-do things alerts start to be less high signal they should be downgraded or thresholds should be increased. Like I said, an iterative process. When you are talking about a system owned by a team there should be some occasional semi-formal review of current alerting practices and when someone is on-call and notices flaky/bad alerting they should spend time tweaking/fixing so the next person doesn't have the same churn. There isn't a simple way but having some tooling to go from alert -> relevant dashboards -> remediation steps can help cut down on the process... it takes a lot of time investment to make these things work in a way that allows you to save time and not spend more time solving issues. FWIW I think developers need to be deeply involved in this process and basically own it. Static thresholds usually would just be a warning to look at later, you want more service level indicators. For example if you have a streaming system you probably want to know if one of your consumers are stuck or behind by a certain amount, and also if there is any measurable data loss. If you have automated pushes, you would probably want alerting for a push that is x amount of time stale. For rpc type systems you would want some recurrent health checks that might warn on cpu/etc but put higher severity alerting on whether or not responses are correct and as expected or not happening at all. As a solo dev it might be easier just to do the troubleshooting process every time, but as a team grows it becomes a huge time sink and troubleshooting production issues is stressful, so the goal is to make it as easy as possible. Especially if downtime == $$. I don't have good recommendations for tooling because I have used mostly internal tools but generally this is my experience. reply",

          "text": "If \"CPU > 80%\" is not an error state for your application, then that is a pointless alert and it should be removed. Ideally alerts should only be generated when ($severity_of_potential_bad_state * $probability_of_that_state) is high. In other words, for marginally bad states, you want a high confidence before alerting. For states that are really mega bad, it may be OK to loosen that and alert when you are less confident that it is actually occurring. IME CPU% alerts are typically totally spurious in a modern cloud application. In general, to get the most out of your spend, you actually want your instances working close to their limits because the intent is to scale out when your application gets busy. Therefore, you instead want to monitor things that are as close to user experience or business metric as possible. P99 request latency, 5xx rate, etc. are OK, but ideally you go even further into application-specific metrics. For example, Facebook might ask: What's the latency between uploading a cat picture and getting its first like? reply",

In a system like that, not every alert demands immediate response... a single high cpu page doesn't demand a quick response, and the appropriate response could be 'cpu was high for a short time, I don't need to look at anything else' Of course, you could be missing an important signal that should have been investigated, too.

          "text": "Most of the time checking for \"typical\" thresholds for infrastructure will yield more noise than signal. By typical thresholds I mean things like CPU Usage %, Memory Consumed and so on. My typical recommendation for clients who want to implement infrastructure is \"Don't bother\". You are better off in most cases measuring impact to user-facing services such as web page response times, task completion times for batch jobs and so on.\nIf I have a client who is insistent on monitoring their infrastructure I tell them to monitor different metrics. For CPU, check for CPU IOWait\nFor memory, check for Memory swap-in rate\nFor disk, check for latency or queue depth\nFor network, check for dropped packets All you want to check at an infrastructure layer is whether there is a bottleneck and what that bottleneck is. Whether an application is using 10% or 99% of available memory is moot if the application isn't impacted by it. The above metrics are indicators (but not always proof) that a resource is being bottlenecked and needs investigation. Monitor further up the application stack, check for error code rates over time, implement tracing to the extent that you can for core user journeys, ignore infrastructure-level monitoring until you have no choice reply",

Maybe CPU alarms should be that: CPU activity which is (a) X percent above the 24 hour average, (b) persistently for a certain duration, is alarm worthy. So 100% CPU wouldn't be alarm-worthy for a node that is always at 100% CPU, as an expected condition: very busy sytem constantly loaded down.

So I must be missing something—why is this possible?<p>Imagine if the government required car license plates, but instead of issuing them itself or through its affiliates, there was a parasitic middleman that the government required you to buy from. I know ICANN is somewhat similar, but ICANN is effectively a child of a U.S. defense agency, so it makes sense—and you can buy domains from multiple companies.<p>Why isn’t ISBN funded and run by a government agency, like the U.S. Trademark Office?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "The SBN, later ISBN, system was not created by 'Merica. The SBN system was created by a professor as a commissioned work for WH Smith, a UK-based bookseller. Later the ISO took over and standardized the ISBN. ISBNs are not legally required by the government, any more than a book is required to have a title. They are a convenience for getting a book out there in retail channels and have it be identifiable, trackable, etc. Any other person or group is free to invent a new system and get everyone in the book industry to adopt it alongside or as a replacement for ISBNs. The U.S. government is not making you get an ISBN for your book. Many books are published without one. But neither did the U.S. government step up in 1970 and offer to be the issuer, unlike in many other countries like India and Canada. So the U.S. is in the minority of countries where a for-profit company ended up getting the right to be the issuer for that country. Considering that the vast majority of books in the U.S. are published by huge for-profit publishers, it doesn't seem that bad to have them pay the issuer $30 for a ISBN if they want the convenience. It's a free country, so they are free to eschew the ISBN as well. I guess if you feel so strongly about it, you can lobby Congress to buy out R.R. Bowker, make the Librarian of Congress the registrar offering ISBNs for free, so they can add to the so-called Deep State! reply",

( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

Hooks are ~~7~~ 6 years+8months old, almost 7 years. This may not seem like a significant difference, but IMO it puts them 75% of the way back in time to when react took off versus 50% of the way. That is a significant difference. Please stop repeating the 5 year number. It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

It may have changed in the last year, but if you searched for \"CRA\", it would get 0 results. Again, mind-blowing considering it was the recommended way to build apps with React. Instead, it was replaced with a section driving you towards adopting Next. Which then had to be whittled away at and updated to include other options all the while the React team acted hostile to any criticism of it. You either used Next or you were shit out of luck. > I have been outside the ecosystem for a year and looking at the shit show that is nextjs it seems things are even worse than before. My thoughts about CRA aside, you don't have to use the frameworks (I still don't). And if you remove Next from the equation, things are actually pretty cool. Suspense is cool, and you'll have to rip React Query from my cold, dead hands. reply",

Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

          "text": "First, I decide if I think the app will have lots of client-side interaction. As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

Edit: for a more practical example, you don't need to go down the web components rabbithole just for native reactive components, MutationObserver can watch for your template fragments entering and exiting the DOM and run your init/destruct routines on them. Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver. Honestly, add some event signaling and XHR and you're further along to a smooth SPA-like experience than you might think. reply",

That’s true; you can tweak the framework to match your use case. For an analogy, look at Apple. They have much greater control over their hardware stack than the typical PC manufacturer.

Any complicated web app will always hit some kind of corner case where you need to bypass your framework and manipulate an element. For example, the spinner that you see on https://manage.onopti.com/ is disabled with a pure DOM call once WASM + Blazor is started up. That being said, as many other comments rightly point out, (for most projects,) if you work directly in the DOM you'll end up recreating what most frameworks do for you. It's really only \"worth it\" when you can strongly justify it: IE, if you're making a charting library that can handle thousands of datapoints, or a rich degree of interactivity that a usual business web site doesn't have. But for a typical interactive website: Use whatever framework your peers at your company will be comfortable with. reply",

          "text": "You're spot on — building large frontend apps without a framework is totally viable, and Obsidian is a great example. The key is leaning into web platform APIs and modular architecture. Here’s how I approached it for www.lendcalculator.com, a browser-based financial tool with dozens of calculators and dynamic UI — all built without React, Vue, or Angular.\nHow to Build Large Apps Without a Framework\nUse native modules + ES6 classes Structure your app like a library: each feature (calculator, modal, form) is its own module. Import/export keeps things clean. Leverage Web Components (if needed) They’re part of the platform now — encapsulation, lifecycle hooks, and reusability without vendor lock-in. Use vanilla JS + CSS for UI With querySelector, addEventListener, and fetch, you can build surprisingly rich interfaces. CSS Grid and Flexbox handle layout beautifully. State management via custom stores or events You don’t need Redux — just use CustomEvent, localStorage, or a simple pub/sub pattern.\nRouting with History API Use pushState and popstate to manage navigation. Works great for SPAs. Build tools: Vite, ESBuild, or even just Rollup You can still bundle, minify, and hot-reload without a framework.

The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else.

Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. The vendor lock-in on NextJS is certainly much more egregious than other frameworks. They have their own undocumented build flag to give different build outputs that Vercel uses vs the build outputs that are documented. Hosting nextjs on your infrastructure is not as simple as sticking it into a docker file as with most frameworks And I would also push back on the idea that every framework has vendor lock in. Remix was so focused on \"using the platform\" that it basically willed itself out of existence. It's no longer even a framework. Just part of the react-router library. I've also used Astro which is a framework of similar complexity and feature richness as Nextjs and certainly has no \"lock in\". At least as far as reply",

As a result, I would argue that the overlap between the skillset and work needed to build an app like Obsidian overlaps more with most web applications than most desktop and mobile applications. You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application. How to build a large front-end app on non-web technologies (Swift, C++/QT, C#, etc) is also an interesting question but I didn't understand that as being the topic of this conversation. reply",

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

          "text": "The reasons I avoid large frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and even jQuery is that they are aren't necessary.  They are code decoration that slows things down.  Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

          "text": "You are still thinking in terms of framework goodness, which is why this is challenging for you.  Don't do that.  Don't redraw anything.  Don't create some shallow copy, cloned node, or other insanity.  You don't need any of that.  You don't need to litter your code, most especially your DOM nodes, with a bunch of business logic insanity. All you need is the event handler.  The event handler can be assigned to a node's event property directly, but if this is for a commercial site with lots of third party analytics/spyware you need to use a event listener instead because those third party libraries will overwrite your event assignments.  The event handler receives an event object as an argument with a reference back to the given DOM node. All the business logic should be stored in a single location representing a given business function, typically far away from the browser logic.  It makes sense when you write the code without using a framework.  If you write the code and try to make it look like a framework it will look like a framework, unsurprisingly.  If you don't do a bunch of framework component insanity it will not look like a framework. This is a person problem, not a technology problem. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi Hacker News,<p>I'm working on a c compiler from scratch and am in a bit of a deadzone figuring out how I can test the generated AST and assembly output. I'm specifically having a hard time finding something that is viable for a one person project and which is also useful.<p>I did some research on Clang and saw they use a custom Filecheck library. This looks incredible for a production grade compiler but for mine I'm not sure if I want to put in all of the effort (especially because my host language F# doesn't have a Filecheck lib and I would have to re-create it).<p>Same with the AST - the best I can think of is creating the nodes in my host code language. This is verbose.<p>What have you done to test and check your compiler output, any good recommendations for me? I'm happy to research or read anything. Please keep in mind I'm going for a good effort to reward ratio.</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

For example, there are two individuals who own the same $100k machine for testing the performance of loudspeakers. https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/ Both of them do measurements and YouTube videos. Neither one has a particularly good index of their completed reviews, let alone tools to compare the data.

And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

          "text": "As a bio hobbyist, this is fantastic!  I don't do enough volume of PCR to think of it as expensive, but your use case of high-volume/automatic sounds fantastic! (And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

          "text": "Before generics, Go sorting usually looked like this: type ByValue []int func (a ByValue) Len() int           { return len(a) }\nfunc (a ByValue) Swap(i, j int)      { a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i] }\nfunc (a ByValue) Less(i, j int) bool { return a[i] < a[j] } sort.Sort(ByValue(a)) It worked fine but felt a bit awkward for small programs. After Go 1.18, you can do it directly with generics: s := []int{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9}\nslices.Sort(s) Much simpler and expressive, yet still type safe. I really like how Go kept it minimal without adding too many abstractions. reply",

For example, on court cases, I want to know what ends up happening, how those SC or Fed court rulings actually impact businesses, etc.<p>Anyone know any news organizations tracking that type of stuff so that interested peeps can keep getting updates?<p>And finally, are there any news websites that are screening out day to day stuff and just posting monthly status on what is going on to help put the trend in context?<p>Everything just seems like 100 voices in a room screaming for attention and no context or decision on what is really important or fascinating...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I rely on my YOShInOn RSS reader for news on a wide range of topics,  with the caveat that it isn't particular fast.  For news about science and technology it doesn't matter if it is delayed two weeks,  but it is a problem for sports where you don't run to look at an article about what happened in week 6 of the NFL after week 7 goes down. I am lucky that Ithaca has several weekly papers,  both print and web-based,  that make up for the fact that our \"paper of record\" is a zombie.  It used to be when a local election happened I would buy an Ithaca Journal the next day to see the results,  but now the head office updates that paper around 3pm in the afternoon the next day .  Our board of elections usually posts the results around 8pm the night of the election and all the 'alternative' papers run articles on it right away -- the Ithaca Journal used to send reporters to public meetings but no more,  no wonder there is a movement to defund it by taking public notices out of it. reply",

          "text": "LLMs help you think about news in an interesting way. News is just filling your context at all times. If you remove certain things from the context window, the LLM literally can't think about it. For example, if you don't want the LLM to think about war, remove it from the context. When it comes to news, most people are operating with a very curated mental context. They don't even think about certain things. To get the right picture from news, you'd need to be willing to hold a lot of context in your head, which means you have to consume any and all news from everywhere whether you like it or not. History enthusiasts already know this and actively try to fill their context with as much history as possible too. In other words, don't try to curate your mental context if you want the truth. reply",

          "text": "That’s a fascinating way to frame it — treating news as a dynamic context window, like how LLMs operate. I agree that selective exposure shapes not just what we think about, but what we’re capable of thinking with. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces hidden. At the same time, I wonder if there’s a balance. Curating context might be necessary for mental clarity, especially when the volume of global news is overwhelming. Maybe the goal isn’t to consume everything, but to design systems (or habits) that surface the most structurally important signals — the kind that shape long-term outcomes. I’ve been working on tools that simplify decision-making in finance, and this idea of “context compression” really resonates.

Again, the simplest thing people do is put up their mental firewall and don’t manage the whitelist. That means things don’t even get through to be classified as important. The other variant of that is there is no filter at all, but the person lacks the ability to classify anything as important (classified incorrectly). If we filter correctly, and classify correctly, that’s probably best. The filter part is easy, just do it. The classification part requires, in my opinion, some kind of value system. reply",

I think that’s where most people struggle: not just in filtering noise, but in knowing what matters to them long-term. In finance, I’ve seen this play out when people chase trends without anchoring decisions to personal goals or values. That’s why I’ve been exploring ways to build tools that help users define their own “signal criteria” — not just what gets through, but why it’s worth acting on.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m 28 (m) and have a Computer Science degree under my belt. A few years after graduating, I pursued a teaching degree because it came with a great tax-free incentive. Now I’ve realised I want to use my original degree and get back into tech.<p>After my degree I didn't want to pursue it as I fell out of love with it, possibly due to stress and letting uni life get the better of me. It became stressful environment but through recent experiences and talking with close friends who are in the field of CS, overtime I've realised and processed that I still have a massive interest and constant want to learn more within it or somewhat be involved in it. The years of teaching it has definitely played a part in showing students my passion for the subject, reminding myself how much I love it too.<p>I've started picking up on python again and taking online courses to refresh myself but I want to make myself employable after these years. I have previous experience in java, php and C+ also. I've never worked in a professional coding environment either, hence why I am coming on here to seek advice on what would be best.<p>Any recommendations/advice would really help. What stacks I should be looking at?</p></p></p></div>",

I assume that I should be learning new tools too as in 5 years, a lot can change in the programming world.

          "text": "There's an old saying - those who know, do. Those who don't, teach. In essence, you might have the knowledge, but you have no practice. That makes you mostly unemployable in tech. But good news is that many companies want to fill some quotas and they require degrees, so you'll likely find some place in a larger company where what you can do means less than the letters that go before or after your name. A situation from a personal experience - some years go, in a company where I worked at(advertising agency, i handled the websites), we were looking to hire someone. I do not rememebr what position it was. We were small company, 15-ish people. We got a ton of CVs. I rememebr one specific CV - there was a guy who had THREE university diplomas and was in his 30s, but had no work experience. This guy had 0 chance of being picked and his CV went straight to the trash bin. In tech, this is 10x more prominent as this sector is about what you can actually do and what you did in the past. Not what you know in theory and whatnot. It is what it is. Good luck with your search. Definitely pick some popular language though, to broaden up your pool of opportunities. Don't be looking for Rust jobs or any of that nonsense. And don't expect large salary either. You have to earn it. reply",

But in tech, realistically, the value of a diploma is 0. Again, focus on a popular language, do some projects with it(so you have something to showcase) and after you get hired you can start specialising on specific things. Like web services, 3D engines, database and whatever else you'd want or need. In short, you have to be smart about transitioning from academia into the \"real world\". As you have a diploma and you have been teaching, it means you are likely in your 30s, which is great, because id you would be Gen-Z or Gen-A, you'd have much harder time getting hired.

          "text": "The Plan 9 operating system. It's the closest thing to a Unix successor we ever got, taking the \"everything is a file\" philosophy to another level and allowing to easily share those files over the network to build distributed systems. Accessing any remote resources is easy and robust on Plan9, meanwhile on other systems we need to install specialized software with bad interoperability for each individual use case. Plan9 also had some innovative UI features, such as mouse chording to edit text, nested window managers, the Plumber to run user-configurable commands on known text patterns system-wide, etc. Its distributed nature should have meant it's perfect for today's world with mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT devices all connected to each other. Instead, we're stuck with operating systems that were never designed for that. There are still active forks of Plan9 such as 9front, but the original from Bell Labs is dead. The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same. Maybe something like FIDL is a proper solution but I have only read a little about it: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/fidl/fidl reply",

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

          "text": "- Photon, the graphical interface for QNX. Oriented more towards real time (widgets included gauges) but good enough to support two different web browsers. No delays. This was a real time operating system. - MacOS 8. Not the Linux thing, but Copeland. This was a modernized version of the original MacOS, continuing the tradition of no command line. Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required. Killed by Google in favor of hosted Google Translate. reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. You have things backwards. The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

          "text": ">- XHTML. [...] Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly? XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

Postel’s Law was wrong: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9413 We stop at the first sign of trouble for almost every other format, we do not need lax parsing for HTML. This has caused a multitude of security vulnerabilities and only makes it more difficult for pretty much everybody.

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

Another possibility they were exploring was buying BeOS, which would have been pretty interesting because it was an OS built from scratch in the 90's without any of the cruft from the 70's. Also, the only thing specific to Next that survived in MacOSX and iOS was ObjectiveC and the whole NextStep APIs, which honestly I don't think it a great thing. It was pretty cool in the 90's but when the iPhone was released it was already kinda obsolete. For the kernel, Linux or FreeBSD would have worked just the same. reply",

It was originally more planned to be a Blackberry competitor, and the early Android handset prototype concepts were all blackberry knockoffs with similar physical keyboard layouts.

It's worthwhile to remember that the industry wasn't nearly as convinced that touching glass was the future of mobile typing in 2007 as it later became, and the sales volume of Blackberrys back then was often incorrectly cited as evidence to support the case against touch. > https://www.bgr.com/tech/iphone-vs-android-original-google-b... reply",

We were only quickly tipped off because they had to open a ticket to get the limit raised. If you haven't check newly made Roles as well. We quashed the compromised users pretty quickly (including my own, the origin we figured out), but got a little lucky because I just started cruising the Roles and killing anything less than a month old or with admin access. To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request. It is entirely possible whomever did your thing had you compromised for a bit, and then once AWS went down they decided that was the perfect time to attack, when you might not notice just-another-AWS-thing happening. reply",

Based on docs and some of the concerns about this happening to someone else, I would probably start with the following: 1. Check who/what created those EC2s[0] using the console to query: eventSource:ec2.amazonaws.com eventName:RunInstances 2. Based on the userIdentity field, query the following actions. 3. Check if someone manually logged into Console (identity dependent) [1]: eventSource:signin.amazonaws.com userIdentity.type:[Root/IAMUser/AssumedRole/FederatedUser/AWSLambda] eventName:ConsoleLogin 4. Check if someone authenticated against Security Token Service (STS) [2]: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:GetSessionToken 5. Check if someone used a valid STS Session to AssumeRole: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:AssumeRole  userIdentity.arn (or other identifier) 6. Check for any new IAM Roles/Accounts made for persistence: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateUser OR eventName:DeleteUser) 7.  Check if any already vulnerable IAM Roles/Accounts modified to be more permissive [3]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateRole OR eventName:DeleteRole OR eventName:AttachRolePolicy OR eventName:DetachRolePolicy) 8. Check for any access keys made [4][5]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateAccessKey OR eventName:DeleteAccessKey) 9. Check if any production / persistent EC2s have had their IAMInstanceProfile changed, to allow for a backdoor using EC2 permissions from a webshell/backdoor they could have placed on your public facing infra. [6] etc. etc. But if you have had a compromise based on initial investigations, probably worth while getting professional support to do a thorough audit of your environment.

This is because of something called a \"collapse hit\" where two requests that occur at the same time and are identical (according to your cache key) get merged together into a single origin request. CloudFront isn't \"storing\" anything, but the effect is still that a user gets a copy of a response that was already returned to a different user. > https://stackoverflow.com/a/69455222 > If your app authenticates based on cookies or some other header, and that header isn't part of the cache key, it's possible for one user to get a response intended for a different user. To fix it you have to make sure any headers that affect the server response are in the cache key, even if the server always returns no-store. --- Though the AWS docs seem to imply that no-store is effective: > If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 and configure the origin to send Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-store, Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: max-age=0, or Cache-Control: s-maxage=0. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Develope... reply",

          "text": "- Secure backups protected from being tainted by malware replicated to multiple locations and only ever shared as read-only. - Treat most servers and clients as cattle, keeping end-user data on backed up and redundant hardened specific purpose servers in small very secured networks. - Enable detailed logging in auditd and set it immutable to change conf requires reboot .  Send important alerts to multiple SIEM servers. - Avoid sending \"noise\" events to syslog/SIEM to prevent alert fatigue. - Enable spooling and TLS TCP transport in the local syslog. - Enforce mandatory access controls such as SELinux or AppArmor.  Ensure all applications are fully enforced. - All applications, 3rd party libraries go through strict security review, change control. - No real time connections to 3rd party networks for dependencies.  Everything is local in the datacenter or Cloud account after being code and security reviewed. - Have a manifest per code deployment of all known checksums of all files.  Use an in house tool to periodically verify checksums and alert real time on anything that is unknown. - Run a tool to verify \"Full RELRO\", \"Stack Canary\", NX/Pax, \"PIE\" for all running daemons.  Force teams to recompile anything missing these settings. - Disable SSH multiplexing on bastion nodes and clients outside of development. Multiplexing empowers logless phishing - Do not allow direct access to production servers just because there is a VPN.  Require a highly logged jump host.  If that is too much friction for someone move them elsewhere. - Hire 3rd party code penetration testers to find \"all the things\".  Fix all the things. - Hire 3rd party penetration testers to find every real world weakness in the infrastructure.  Have them sit with members of every org.  Tell employees to volunteer anything they see as a weakness.  Fire any C-Level that objects to this.  Have buy-in from board members. - Perform extensive background checks on all FTE candidates and executives.  Limit access to contractors by default. - Perform extensive background checks on all 3rd party vendors.  Be ready to explain findings to customers, auditors, regulatory bodies, etc... - Restore an entire production environment from scratch using only backups and code in a staging environment.  Have volunteer customers that signed additional NDAs test the restoration.  Do this on a regular schedule and ensure a non-technical manager with the appropriate access can follow the instructions. - Perform chaos monkey testing killing random nodes, unplugging random things and ensure teams can either self-heal or be quickly remediated by novice engineers. - Encourage red-team penetration testers to break things in a production-like staging environment.  Have executives and board members make it clear there are no reprisals, no consequences for bringing up taboo topics around security due to in-house politics . - Require a top-down culture of treating everyone equally.  This includes treating executives that leave their laptop unlocked and unattended exactly the same as an FTE. I could keep listing best practices but I think we know most will not do 5% of these checklist items.  Alternately stock up on pens, pencils, physical notepads.  Have printed out lists of phone numbers and addresses. reply",

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

It didn't take many actions queued up on the site before my browser was initiating over 100RPS, on their behalf. 2. Target and eBay still flag my sessions as bot traffic (presumably because they don't recognize the user agent or because I use Linux or something). Target allows browsing their site for a few items before heavily rate-limiting me for a day or so, and eBay just resets my password a day or two after I log in, every single bloody time. The problem is that from time to time normal users will generate large traffic volumes, and if the bot owner uses many IPs then you're forced to use less reliable signals for that ban hammer (i.e., no single user will be near 700 RPS). reply",

I wrote a quick-and-dirty program that reads the authoritative list of all AWS IP ranges from https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json (more about that URL at the blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ip-ranges-json/ ), and creates rules in Windows Firewall to simply block all of them.  Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

          "text": "Our 5 year ELA for VMware went from 1.5M USD to 12M USD. I work in Higher ed. Our Hyper-V environment came online a few months ago. It was already included with our ELA with Microsoft so we were able to splash out a bit for some higher tier support. Granted, we have a separate team working on \"genAI stuff.\" We started converting virtual machines about 3 weeks ago and we've gotten through ~500 of about 3500 or so. Our grant based HPC environment is just moving back to bare metal. The VM conversion is just for ad-hoc HPC and then all of our general infrastructure. Some of our larger application servers (SAP Hana) are possibly staying on VMWare if SAP won't support them on Hyper-V. This summer sucked big time but we'll make it. reply",

          "text": "This is a hot topic among some of my nerdier SME friends, and our conclusion is that the major players are HPE and Nutanix. At least from our perspective over here in Sweden. HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV.

They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

          "text": "Check out libvirtd based stacks, because that's what's supported by upstream Linux. Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

We have customers moving to OpenNebula, CloudStack, Proxmox, OpenStack, HP VME, Oracle Virtualization, and even some homegrown solutions. The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible. reply",

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

          "text": "We're driving as many apps as possible to containers, and replacing most of our virtual infrastructure with Talos Linux [1] which is a reasonably  hardened OS dedicated to Kubernetes hosting.  I strongly recommend using the terraform provider to help manage at scale.  The docs seem  a little sparse for beginners, but if you already know kubernetes concepts, it's pretty easy to pick up.  If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize. They have to explain to the board why their spending increased and they are still on legacy. - [1] - https://www.talos.dev/ reply",

          "text": "Hi, im a presales engineer for OVHcloud, a cloud provider. OVH is a \"pinacle\" VMware partner, we are a huge reseller of VMware licenses, and were able to secure a 3-5 years contract with broadcom with only 5 to 15% of price increase. Of course, the clients I talk with are mostly interested in moving to the cloud or are already in the cloud, so it won't be applicable to you if you'd stay on-prem. I wanted to share my experience. For some clients, change of  technology would be more expensive than paying a bit more to VMware. You'd have to re-train half your IT department, and the migration could be long, risky and complexe. So in this case, a lift and shift move-to-cloud can be competitive, and frankly a serious option. I see a lot of projects with Nutanix, but you'd be surprise of the price, which is almost the same as VMware. Nutanix comes with way more features than vanilla vsphere which explains the cost increase. You'd have NSX and vSAN packaged, plus replication features. Nutanix offers a great alternative. Actually, OVH proposes Nutanix too, so we can be agnostic and have a sort of leverage over Broadcom. Some clients are ok to move to public cloud (equivalent AWS/Azure..). The smaller the infra the easier it is. It can be very cheap at OVH. Also it's great if you do containers because of the universal nature of them, they are easy to migrate.\nHowever, If the client has a lot of Windows Server, the cost is actually higher (at OVH the price of the Windows Server Licence is higher than at Azure..) because we cannot leverage the Windows Datacenter licenses The cheapest viable option is to go to Proxmox on Baremetal servers. The features are close to a standard vSphere environnement. The lack of enterprise support is the thing that stops most clients to do this move. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had a mind-blown-moment when I learnt that Obsidian was built without any frontend JS framework. ( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

Since the whole project was migrated over from React, I was able to improve performance to a degree that would have been impossible using React, it's a breadth of fresh air to open the performance and memory tab and to be able to optimise things from there to get 60FPS no matter what whilst preventing massive ram usage because those frameworks runs all sort of code that is out of your control. Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

          "text": "First, I decide if I think the app will have lots of client-side interaction. As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver. Honestly, add some event signaling and XHR and you're further along to a smooth SPA-like experience than you might think. reply",

Secondly, I know something about autism, because I have a child with autism. Look at the comments in this thread.  A guy asked a question about vanilla JavaScript, a completely valid question on a site about comments upon programming links, and yet notice all the comments that are instead not about that. There are so many comments about writing React, which is not what this thread is about.  There are so many comments from people talking about themselves instead of actually about programming, much less anything about vanilla JavaScript.  There are also comments like yours that are instantly hostility towards anything about original code, a subject that you seem to find horrifying. Yes, this is incredibly autistic.  Some common traits of autism, among many more that each autistic person may or may not have: * low social intelligence, which in this context displays when developers are only thinking about themselves, what's easiest for them, and cannot think about anything else such as users or business owners * fragile ego, which in this context results in hostility at subjects that expose a developers shallow capabilities and results in false displays of high confidence to mask deeply felt insecurity I got tired of working with immature people who, in a technical capacity, could only do a little more that copy/paste template code and were otherwise generally hostile because of high insecurity.  I am now in a different line of work where I don't have babysit people. Writing original code or writing applications without a giant framework isn't challenging, but the subject certainly feels like the world is caving in for a great many people who call themselves seniors or engineers. reply",

Any complicated web app will always hit some kind of corner case where you need to bypass your framework and manipulate an element. For example, the spinner that you see on https://manage.onopti.com/ is disabled with a pure DOM call once WASM + Blazor is started up. That being said, as many other comments rightly point out, (for most projects,) if you work directly in the DOM you'll end up recreating what most frameworks do for you. It's really only \"worth it\" when you can strongly justify it: IE, if you're making a charting library that can handle thousands of datapoints, or a rich degree of interactivity that a usual business web site doesn't have.

The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else. Thus React has been the most stable bet for quite a while for me now. reply",

The vendor lock-in on NextJS is certainly much more egregious than other frameworks. They have their own undocumented build flag to give different build outputs that Vercel uses vs the build outputs that are documented. Hosting nextjs on your infrastructure is not as simple as sticking it into a docker file as with most frameworks And I would also push back on the idea that every framework has vendor lock in. Remix was so focused on \"using the platform\" that it basically willed itself out of existence. It's no longer even a framework. Just part of the react-router library. I've also used Astro which is a framework of similar complexity and feature richness as Nextjs and certainly has no \"lock in\". At least as far as reply",

          "text": "You're spot on — building large frontend apps without a framework is totally viable, and Obsidian is a great example. The key is leaning into web platform APIs and modular architecture. Here’s how I approached it for www.lendcalculator.com, a browser-based financial tool with dozens of calculators and dynamic UI — all built without React, Vue, or Angular.\nHow to Build Large Apps Without a Framework\nUse native modules + ES6 classes Structure your app like a library: each feature (calculator, modal, form) is its own module. Import/export keeps things clean. Leverage Web Components (if needed) They’re part of the platform now — encapsulation, lifecycle hooks, and reusability without vendor lock-in. Use vanilla JS + CSS for UI With querySelector, addEventListener, and fetch, you can build surprisingly rich interfaces. CSS Grid and Flexbox handle layout beautifully. State management via custom stores or events You don’t need Redux — just use CustomEvent, localStorage, or a simple pub/sub pattern.\nRouting with History API Use pushState and popstate to manage navigation. Works great for SPAs. Build tools: Vite, ESBuild, or even just Rollup You can still bundle, minify, and hot-reload without a framework. Projects to Study\nObsidian (as you mentioned) CodeMirror — complex editor, no framework LendCalculator — my own project, built with vanilla JS and modular architecture reply",

As a result, I would argue that the overlap between the skillset and work needed to build an app like Obsidian overlaps more with most web applications than most desktop and mobile applications. You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application. How to build a large front-end app on non-web technologies (Swift, C++/QT, C#, etc) is also an interesting question but I didn't understand that as being the topic of this conversation. reply",

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

That is not a limitation of the language, but rather a limitation of the given developer's imagination.  The problem is thus a person problem and not a technology problem.

The event handler receives an event object as an argument with a reference back to the given DOM node. All the business logic should be stored in a single location representing a given business function, typically far away from the browser logic.  It makes sense when you write the code without using a framework.  If you write the code and try to make it look like a framework it will look like a framework, unsurprisingly.

Later the ISO took over and standardized the ISBN. ISBNs are not legally required by the government, any more than a book is required to have a title. They are a convenience for getting a book out there in retail channels and have it be identifiable, trackable, etc. Any other person or group is free to invent a new system and get everyone in the book industry to adopt it alongside or as a replacement for ISBNs. The U.S. government is not making you get an ISBN for your book. Many books are published without one. But neither did the U.S. government step up in 1970 and offer to be the issuer, unlike in many other countries like India and Canada. So the U.S. is in the minority of countries where a for-profit company ended up getting the right to be the issuer for that country. Considering that the vast majority of books in the U.S. are published by huge for-profit publishers, it doesn't seem that bad to have them pay the issuer $30 for a ISBN if they want the convenience. It's a free country, so they are free to eschew the ISBN as well. I guess if you feel so strongly about it, you can lobby Congress to buy out R.R. Bowker, make the Librarian of Congress the registrar offering ISBNs for free, so they can add to the so-called Deep State! reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be? reply",

This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information.

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

Just a treasure trove of data A man can dream - kudos to you for actually making it a reality - great inspiration Question for you: in general, how much does this stuff cost? what if you wanted to expand to testing beyond plastic, e.g., verifying the potency of ingredients in supplements, verifying cleaning product ingredients, etc., is that possible? reply",

Thanks to volume pricing and operational efficiency, we're able to target $425 per sample ($1,275 for triplicate testing). This covers not just the chemical analysis but also product acquisition, shipping, and operational costs. Right now there is only about 10% margin left as breathing room. My partner lab specifically offers 300+ unique tests across the following categories: Contaminants, Elemental, Allergen, Preservatives and Additives, Microbial, and Phytochemical, Vitamin, and Actives\" So yes, expansion is definitely possible!

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

          "text": "I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

The reasons it died are likely: - Legal challenges (Plan9 license, pointless lawsuits, etc.) meant it wssn't adopted by major players in the industry. - Plan9 was a distributed OS during a time when having a local computer became popular and affordable, while using a terminal to access a centrally managed computer fell out of fashion (though the latter sort of came back in a worse fashion with cloud computing). - Bad marketing and posing itself as merely a research OS meant they couldn't capitalize on the .com boom. - AT&T lost its near endless source of telephone revenue. Bell Labs was sold multiple times over the coming years, a lot of the Unix/Plan9 guys went to other companies like Google. reply",

          "text": "Probably the fact that it's a pretty terrible idea. It means you take a normal properly typed API and smush it down into some poorly specified text format that you now have to write probably-broken parsers for. I often find bugs in programs that interact with `/proc` on Linux because they don't expect some output (e.g. spaces in paths, or optional entries). The only reasons people think it's a good idea in the first place is a) every programming language can read files so it sort of gives you an API that works with any language (but a really bad one), and b) it's easy to poke around in from the command line. Essentially it's a hacky cop-out for a proper language-neutral API system. In fairness it's not like Linux actually came up with a better alternative. I think the closest is probably DBus which isn't exactly the same.

          "text": "The fact that everything is not a file. No OS actually implements that idea including Plan9. For example, directories are not files. Plan9 re-uses a few of the APIs for them, but you can't use write() on a directory, you can only read them. Pretending everything is a file was never a good idea and is based on an untrue understanding of computing. The everything-is-an-object phase the industry went through was much closer to reality. Consider how you represent a GUI window as a file. A file is just a flat byte array at heart, so: 1. What's the data format inside the file? Is it a raw bitmap? Series of rendering instructions? How do you communicate that to the window server, or vice-versa? What about ancillary data like window border styles? 2. Is the file a real file on a real filesystem, or is it an entry in a virtual file system? If the latter then you often lose a lot of the basic features that makes \"everything is a file\" attractive, like the ability to move files around or arrange them in a user controlled directory hierarchy. VFS like procfs are pretty limited. You can't even add your own entries like adding symlinks to procfs directories. 3. How do you receive callbacks about your window? At this point you start to conclude that you can't use one file to represent a useful object like a window, you'd need at least a data and a control file where the latter is some sort of socket speaking some sort of RPC protocol. But now you have an atomicity problem. 4. What exactly is the benefit again? You won't be able to use the shell to do much with these window files. And so on. For this reason Plan9's GUI API looked similar to that of any other OS: a C library that wrapped the underlying file \"protocol\". Developers didn't interact with the system using the file metaphor, because it didn't deliver value. All the post-UNIX operating system designs ignored this idea because it was just a bad one. Microsoft invested heavily in COM and NeXT invested in the idea of typed, IDL-defined Mach ports. reply",

Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs. - Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems. - IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought \"bus\", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had \"channels\", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS. - CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. \nIBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the \"real machine\" layer, and they're all hacks. - The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind. - Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC. - XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.\nWould it kill people to have to close their tags properly? - Word Lens.

The Copland project was horribly mismanaged. Anybody at Apple who came up with a new technology got it included in Copland, with no regard to feature creep or stability. There's a leaked build floating around from shortly before the project was cancelled. It's extremely unstable and even using basic desktop functionality causes hangs and crashes. In mid-late 1996, it became clear that Copland would never ship, and Apple decided the best course of action was to license an outside OS. They considered options such as Solaris, Windows NT, and BeOS, but of course ended up buying NeXT. Copland wasn't killed to justify buying NeXT, Apple bought NeXT because Copland was unshippable. reply",

XHTML appeals to the intuition that there should be a Strict Right Way To Do Things ... but you can't use that unforgiving framework for web documents that are widely shared. The \"real world\" has 2 types of file formats: (1) file types where consumers cannot contact/control/punish the authors (open-loop) :  HTML, pdf, zip, csv, etc.  The common theme is that the data itself is more important that the file format .  That's why Adobe Reader will read malformed pdf files written by buggy PDF libraries.  And both 7-Zip and Winrar can read malformed zip files with broken headers (because some old buggy Java libraries wrote bad zip files).  MS Excel can import malformed csv files.  E.g. the Citi bank export to csv wrote a malformed file and it was desirable that MS Excel imported it anyway because the raw data of dollar amounts was more important than the incorrect commas in the csv file -- and -- I have no way of contacting the programmer at Citi to tell them to fix their buggy code that created the bad csv file. (2) file types where the consumer can control the author (closed-loop):  programming language source code like .c, .java, etc or business interchange documents like EDI.   There's no need to have a \"lenient forgiving\" gcc/clang compiler to parse \".c\" source code because the \"consumer-and-author\" will be the same person.  I.e. the developer sees the  compiler stop at a syntax error so they edit and fix it and try to re-compile.  For business interchange formats like EDI, a company like Walmart can tell the vendor to fix their broken EDI files. XHTML wants to be in group (2) but web surfers can't control all the authors of .html so that's why lenient parsing of HTML \"wins\".  XHTML would work better in a \"closed-loop\" environment such as a company writing internal documentation for its employees.  E.g. an employee handbook can be written in strict XHTML because both the consumers and authors work at the same company.  E.g. can't see the vacation policy because the XHTML syntax is wrong?!?  Get on the Slack channel and tell the programmer or content author to fix it. reply",

File creators have zero incentive to create spec-compliant files, because there's no penalty for creating corrupted files. In practice this means a large proportion of documents are going to end up corrupt. Does it open in Chrome? Great, ship it! The file format is no longer the specification, but it has now become a wild guess at whatever weird garbage the incumbent is still willing to accept. This makes it virtually impossible to write a new parser, because the file format suddenly has no specification . On the other hand, imagine a world where Chrome would slowly start to phase out its quirks modes. Something like a yellow address bar and a \"Chrome cannot guarantee the safety of your data on this website, as the website is malformed\" warning message. Turn it into a red bar and a \"click to continue\" after 10 years, remove it altogether after 20 years. Suddenly it's no longer that one weird customer who is complaining, but everyone - including your manager. Your mistakes are painfully obvious during development, so you have a pretty good incentive to properly follow the spec. You make a mistake on a prominent page and the CTO sees it? Well, guess you'll be adding an XHTML validator to your CI pipeline next week! It is very tempting to write a lenient parser when you are just one small fish in a big ecosystem, but over time it will inevitably lead to the degradation of that very ecosystem. You need some kind of standards body to publish a validating reference parser. And like it or not, Chrome is big enough that it can act as one for HTML. reply",

The gp (and their employer) wants to integrate the advertisement snippet -- even with broken XHTML -- because they receive money for it . The semantic data (\"advertiser's message\") is more important than the format (\"purity of perfect XHTML\"). Same incentives would  happen with a jobs listing website like Monster.com.   Consider that it currently has lots of red errors with incorrect HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.c... If there was a hypothetical browser that refused to load that Monster.com webpage full of errors because it's for the users' own good and the \"good of the ecosystem\"... the websurfers would perceive that web browser as user-hostile and would choose another browser that would be forgiving of those errors and just load the page .  Job hunters care more about the raw data of the actual job listings so they can get a paycheck rather than invalid <style> tags nested inside <div> tags. Those situations above are a different category (semantic_content-overrides-fileformatsyntax) than a developer trying to import a Python library with invalid syntax (fileformatsyntax-Is-The-Semantic_Content). EDIT reply to: >Make the advertisement block an iframe [...] If the advertiser delivers invalid XHTML code, only the advertisement won't render. You're proposing a \"technical solution\" to avoid errors  instead of a \"business solution\" to achieve a desired monetary objective.  To re-iterate, they want to render the invalid XHTML code so your idea to just not render it is the opposite of the goal. In other words, if rendering imperfect-HTML helps the business goal more than blanking out invalid XHTML in an iframe, that means HTML \"wins\" in the marketplace of ideas. reply",

          "text": "Nice list. Some thoughts: - I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place. - I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as \"serverless\". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions. - Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got \"x86\" and \"ARM\" and that's that for the next generation. - XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology. reply",

The reason it died was because Internet Explorer 6 didn’t support it, and that hung around for about a decade and a half. There was no way for XHTML to succeed given that situation.

I sent in a tongue‑in‑cheek entry, a batch file that used PKZIP to “compile” code into PKZIP.OBJ (instead of .ZIP) and then ZIP2EXE to “link” it into an EXE. The result was an executable that unzipped itself back into a source file. He was amused enough to mention it near the end of his column, though he noted it didn’t quite qualify for the contest since I hadn’t written PKZIP myself.<p>I found scans of his section on archive.org, including the issue where he announces the contest, but I couldn't find my particular contribution. I've narrowed it down to the eight issues listed above that are in the right time-frame.<p>If you have any of these issues (paper or PDF), could you please check Wilf’s section near the back and see if my submission is mentioned?<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request.

This is because of something called a \"collapse hit\" where two requests that occur at the same time and are identical (according to your cache key) get merged together into a single origin request. CloudFront isn't \"storing\" anything, but the effect is still that a user gets a copy of a response that was already returned to a different user. > https://stackoverflow.com/a/69455222 > If your app authenticates based on cookies or some other header, and that header isn't part of the cache key, it's possible for one user to get a response intended for a different user. To fix it you have to make sure any headers that affect the server response are in the cache key, even if the server always returns no-store. --- Though the AWS docs seem to imply that no-store is effective: > If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 and configure the origin to send Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-store, Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: max-age=0, or Cache-Control: s-maxage=0. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Develope... reply",

Based on docs and some of the concerns about this happening to someone else, I would probably start with the following: 1. Check who/what created those EC2s[0] using the console to query: eventSource:ec2.amazonaws.com eventName:RunInstances 2. Based on the userIdentity field, query the following actions. 3. Check if someone manually logged into Console (identity dependent) [1]: eventSource:signin.amazonaws.com userIdentity.type:[Root/IAMUser/AssumedRole/FederatedUser/AWSLambda] eventName:ConsoleLogin 4. Check if someone authenticated against Security Token Service (STS) [2]: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:GetSessionToken 5. Check if someone used a valid STS Session to AssumeRole: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:AssumeRole  userIdentity.arn (or other identifier) 6. Check for any new IAM Roles/Accounts made for persistence: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateUser OR eventName:DeleteUser) 7.  Check if any already vulnerable IAM Roles/Accounts modified to be more permissive [3]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateRole OR eventName:DeleteRole OR eventName:AttachRolePolicy OR eventName:DetachRolePolicy) 8. Check for any access keys made [4][5]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateAccessKey OR eventName:DeleteAccessKey) 9. Check if any production / persistent EC2s have had their IAMInstanceProfile changed, to allow for a backdoor using EC2 permissions from a webshell/backdoor they could have placed on your public facing infra. [6] etc. etc. But if you have had a compromise based on initial investigations, probably worth while getting professional support to do a thorough audit of your environment.

I wouldn't trust it with anything novel. In general, I think of it as a better kind of search. The knowledge available on the internet is enormous, and LLMs are pretty good at finding and synthesizing it relative to a prompt. But that's a different task than generating its own ideas.

So while I could admit LLMs they have their use, I want to consciously follow a path where human intelligence and well-being is of the utmost concern, and any attempt at creating intelligent machines is tantamount to blasphemy.

Those complaining about ai slop are almost certainly complaining about lack of prompt engineering skills. Let me also explain the proper evolution here. In 2021, you would go to stackoverflow, copy some of your code or ask a question and hopefully someone helped you sometime. Then you'd get the help and probably paste their code in. In 2024, you would go to AI, copy some of your code, ask a question and the AI responds quickly. The solution might be bad, buggy, and so you reprompt because your first prompt wasnt engineered well. You finally get good code and copy and paste. In 2025, why all this copy and paste? Why not use agentic where it does the copy and paste for you. It knows what to read, and what to do. Also 2025, what if you have AI also orchestrating 1 level higher and verifying that it itself is doing a good job. reply",

I’m at the founder stage of a project that’s not OSS yet, but the core idea is deeply human: I’m building a system that uses conversational AI to map how people think, not just what they say — and then connect people whose thought processes resonate (builders, creators, deep thinkers, even quiet geniuses who rarely get discovered). Not a social network, not a dating app — more like a cognitive matching layer where the right minds can finally find each other to collaborate, co-found, create, or simply be understood — maybe for the first time in their lives. I’m still assembling the founding team and looking for early technical collaborators who care about meaningful architecture, ethical design, and building with depth — not engagement hacking. If any of that sounds interesting, I’d love to chat casually, see if there’s resonance, and share more details. Let me know if you’re open to exploring it. reply",

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

Discord's telemetry was broken on my browser, and on failure they immediately retried. It didn't take many actions queued up on the site before my browser was initiating over 100RPS, on their behalf. 2. Target and eBay still flag my sessions as bot traffic (presumably because they don't recognize the user agent or because I use Linux or something). Target allows browsing their site for a few items before heavily rate-limiting me for a day or so, and eBay just resets my password a day or two after I log in, every single bloody time. The problem is that from time to time normal users will generate large traffic volumes, and if the bot owner uses many IPs then you're forced to use less reliable signals for that ban hammer (i.e., no single user will be near 700 RPS). reply",

Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

Granted, we have a separate team working on \"genAI stuff.\" We started converting virtual machines about 3 weeks ago and we've gotten through ~500 of about 3500 or so. Our grant based HPC environment is just moving back to bare metal. The VM conversion is just for ad-hoc HPC and then all of our general infrastructure. Some of our larger application servers (SAP Hana) are possibly staying on VMWare if SAP won't support them on Hyper-V. This summer sucked big time but we'll make it. reply",

HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV. But you're also insane expecting a small reseller of some small company to pull your chestnuts out of the fire. reply",

          "text": "I work for an MSP, mostly with small to medium companies. Licensing costs went up a ton when broadcom acquired vmware. They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize.

( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Hooks being 5 years old and being the predominant tool for certain tasks shows that the community only figured out how to solve a particular problem 5 years ago. Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver.

Secondly, I know something about autism, because I have a child with autism. Look at the comments in this thread.  A guy asked a question about vanilla JavaScript, a completely valid question on a site about comments upon programming links, and yet notice all the comments that are instead not about that. There are so many comments about writing React, which is not what this thread is about.  There are so many comments from people talking about themselves instead of actually about programming, much less anything about vanilla JavaScript.  There are also comments like yours that are instantly hostility towards anything about original code, a subject that you seem to find horrifying. Yes, this is incredibly autistic.  Some common traits of autism, among many more that each autistic person may or may not have: * low social intelligence, which in this context displays when developers are only thinking about themselves, what's easiest for them, and cannot think about anything else such as users or business owners * fragile ego, which in this context results in hostility at subjects that expose a developers shallow capabilities and results in false displays of high confidence to mask deeply felt insecurity I got tired of working with immature people who, in a technical capacity, could only do a little more that copy/paste template code and were otherwise generally hostile because of high insecurity.  I am now in a different line of work where I don't have babysit people. Writing original code or writing applications without a giant framework isn't challenging, but the subject certainly feels like the world is caving in for a great many people who call themselves seniors or engineers. reply",

Any complicated web app will always hit some kind of corner case where you need to bypass your framework and manipulate an element. For example, the spinner that you see on https://manage.onopti.com/ is disabled with a pure DOM call once WASM + Blazor is started up. That being said, as many other comments rightly point out, (for most projects,) if you work directly in the DOM you'll end up recreating what most frameworks do for you. It's really only \"worth it\" when you can strongly justify it: IE, if you're making a charting library that can handle thousands of datapoints, or a rich degree of interactivity that a usual business web site doesn't have.

But there are still some strategic vanilla JS/TS packages that come in handy, e.g. clipboard, mousetrap, file-saver, split.js. Web Components with Lit is kinda fun, though you'll have to deal with DOM shadow roots or disable them. I would challenge that using a framework leads to less security. In vanilla JS you've got to use something like dompurify religiously to avoid XSS bugs, and you're tempted by the shiny candy-like innerHTML attribute. reply",

          "text": "I've abandoned Next.js and React for Elixir / Phoenix. I am able to build a perfectly pleasant user experience with just a sprinkle of vanilla JS via Phoenix hooks. The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "They're probably using some features of LiveView; I'm not too familiar with how  HTMX works, but with LiveView you can define all of your logic and state handling on the _backend_, with page diffs pushed to the client over a websocket channel (all handled out of the box). It comes with some tradeoffs compared to fully client-side state, but it's a really comfortable paradigm to program in, especially if you're not from a frontend background, and really clicks with the wider Elixir/Erlang problem solving approach. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#handlin... Hooks let you do things like have your DOM update live, but then layer on some JS in response. For example you could define a custom `<chart>` component, which is inserted into the DOM with `data-points=[...]`, and have a hook then 'hydrate' it with e.g. a D3 or VegaLite plot. Since Phoenix/LiveView is handling the state, your JS needs only be concerned about that last-mile JS integration; no need to pair it with another virtual DOM / state management system. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#client-... reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in.

And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else.

The vendor lock-in on NextJS is certainly much more egregious than other frameworks. They have their own undocumented build flag to give different build outputs that Vercel uses vs the build outputs that are documented. Hosting nextjs on your infrastructure is not as simple as sticking it into a docker file as with most frameworks And I would also push back on the idea that every framework has vendor lock in. Remix was so focused on \"using the platform\" that it basically willed itself out of existence. It's no longer even a framework. Just part of the react-router library. I've also used Astro which is a framework of similar complexity and feature richness as Nextjs and certainly has no \"lock in\". At least as far as reply",

As a result, I would argue that the overlap between the skillset and work needed to build an app like Obsidian overlaps more with most web applications than most desktop and mobile applications. You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application. How to build a large front-end app on non-web technologies (Swift, C++/QT, C#, etc) is also an interesting question but I didn't understand that as being the topic of this conversation. reply",

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

The key is leaning into web platform APIs and modular architecture. Here’s how I approached it for www.lendcalculator.com, a browser-based financial tool with dozens of calculators and dynamic UI — all built without React, Vue, or Angular.\nHow to Build Large Apps Without a Framework\nUse native modules + ES6 classes Structure your app like a library: each feature (calculator, modal, form) is its own module. Import/export keeps things clean. Leverage Web Components (if needed) They’re part of the platform now — encapsulation, lifecycle hooks, and reusability without vendor lock-in. Use vanilla JS + CSS for UI With querySelector, addEventListener, and fetch, you can build surprisingly rich interfaces. CSS Grid and Flexbox handle layout beautifully. State management via custom stores or events You don’t need Redux — just use CustomEvent, localStorage, or a simple pub/sub pattern.\nRouting with History API Use pushState and popstate to manage navigation. Works great for SPAs. Build tools: Vite, ESBuild, or even just Rollup You can still bundle, minify, and hot-reload without a framework.

You have been conditioned to think frameworks are necessary. That’s not true. You can build anything without them and it would probably be better in many ways. Would you spend a ton of time? Yes. Would your code be harder to maintain? Yes. But it is absolutely doable and not as hard as you’d think reply",

          "text": "The reasons I avoid large frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and even jQuery is that they are aren't necessary.  They are code decoration that slows things down.  Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

          "text": "Currently a one-man side project: https://laboratory.love Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard. That seemed solvable. Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post: - 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!) - That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates) - 6 results published, 4 in progress The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift. Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along: https://laboratory.love reply",

          "text": "1. An example result is \" https://laboratory.love/product/117 \", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level? 2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will? 3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6? 4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them? 5.

          "text": "Thank you for your questions! 1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results. 2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists. 3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive. 4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data. 5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware. reply",

And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is  μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount? I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means. I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to \"About\" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is: >What makes a result 'concerning'?\nWe don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research. I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant. [0] - https://laboratory.love/product/118 reply",

At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called \"embalmed\". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas. By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention. reply",

          "text": "This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1].  Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands.  I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well.  I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand. Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site.  I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is.  They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4]. (edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.

I have considered creating specific ad-hoc campaign pages for folks with special interests and let them drive people to the page (like a more focused Kickstarter or GoFundMe with a lab on the back end).

This covers not just the chemical analysis but also product acquisition, shipping, and operational costs. Right now there is only about 10% margin left as breathing room.

The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy. https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better. https://github.com/scallyw4g/poof reply",

          "text": "I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology. For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be. Approximately $30 of culture media can produce >10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics. My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics! Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :) reply",

(And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive). Some things that would be cool - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels\n  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.\n  - Cheaper enzymes in general\n  - More options for -80 freezers\n  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.\n  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.\n  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.\n  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees. - Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios? reply",

My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each 1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run 2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper 3. Pichia pastoris expression ^ 4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China) 5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market 6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it. 7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China 8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things reply",

I have finished around 400 so far and I am now focusing on adding test cases, writing implementations in Python and C, and creating formal proofs in Lean. It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place. The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.

I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop.  Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm. These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself.\nC as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic.

          "text": "Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language.  Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals.  Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean.  Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative?  But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS. Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful.  His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort.  His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying: int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (less(a[++i], v)) ;\n           while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n       exch(a[i], a[r]);\n       return i;\n     } There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable \"l\", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style.  And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one.  But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial: • He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself. • He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices. • Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations.  In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight.  Of course the numerous It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item , exch , and less , but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher.  (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.) Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop: procedure quicksort(l, r: integer)\n      var v, t, i, j: integer;\n      begin\n      if r > l then\n        begin\n        v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r;\n        repeat\n          repeat i := i+1 until a[i] >= v;\n          repeat j := j-1 until a[j] <= v;\n          t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t;\n        until j <= i;\n        a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t;\n        quicksort(l, i-l);\n        quicksort(i+1, r)\n        end\n      end; From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement.  I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare. The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator: template <class Item>\n   int partition(Item a[], int l, int r)\n     { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r];\n       for (;;)\n         {\n           while (a[++i] < v) ;\n           while (v < a[--j]) if (j == l) break;\n           if (i >= j) break;\n           exch(a[i], a[j]);\n         }\n         exch(a[i], a[r]);\n         return i;\n      } He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways.  One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones.  Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index.  (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.)  From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable ( https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/ ), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits. My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21 .  I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard.  I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly.  In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking. reply",

Send important alerts to multiple SIEM servers. - Avoid sending \"noise\" events to syslog/SIEM to prevent alert fatigue. - Enable spooling and TLS TCP transport in the local syslog. - Enforce mandatory access controls such as SELinux or AppArmor.  Ensure all applications are fully enforced. - All applications, 3rd party libraries go through strict security review, change control. - No real time connections to 3rd party networks for dependencies.  Everything is local in the datacenter or Cloud account after being code and security reviewed. - Have a manifest per code deployment of all known checksums of all files.  Use an in house tool to periodically verify checksums and alert real time on anything that is unknown. - Run a tool to verify \"Full RELRO\", \"Stack Canary\", NX/Pax, \"PIE\" for all running daemons.  Force teams to recompile anything missing these settings. - Disable SSH multiplexing on bastion nodes and clients outside of development. Multiplexing empowers logless phishing - Do not allow direct access to production servers just because there is a VPN.  Require a highly logged jump host.  If that is too much friction for someone move them elsewhere. - Hire 3rd party code penetration testers to find \"all the things\".  Fix all the things. - Hire 3rd party penetration testers to find every real world weakness in the infrastructure.  Have them sit with members of every org.  Tell employees to volunteer anything they see as a weakness.  Fire any C-Level that objects to this.  Have buy-in from board members. - Perform extensive background checks on all FTE candidates and executives.  Limit access to contractors by default. - Perform extensive background checks on all 3rd party vendors.  Be ready to explain findings to customers, auditors, regulatory bodies, etc... - Restore an entire production environment from scratch using only backups and code in a staging environment.  Have volunteer customers that signed additional NDAs test the restoration.  Do this on a regular schedule and ensure a non-technical manager with the appropriate access can follow the instructions. - Perform chaos monkey testing killing random nodes, unplugging random things and ensure teams can either self-heal or be quickly remediated by novice engineers. - Encourage red-team penetration testers to break things in a production-like staging environment.  Have executives and board members make it clear there are no reprisals, no consequences for bringing up taboo topics around security due to in-house politics . - Require a top-down culture of treating everyone equally.  This includes treating executives that leave their laptop unlocked and unattended exactly the same as an FTE.

          "text": "Because Passkeys are considered more secure. They had a rough, confusing start but seem to be taking off. I don't know your level of technical knowledge, but Passkeys are essentially a key pair (public/private) that follows the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard, similar to how PGP, SSH keys, or even website SSL keys work. The difference here is the private key is stored in a Secure Enclave or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on your devices. The Secure Enclave/TPM are theoretically hardware-isolated so that even your OS can't directly access them (no DMA). Instead, you use a special authentication API to make the calls. Again, no direct memory access (unless an exploit is found. :-P) Normally, you use biometrics or a PIN to provide user verification to the Secure Enclave/TPM, which unlocks access. Here's how the flow works as I understand it: 1. You visit a website and try to login. 2. The server sends a randomized challenge string. 3. Your device's authenticator signs that challenge using the private key. 4. That signature gets sent back to the server. 5. The server verifies the signature using the public key it has on file. Why Passkeys are cool: - No shared secrets, so there's nothing on the server that's useful to steal. - They're phishing resistant, the browser or whatever ensures the origin matches before allowing auth. - No replay attacks because the server issues a new randomized challenge string every time. - No cred stuffing because each passkey is unique to the service it's generated for. This should all be correct to the best of my unexpert knowledge. reply",

In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

For me it's less about needing stimulation and more about managing the side effects of what I'm already using (coffee). If I could get the alertness without the jitters/anxiety, that'd be the win.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I'm looking for copies of these issues of <i>PC Plus</i> magazine please.<p>1991-Nov, 1992-Jan, 1992-Mar, 1992-Apr, 1992-Jun, 1992-Jul, 1992-Oct, 1993-Jan.<p>This was a popular PC magazine in the UK, and one of its highlights was Wilf’s Programmer Workshop, a regular column full of programming puzzles, challenges and reader submissions.<p>At one point, he ran a contest around quines (programs that output their own source). I sent in a tongue‑in‑cheek entry, a batch file that used PKZIP to “compile” code into PKZIP.OBJ (instead of .ZIP) and then ZIP2EXE to “link” it into an EXE. The result was an executable that unzipped itself back into a source file. He was amused enough to mention it near the end of his column, though he noted it didn’t quite qualify for the contest since I hadn’t written PKZIP myself.<p>I found scans of his section on archive.org, including the issue where he announces the contest, but I couldn't find my particular contribution. I've narrowed it down to the eight issues listed above that are in the right time-frame.<p>If you have any of these issues (paper or PDF), could you please check Wilf’s section near the back and see if my submission is mentioned?<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request.

This is because of something called a \"collapse hit\" where two requests that occur at the same time and are identical (according to your cache key) get merged together into a single origin request. CloudFront isn't \"storing\" anything, but the effect is still that a user gets a copy of a response that was already returned to a different user. > https://stackoverflow.com/a/69455222 > If your app authenticates based on cookies or some other header, and that header isn't part of the cache key, it's possible for one user to get a response intended for a different user. To fix it you have to make sure any headers that affect the server response are in the cache key, even if the server always returns no-store. --- Though the AWS docs seem to imply that no-store is effective: > If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 and configure the origin to send Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-store, Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: max-age=0, or Cache-Control: s-maxage=0. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Develope... reply",

          "text": "I'm officially off of AWS so don't have any consoles to check against, but back on  a laptop. Based on docs and some of the concerns about this happening to someone else, I would probably start with the following: 1. Check who/what created those EC2s[0] using the console to query: eventSource:ec2.amazonaws.com eventName:RunInstances 2. Based on the userIdentity field, query the following actions. 3. Check if someone manually logged into Console (identity dependent) [1]: eventSource:signin.amazonaws.com userIdentity.type:[Root/IAMUser/AssumedRole/FederatedUser/AWSLambda] eventName:ConsoleLogin 4. Check if someone authenticated against Security Token Service (STS) [2]: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:GetSessionToken 5. Check if someone used a valid STS Session to AssumeRole: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:AssumeRole  userIdentity.arn (or other identifier) 6. Check for any new IAM Roles/Accounts made for persistence: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateUser OR eventName:DeleteUser) 7.  Check if any already vulnerable IAM Roles/Accounts modified to be more permissive [3]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateRole OR eventName:DeleteRole OR eventName:AttachRolePolicy OR eventName:DetachRolePolicy) 8. Check for any access keys made [4][5]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateAccessKey OR eventName:DeleteAccessKey) 9. Check if any production / persistent EC2s have had their IAMInstanceProfile changed, to allow for a backdoor using EC2 permissions from a webshell/backdoor they could have placed on your public facing infra. [6] etc. etc. But if you have had a compromise based on initial investigations, probably worth while getting professional support to do a thorough audit of your environment.

          "text": "We've been a similar situation. One thing we considered doing is to give them bad data. It was pretty clear in our case that they were scraping our site to get our pricing data. Our master catalog had several million SKUs, priced dynamically based on availability, customer contracts, and other factors. And we tried to add some value to the product pages, with relevant recommendations for cross-sells, alternate choices, etc. This was pretty compute-intensive, and the volume of the scraping could amount to a DoS at times. Like, they could bury us in bursts of requests so quickly that our infrastructure couldn't spin up new virtual servers, and once we were buried, it was difficult to dig back out from under the load. We learned a lot during this period, including some very counterintuitive stuff about how some approaches to queuing and prioritizing that appeared sounded great on paper, actually could have unintended effects that made such situations worse. One strategy we talked about was that, rather than blocking the bad guys, we'd tag the incoming traffic. We couldn't do this perfect accuracy, but the inaccuracy was such that we could at least ensure that it wasn't affecting real customers (because we could always know when it was a real, logged-in user). We realized that we could at least cache the data in the borderline cases so we wouldn't have to recalculate (it was a particularly stupid bot that was attacking us, re-requesting the same stuff many times over); from that it was a small step to see that we could at the same time add a random fudge factor into any numbers, hoping to get to a state where the data did our attacker more harm than good. We wound up doing what the OP is now doing, working with CloudFlare to identify and mitigate \"attacks\" as rapidly as possible. But there's no doubt that it cost us a LOT, in terms of developer time, payments to CF, and customer dissatisfaction. By the way, this was all the more frustrating because we had circumstantial evidence that the attacker was a service contracted by one of our competitors. And if they'd come straight to us to talk about it, we'd have been much happier (and I think they would have been as well) to offer an API through which they could get the catalog data easily and in a way where we don't have to spend all the compute on the value-added stuff we were doing for humans. But of course they'd never come to us, or even admit it if asked, so we were stuck. And while this was going, there was also a case in the courts that was discussed many times here on HN. It was a question about blocking access to public sites, and the consensus here was something like \"if you're going to have a site on the web, then it's up to you to ensure that you can support any requests, and if you can't find a way to withstand DoS-level traffic, it's your own fault for having a bad design\". So it's interesting today to see that attitudes have changed. reply",

It didn't take many actions queued up on the site before my browser was initiating over 100RPS, on their behalf. 2. Target and eBay still flag my sessions as bot traffic (presumably because they don't recognize the user agent or because I use Linux or something). Target allows browsing their site for a few items before heavily rate-limiting me for a day or so, and eBay just resets my password a day or two after I log in, every single bloody time. The problem is that from time to time normal users will generate large traffic volumes, and if the bot owner uses many IPs then you're forced to use less reliable signals for that ban hammer (i.e., no single user will be near 700 RPS). reply",

          "text": "I had a similar problem back in 2018, though at a smaller scale. I wrote a quick-and-dirty program that reads the authoritative list of all AWS IP ranges from https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json (more about that URL at the blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ip-ranges-json/ ), and creates rules in Windows Firewall to simply block all of them.  Granted, it was a sledgehammer, but it worked well enough. Here's the README.md I wrote for the program, though I never got around to releasing the the code: https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=22eadf6c608448a98b6643606d1... It ran for some years as a scheduled task on a small handful of servers, but I'm not sure if it's still in use today or even works anymore.  If there's enough interest I might consider publishing the code (or sharing it with someone who wants to pick up the mantle).  Alternatively it wouldn't be hard for someone to recreate that effort.

OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source models via Replicate. Spend a week building something real: add a chatbot to your product, build a document Q&A system, whatever solves an actual problem.

          "text": "Our 5 year ELA for VMware went from 1.5M USD to 12M USD. I work in Higher ed. Our Hyper-V environment came online a few months ago. It was already included with our ELA with Microsoft so we were able to splash out a bit for some higher tier support. Granted, we have a separate team working on \"genAI stuff.\" We started converting virtual machines about 3 weeks ago and we've gotten through ~500 of about 3500 or so. Our grant based HPC environment is just moving back to bare metal. The VM conversion is just for ad-hoc HPC and then all of our general infrastructure. Some of our larger application servers (SAP Hana) are possibly staying on VMWare if SAP won't support them on Hyper-V. This summer sucked big time but we'll make it. reply",

          "text": "This is a hot topic among some of my nerdier SME friends, and our conclusion is that the major players are HPE and Nutanix. At least from our perspective over here in Sweden. HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV.

They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

          "text": "Check out libvirtd based stacks, because that's what's supported by upstream Linux. Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible. reply",

The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

          "text": "We're driving as many apps as possible to containers, and replacing most of our virtual infrastructure with Talos Linux [1] which is a reasonably  hardened OS dedicated to Kubernetes hosting.  I strongly recommend using the terraform provider to help manage at scale.  The docs seem  a little sparse for beginners, but if you already know kubernetes concepts, it's pretty easy to pick up.  If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize. They have to explain to the board why their spending increased and they are still on legacy. - [1] - https://www.talos.dev/ reply",

          "text": "I've seen a very broad spectrum of research code. In general research code translates O(1e1-1e2) lines of mathematics into O(1e3-1e4) lines of code. I find mathematics easier to understand than code, so that's going to color my opinion. My favorite research code tends to look like the mathematics it implements. And that's really hard to do well. You need to pick abstractions that are both efficient to compute and easy to modify as the underlying model changes. My favorite research code also does the reader a lot of favors (eg documents the shape of the data as it flows through the code, uses notation consistent with the writeup or standard conventions in the field). Industry research code... I'm happy to see basic things.  Version control (not a bunch of Jupyter notebooks). Code re-use (not copy+paste the same thing 20x). Separation of config and code (don't litter dozens of constants throughout thousands of lines of code). Functions < 1000 lines apiece. Meaningful variable names. Comments that link the theory to the code when the code has to be complicated. Overall it's probably most helpful to find a researcher in your field whose code you like to read, and copy the best aspects of that style. And ask readers of your code for feedback. I really enjoy reading Karpathy's code (not my field), but that may be an exception because a lot of what I've read is intended to teach a more or less codified approach, rather than act as a testbed for iteration in a more fluid design space. reply",

I'm building a new NAS but instead of using an off the shelf appropriate distro like TrueNAS I just installed NixOS and I'm having Claude Code fully manage the entire operating system. It's going pretty well so far. Initially it would reach for tools like dig that weren't available on the install but after a \"# memorize We're on NixOS, you need to try to do things the NixOS way first. Including temporarily installing tools via nix-shell to run individual commands.\" those issues went away and it's doing NixOS things. From a clean NixOS command line install, we've got containers and vms handled. Reverse proxy with cloudflare tunnels with all endpoints automatically getting and renewing SSL certs. All the *arr stack tools and other homelab stuff you'd expect. Split horizon DNS with unbound and pihole running internally. All of my configurations backed up in github. I didn't even create the cloudflare tunnels or the github repos. I had claude code handle that via API and cli tools. The last piece I'm waiting on to tie it all together are my actual data drives which should be here tomorrow. Is this a smart thing to do? Absolutely not. Tons of things could go wrong. But NixOS is fairly resilient and rollbacks are easy. I don't actually have anything running on the NAS in use yet and I've got my synology limping along until I finish building this replacement. It's still an open question whether I'll use Claude Code like this to manage the NAS once I've migrated my data and my family has switched over. But I've had a very good experience so far. reply",

No, your vibe-coding is not more productive, unless your only metrics for productivity are commit counts, PR counts, deployment counts. I can commit, PR and deploy crap all day long and \"score well\" - and this is what people are clinging to with their ai-gen defenses. I'm really sorry to inform you that your experienced \"speed-up\" is just a trick of the brain (remembering from an article written, iirc, by Gurwinder, but I'm having trouble finding it now) - you're actually going slower, and your brain is tricking you into thinking it's faster because whilst the ai was \"coding\", you didn't have to, so it feels like more of a win than it actually is, considering the results. reply",

The Curve is rather steep right now with the horizon changing to quickly.

Those complaining about ai slop are almost certainly complaining about lack of prompt engineering skills. Let me also explain the proper evolution here. In 2021, you would go to stackoverflow, copy some of your code or ask a question and hopefully someone helped you sometime. Then you'd get the help and probably paste their code in. In 2024, you would go to AI, copy some of your code, ask a question and the AI responds quickly. The solution might be bad, buggy, and so you reprompt because your first prompt wasnt engineered well. You finally get good code and copy and paste. In 2025, why all this copy and paste? Why not use agentic where it does the copy and paste for you. It knows what to read, and what to do. Also 2025, what if you have AI also orchestrating 1 level higher and verifying that it itself is doing a good job. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I had a mind-blown-moment when I learnt that Obsidian was built without any frontend JS framework. ( https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-framework-did-the-developer-use-to-create-obsidian-desktop-application/30724/11 )<p>The benefits, I can see.<p><pre><code>    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.\n\n    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.\n\n    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.\n\n    Because there is no \"abstraction layer\" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.\n\n    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.\n</code></pre>\nThere are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.<p>But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.<p>Thank you!</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And fwiw, the obsidian team seems to agree in principle. Your link goes to a forum post of some kind, in which one may find a link to obsidian's third party deps: https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgement... These do not include React, but do include: - i18next\n - lezer\n - moment.js Plus a bunch of others. Why didn't obsidian write their own date lib and chose to use moment.js? Because it saved them time, despite the fact that moment.js does make changes, and many people are moving on from it in any case. The idea that not using a frontend framework will let you focus on delivering features seems reductive, and the obsidian anecdote doesn't support the idea anyway. Whatever you're building, it's never a bad idea to deeply understand the tradeoffs that using a library will bring. Obsidian probably couldn't accept the downsides of React due to them needing a bunch of custom renderers for content, which React makes harder. But that is likely a rare constraint for apps in general. Generally speaking, libs like react exist to save you time and help you focus on delivering features. reply",

Hooks being 5 years old and being the predominant tool for certain tasks shows that the community only figured out how to solve a particular problem 5 years ago. Compare that, in terms of stability, to Python having coming up with the idea of packages a long time ago, and packages are now a stable part of the ecosystem (packag ing is another story which I'll get to shortly). Revamping the docs is not a problem by itself, but take a look at Python or Django, their docs have the same look and feel for older versions of the code. It's totally a minor problem, and if it were the only one I wouldn't be complaining here, but with the plethora of problems it starts to feel like death by a thousand papercuts. > Create-react-app was deprecated Going back to Python packaging, while it's much better than C/C++ packaging, people still love to complain about it! That said, pip is not deprecated. For React to just abandon the idea of helping users to create a project and telling them to \"go bother someone else about it\" does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. > If this is a bitch fest about React, then the react docs and CRA are fair game, but remix isn't IMO. It absolutely is a bitch fest about React because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React in the first place and it makes it so hard to do simple things without reinventing the wheel, but anyway, I'd say the ecosystem is fair game now that CRA is deprecated and the docs themselves tell you to go to Next or Vite or React Router or Tanstack. Anyway, the point is that while React might be relatively stable from the point of view of the larger javascript ecosystem, it's still way less stable than it should be and way less stable than browser APIs. reply",

Hooks being 5 years old and being the predominant tool for certain tasks shows that the community only figured out how to solve a particular problem 5 years ago. Hooks are ~~7~~ 6 years+8months old, almost 7 years. This may not seem like a significant difference, but IMO it puts them 75% of the way back in time to when react took off versus 50% of the way. That is a significant difference. Please stop repeating the 5 year number. It's _provably_ wrong and not a matter of opinion: https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.htm... > does not seems like something a stable ecosystem would do. I don't think being a 'stable ecosystem' means owning every part of the dev process, or even most of it; nor have they ever intended to do so (they didn't reimplement npm, webpack, etc). CRA existed to fill a particular need for a time (providing a simpler/more stable interface in front of webpack), and when that was no longer needed by the community, they abandoned it. I don't understand why this matters. Better tools emerged, the React docs/guidance reflect that. > because I inherited a simple site that should have never used React I'm sorry that you're in that situation. The React community is not really responsible for that IMO, and I don't think the things you've highlighted have meaningfully contributed to making that worse. I stand by the fact that deprecating CRA once great alternatives emerged was the right answer. Next is probably a good answer for many people too. The react team is and should be writing recommendations for the common case for their library, and the fact that your simple site falls outside of an ideal case for React doesn't mean they're not writing the correct recommendations. reply",

Since the whole project was migrated over from React, I was able to improve performance to a degree that would have been impossible using React, it's a breadth of fresh air to open the performance and memory tab and to be able to optimise things from there to get 60FPS no matter what whilst preventing massive ram usage because those frameworks runs all sort of code that is out of your control. Also because there is no build system, I was able to introduce plugins to be able to patch frontend code via patch applied dynamically by the server to create features like the recall button to recall data stored on glacier when using S3, dynamic patching of the icons to apply branding and many other things that I would have had to fork entirely before Anyway, I hope our industry would go more often the vanilla route, es6 is ready for prime time and solve all the pain point we had while internet explorer was still a thing reply",

          "text": "First, I decide if I think the app will have lots of client-side interaction. As a shorthand, the question is “Does my idea seem like a spreadsheet, Google Maps, or a video game with lots of interactive clicking?” If the answer to that question is “No”, then I’m not conceptualizing a SPA and don’t need a framework. If the answer is “Yes”, I’d ask where I think that interaction will manifest in the experience and if I can isolate it. If I am not looking at a SPA use-case, then my focus is on using vanilla HTML and Modern CSS with a tiny bit of javascript (as a scripting language versus as a programming language [1]). Then the remainder of the focus is on data modeling (CRUD), auth flows, and business logic development (what the application will do). Beyond vanilla HTML, Modern CSS, and a tiny amount of javascript, if I need further client-side interactivity, I would consider something like htmx. If I need interactivity beyond that, then we’re into SPA territory, but at this point the requirements and application have evolved to that point since we initially said we weren’t building that kind of thing. Overall, the idea is to progressively iterate on the application, keeping the architecture and dependencies reigned in and aligned with the core objectives. [1] JavaScript as scripting vs programming language: what I mean by this is JavaScript as a language with many warts is not so bad if its scope is kept small. I believe the issues with JavaScript arise when it is pushed to do too much. This then leads to needing to use Typescript as a matter of pragmatism. I aim to never get to the point of using so much JavaScript that I then need Typescript. I would say using it as a scripting language (to fill in gaps that Modern CSS and HTML cannot handle today) greatly minimizes the need for this progression. reply",

Edit: for a more practical example, you don't need to go down the web components rabbithole just for native reactive components, MutationObserver can watch for your template fragments entering and exiting the DOM and run your init/destruct routines on them. Now you can just push HTML back from the server with fetch or xmlhttprequest or whatever, and as soon as your component's HTML enters the DOM it will be \"hydrated\" by your init routine via MutationObserver. Honestly, add some event signaling and XHR and you're further along to a smooth SPA-like experience than you might think. reply",

There are also comments like yours that are instantly hostility towards anything about original code, a subject that you seem to find horrifying. Yes, this is incredibly autistic.  Some common traits of autism, among many more that each autistic person may or may not have: * low social intelligence, which in this context displays when developers are only thinking about themselves, what's easiest for them, and cannot think about anything else such as users or business owners * fragile ego, which in this context results in hostility at subjects that expose a developers shallow capabilities and results in false displays of high confidence to mask deeply felt insecurity I got tired of working with immature people who, in a technical capacity, could only do a little more that copy/paste template code and were otherwise generally hostile because of high insecurity.

I wrote a small internal mini-framework to follow the MVC pattern and Web Components for reusable elements. I also used external libraries: three.js for 3D rendering, sql.js for handling the 3d's models meta-data in a performant way, and @tanstack/virtual for virtualizing large lists and tables. The biggest benefit was finer control over performance. The main downside was a less comfortable developer experience — it’s harder to find polished, ready-made vanilla-JavaScript components, so you implement more yourself. reply",

Any complicated web app will always hit some kind of corner case where you need to bypass your framework and manipulate an element. For example, the spinner that you see on https://manage.onopti.com/ is disabled with a pure DOM call once WASM + Blazor is started up. That being said, as many other comments rightly point out, (for most projects,) if you work directly in the DOM you'll end up recreating what most frameworks do for you. It's really only \"worth it\" when you can strongly justify it: IE, if you're making a charting library that can handle thousands of datapoints, or a rich degree of interactivity that a usual business web site doesn't have. But for a typical interactive website: Use whatever framework your peers at your company will be comfortable with. reply",

The fact that I have been able to build a multi-user collaborative editor experience without a single additional dependency is incredible. I previously worked for a well-established and well-funded React team who had this feature on their roadmap for half a decade but still find it too daunting to implement. Phoenix was a great reminder that a lot of the \"frontend engineering\" we find ourselves doing as React developers just isn't necessary with the right backend. It's HORRIFIC to look back at all the yakshaving I've done in my career already. Wrangling types (GraphQL, codegen libraries), wrangling queries and data-fetching (react-query, SWR, server components), fiddling with middleware (serverless functions, getStaticProps, CDNs). I've seen teams outright abandon testing because the hours they invested just weren't catching any of the bugs that mattered. I'm not doing any of that anymore. I'm spending that time refining the core data model, improving test coverage, thinking about go-to-market and making money. Phoenix may not be a good choice if your product has reached that level of maturity and product-market fit where you really should care about \"microinteractions\", fine-tuned animations, or advanced use-cases for an SPA like offline support and highly-optimistic UI. But I would argue that even mature products don't truly need these things. Just look at the GitHub UI. I've spent a truly astronomical number of hours in that UI and never wished I had WYSIWYG text editing, or animated skeleton UIs, or the dozen other things that the React community tells us we need. reply",

          "text": "The big win for me has been the built-in PubSub primitives plus LiveView. Since the backend is already maintaining a WebSocket connection with every client, it's trivial to push updates. Here is an example. Imagine something like a multiplayer Google Forms editor that renders a list of drag-droppable cards. Below is a complete LiveView module that renders the cards, and subscribes to \"card was deleted\" and \"cards were reordered\" events. ``` defmodule MyApp.ProjectLive.Edit do\n    use MyApp, :live_view\n    import MyApp.Components.Editor.Card\n\n    def mount(%{\"project_id\" => id}, _session, socket) do\n      # Subscribe view to project events\n      Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, \"project:#{id}\")\n      project = MyApp.Projects.get_project(id)\n\n      socket =\n        socket\n        |> assign(:project, project)\n        |> assign(:cards_drag_handle_class, \"CARD_DRAG_HANDLE\")\n\n      {:ok, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :deleted, card_id}, socket) do\n      # handle project events matching signature: `{:cards, :deleted, payload}`\n      cards = Enum.reject(socket.assigns.project.cards, fn card -> card.id == card_id end)\n      project = %{socket.assigns.project | cards: cards}\n      socket = assign(socket, :project, project)\n      # LiveView will diff and re-render automatically\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def handle_info({:cards, :reordered, card_change_list}, socket) do\n      # omitted for brevity, same concept as above\n      {:noreply, socket}\n    end\n\n    def render(assigns) do\n      ~H\"\"\"\n      <div>\n        <h1>{@project.name}</h1>\n        <div\n          id=\"cards-drag-manager\"\n          phx-hook=\"DragDropMulti\"\n          data-handle-class-name={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          data-drop-event-name=\"reorder_cards\"\n          data-container-ids=\"cards-container\"\n        />\n        <div class=\"space-y-4\" id=\"cards-container\">\n          <.card\n            :for={card <- @project.cards}\n            card={card}\n            cards_drag_handle_class={@cards_drag_handle_class}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \"\"\"\n    end\n  end ``` What would this take in a React SPA? Well of course there are tons of great tools out there, like Cloud Firestore, Supabase Realtime, etc. But my app is just a vanilla postgres + phoenix monolith! And it's so much easier to test. Again, just using the built-in testing libraries. For rich drag-drop (with drop shadows, auto-scroll, etc.) I inlined DragulaJS[1] which is ~1000 lines of vanilla .js. As a React dev I might have been tempted to `npm install` something like `react-beautiful-dnd`, which is 6-10x larger, (and is, I just learned, now deprecated by the maintainers!!) The important question is, what have I sacrificed? The primary tradeoff is that the 'read your own writes' experience can feel sluggish if you are used to optimistic UI via React setState(). This is a hard one to stomach as a react dev. But Phoenix comes with GitHub-style viewport loading bars which is enough user enough feedback to be passable. p.s. guess what Supabase Realtime is using under the hood[2] ;-) [1] https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/ [2] https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/architecture reply",

          "text": "It depends on the target product. I'm working with JS for already 25 years. Tried all of the frameworks, and continue on doing it. And every time I try something new, the refactoring flow turns most of them into NextJS (if it's very UI rich or customer facing or something very web-oriented), or Vite+React+Tailwind (client) and Hono (backend) if it's more of a tinker toy needing more custom solutions. The boilerplate with NextJS is cleanest (compared to all the other frameworks) and API is the most straightforward one, and you can safely ignore the vendor lock in. Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. And Vite+React+Hono — simplest to set up for quick experiments, and very powerful with minimal boilerplate. Will probably create a starter for this one, as I have been using this stack quite a lot lately. EDIT: You can pretend vanilla JS is all you need, but then your app grows, then you suddenly need types, and state, and more events and their handlers, and SSR or something else.

Its just a pretext to hate on NextJS. They all have some kind of a \"vendor\" lock in. Be it a vendor-or-a-specific-approach-or-whatever-lock-in. The vendor lock-in on NextJS is certainly much more egregious than other frameworks. They have their own undocumented build flag to give different build outputs that Vercel uses vs the build outputs that are documented. Hosting nextjs on your infrastructure is not as simple as sticking it into a docker file as with most frameworks And I would also push back on the idea that every framework has vendor lock in. Remix was so focused on \"using the platform\" that it basically willed itself out of existence. It's no longer even a framework. Just part of the react-router library. I've also used Astro which is a framework of similar complexity and feature richness as Nextjs and certainly has no \"lock in\". At least as far as reply",

You're also correct that Electron provides APIs beyond those available in the browser, such as access to the native filesystem. The way I see it, those are mostly some lower-level details it wouldn't be that hard to run Obsidian in the browser, it's just a product choice not to (specifically, it would imply creating a file hosting service). As the Obsidian mobile app demonstrates, Electron is swappable and not needed for Obsidian's core functionality. In contrast, had Obsidian been built on React, it would be rather difficult to simply \"run without React\" without rewriting the entire application.

          "text": "Electron does not belong in the same category as React & Vue. JavaScript frameworks are commonly understood to mean: - Third-party libraries, almost always implemented in JS (technically it could be some language compiled to WASM but I'm not aware of any commonly used WASM framework) - Dynamically loaded from a CDN or bundled with application code at build time - Provide an high-level API for creating and updating UI - Whose implementation edits the DOM (a browser's low-level UI representation) In contrast, writing an app _without a UI framework_, therefore implies writing first-party JS code that interacts with DOM APIs directly, without that level of abstraction in-between. This is not a common choice these days, and could be considered an impressive accomplishment, hence this Ask HN. To create that UI, you use the same low-level DOM APIs in Electron as you would in the browser because well, it is a Chromium browser engine. Example of each combination: - Framework-using apps running in the browser: Airbnb, Figma - Frameworkless apps running in the browser: HN - Framework-using apps running in Electron: Figma's desktop app - Frameworkless apps running in Electron: Obsidian I wouldn't consider Electron as an answer to the question. It would be best described as a framework for running web apps as a standalone desktop app, but not a framework for creating user interfaces. Just using Electron doesn't make any progress towards having a solution for managing the complexity of writing code that interacts with the DOM. reply",

          "text": "You're spot on — building large frontend apps without a framework is totally viable, and Obsidian is a great example. The key is leaning into web platform APIs and modular architecture. Here’s how I approached it for www.lendcalculator.com, a browser-based financial tool with dozens of calculators and dynamic UI — all built without React, Vue, or Angular.\nHow to Build Large Apps Without a Framework\nUse native modules + ES6 classes Structure your app like a library: each feature (calculator, modal, form) is its own module. Import/export keeps things clean. Leverage Web Components (if needed) They’re part of the platform now — encapsulation, lifecycle hooks, and reusability without vendor lock-in. Use vanilla JS + CSS for UI With querySelector, addEventListener, and fetch, you can build surprisingly rich interfaces. CSS Grid and Flexbox handle layout beautifully. State management via custom stores or events You don’t need Redux — just use CustomEvent, localStorage, or a simple pub/sub pattern.\nRouting with History API Use pushState and popstate to manage navigation. Works great for SPAs. Build tools: Vite, ESBuild, or even just Rollup You can still bundle, minify, and hot-reload without a framework.

          "text": "The reasons I avoid large frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and even jQuery is that they are aren't necessary.  They are code decoration that slows things down.  Here is what you can expect without these: * greater flexibility * faster execution, My current application produces a large single page application that fully renders visually and executes state restoration in about 105ms localhost or under 200ms across a network * faster maintenance, I can do massive refactors that touch most files in the application in about 2 hours thanks to thorough use of TypeScript interface definitions --- Here is how I do it: 1. Just start building your application.  Realize that for any significant application the front end UI is probably only about 20% of the application code, or less. 2. Start the UI by writing static HTML.  Reserve JavaScript, in the browser, only for handling events and state restoration and execute state restoration only on page load. 3. I prefer to use WebSockets over HTTP as much as possible for absolutely everything I can get away with.  WebSockets are full-duplex, where HTTP is not, and have far less overhead.  That will substantially reduce the complexity around messaging in and out of the web browser. 4. Everything after that is just execution, planning, refactoring, and feature addition. 5. You can do absolutely all of it in TypeScript now without any compile step.  Node.js now executes TypeScript directly, but the browser does not.  To solve for the web browser just include the browser code into your Node application using ES6 module import.  If the imported code is a function you can convert it directly into a string for transport, and otherwise use JSON.stringify for objects/arrays. reply",

Don't create some shallow copy, cloned node, or other insanity.  You don't need any of that.  You don't need to litter your code, most especially your DOM nodes, with a bunch of business logic insanity. All you need is the event handler.  The event handler can be assigned to a node's event property directly, but if this is for a commercial site with lots of third party analytics/spyware you need to use a event listener instead because those third party libraries will overwrite your event assignments.  The event handler receives an event object as an argument with a reference back to the given DOM node. All the business logic should be stored in a single location representing a given business function, typically far away from the browser logic.  It makes sense when you write the code without using a framework.  If you write the code and try to make it look like a framework it will look like a framework, unsurprisingly.  If you don't do a bunch of framework component insanity it will not look like a framework. This is a person problem, not a technology problem. reply",

We were only quickly tipped off because they had to open a ticket to get the limit raised. If you haven't check newly made Roles as well. We quashed the compromised users pretty quickly (including my own, the origin we figured out), but got a little lucky because I just started cruising the Roles and killing anything less than a month old or with admin access. To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request. It is entirely possible whomever did your thing had you compromised for a bit, and then once AWS went down they decided that was the perfect time to attack, when you might not notice just-another-AWS-thing happening. reply",

This is because of something called a \"collapse hit\" where two requests that occur at the same time and are identical (according to your cache key) get merged together into a single origin request. CloudFront isn't \"storing\" anything, but the effect is still that a user gets a copy of a response that was already returned to a different user. > https://stackoverflow.com/a/69455222 > If your app authenticates based on cookies or some other header, and that header isn't part of the cache key, it's possible for one user to get a response intended for a different user. To fix it you have to make sure any headers that affect the server response are in the cache key, even if the server always returns no-store. --- Though the AWS docs seem to imply that no-store is effective: > If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 and configure the origin to send Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-store, Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: max-age=0, or Cache-Control: s-maxage=0. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Develope... reply",

Check who/what created those EC2s[0] using the console to query: eventSource:ec2.amazonaws.com eventName:RunInstances 2. Based on the userIdentity field, query the following actions. 3. Check if someone manually logged into Console (identity dependent) [1]: eventSource:signin.amazonaws.com userIdentity.type:[Root/IAMUser/AssumedRole/FederatedUser/AWSLambda] eventName:ConsoleLogin 4. Check if someone authenticated against Security Token Service (STS) [2]: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:GetSessionToken 5. Check if someone used a valid STS Session to AssumeRole: eventSource:sts.amazonaws.com eventName:AssumeRole  userIdentity.arn (or other identifier) 6. Check for any new IAM Roles/Accounts made for persistence: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateUser OR eventName:DeleteUser) 7.  Check if any already vulnerable IAM Roles/Accounts modified to be more permissive [3]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateRole OR eventName:DeleteRole OR eventName:AttachRolePolicy OR eventName:DetachRolePolicy) 8. Check for any access keys made [4][5]: eventSource:iam.amazonaws.com (eventName:CreateAccessKey OR eventName:DeleteAccessKey) 9. Check if any production / persistent EC2s have had their IAMInstanceProfile changed, to allow for a backdoor using EC2 permissions from a webshell/backdoor they could have placed on your public facing infra. [6] etc. etc. But if you have had a compromise based on initial investigations, probably worth while getting professional support to do a thorough audit of your environment.

In my opinion, it is somewhat problematic that different language concepts (Delphi, etc.) have been more or less merged into FP, resulting in redundant object models, for example. Pascal as a language also has various historical legacy issues (dangling else, block overhead, global namespace, etc.), which Wirth corrected in Modula and Oberon. The compiler is huge and apparently difficult to maintain (see e.g. https://github.com/rochus-keller/freepascal/ ). The resulting, optimized x86 code achieves about 70% of GCC compiled C code (see e.g. https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=64261.0 ), and it turned out that desctructors and some built-in data structures are extremely slow. So I went on to implement my own Pascal/Oberon descendant (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/micron/ , work in progress). reply",

And the great thing is they are resistent to phishing because certificates use mathematics and can not be fooled by wrong url in browser address bar.

          "text": "Because Passkeys are considered more secure. They had a rough, confusing start but seem to be taking off. I don't know your level of technical knowledge, but Passkeys  replace passwords by using public key cryptography instead of shared secrets (passwords). They consist of a key pair (public and private) and are based on the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard. Like other public key systems (PGP, SSH keys, or SSL certificates), the public key is shared while the private key remains secret. There are two main types of Passkeys: device-bound and synced . Both types are significantly more secure than passwords and resistant to phishing, but they have different trade-offs between security and convenience. Device-Bound Passkeys: With device-bound Passkeys, the private key is stored in a Secure Enclave or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on your device. The Secure Enclave and TPM are hardware-isolated, preventing even your operating system from directly accessing them. Instead, you use a special authentication API to make calls. There is no direct memory access to these keys unless an exploit is discovered. Think of a Secure Enclave and Trusted Platform Modules as a little, isolated computer inside your device -- because that's what they are! They have their own processor and operating system, and they are completely isolated from the rest of the device. They only release signatures and never release secrets (and aren't even capable of doing so, under normal cases). The device can only talk to the Secure Enclave/TPM via special authentication APIs. Synced Passkeys: Synced Passkeys store the private key in encrypted form within a password manager or platform keychain (like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or 1Password. These passkeys are designed to be backed up and synchronized across your devices for convenience. While the keys are encrypted during storage and transit, they're not permanently bound to a single hardware chip. This makes them more flexible and user-friendly, though they rely on the security of your account and the encryption used by the syncing service rather than hardware isolation. Here's how the flow works as I understand it: 1. You visit a website and try to login. 2. The server sends a randomized challenge string. 3. Your device's authenticator signs that challenge using the private key. 4. That signature gets sent back to the server. 5. The server verifies the signature using the public key it has on file. Why Passkeys are cool: - No shared secrets, so there's nothing on the server that's useful to steal. - They're phishing resistant, the browser or whatever ensures the origin matches before allowing auth. - No replay attacks because the server issues a new randomized challenge string every time. - No cred stuffing because each passkey is unique to the service it's generated for. This should all be correct to the best of my unexpert knowledge. --- Edit: Corrected some serious errors and forgot to explain device-bound vs. synced passkeys -- a major oversight! Disclaimer: Yes, I'm a human and I use --. This comment is self-written but I did use AI for grammar correction. reply",

For me it's less about needing stimulation and more about managing the side effects of what I'm already using (coffee). If I could get the alertness without the jitters/anxiety, that'd be the win.

It was already included with our ELA with Microsoft so we were able to splash out a bit for some higher tier support. Granted, we have a separate team working on \"genAI stuff.\" We started converting virtual machines about 3 weeks ago and we've gotten through ~500 of about 3500 or so. Our grant based HPC environment is just moving back to bare metal. The VM conversion is just for ad-hoc HPC and then all of our general infrastructure. Some of our larger application servers (SAP Hana) are possibly staying on VMWare if SAP won't support them on Hyper-V. This summer sucked big time but we'll make it. reply",

          "text": "This is a hot topic among some of my nerdier SME friends, and our conclusion is that the major players are HPE and Nutanix. At least from our perspective over here in Sweden. HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho. I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox. I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA. On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime. reply",

In general, if you are big, you're better off buying Premier from a partner, and declaring a crit sit. Many issues are fixable by less dumb third party L2 techs, and you can leverage the partner's juice with Microsoft to get somebody. You have the ability to inflict real pain on the reseller, but all Microsoft will do for a strategic customer is send some VP of something to apologize profusely at great length and suggest the more staff meet with your TAM/CSM so they can get a dramatic reading of a powerpoint. Companies like this only understand pain, so you need leverage. Microsoft is uniquely bad at this type of stuff. Anyone committing serious infrastructure where bad things are gonna happen when it goes down is insane for using HyperV. But you're also insane expecting a small reseller of some small company to pull your chestnuts out of the fire. reply",

We have done such a thing with backup restores from the Proxmox Backup Server. The patches are now in Proxmox VE 9.0 because the low hanging fruit problem was actually with the client code not the Proxmox Backup Server. reply",

          "text": "I work for an MSP, mostly with small to medium companies. Licensing costs went up a ton when broadcom acquired vmware. They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that. If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off. About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment. If you don't have a main office with a file server or some more demanding line of business apps this is a pretty easy move. A few are going to nutanix. Or more of expanding nutanix. reply",

Some shops here migrate to proxmox as a UI because of certification requirements, but I migrated some of my customers to cockpit dashboard, and some to kubernetes. It's always a matter of scale and provisioning requirements. Cockpit is my favorite so far because it's easy to setup, but its focus isn't cluster scale, which is what most larger companies need. You have to setup basically two cockpit variants: the webui and lots of cockpit server daemons (aka libvirtd on remote machines). The webui then uses SSH to login to other machines to manage them (e.g. via the known_hosts file on the webui server). [3] Proxmox is pretty old and Perl, but it's doable. Usually storage clustering is a bit painful because you need something on a filesystem layer like ceph clusters. There's also openshift but no idea if that is an IBM/RedHat lock-in as well, so the SMEs didn't want that risk.

The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible. reply",

          "text": "At PriorCo, I did a slide deck presentation of our options at the time (2023/2024) and pitched essentially three pathways: stay on VMware, move to Apache Cloudstack, or move to Nutanix. The deck was roundly ignored in favor of a lift-and-shift to AWS for remaining infrastructure. If I were running the migration, my preferred pathway would’ve been to Apache Cloudstack. We had the expertise to pull it off, and it would’ve freed us from vendor partners. Nutanix was really only on the list purely from its technology portfolio; its lack of profitability and shifting towards SaaS for features like cost analysis meant that we’d be moving into a similarly bad situation as VMware at the time (wholly beholden to their business priorities instead of our own), which I didn’t care for. There’s a lot of options out there, most of which are built atop either KVM/QEMU or OpenStack. Virtuozzo’s offerings impressed me, but the lack of a “comprehensive” product was a turnoff. Oxide was incredibly interesting from a simplicity and integration perspective, but the appetite wasn’t there to try a startup’s product. Microsoft and Oracle were both ruled out due to higher costs and more onerous licensing than VMware/Broadcom, while IBM/OpenShift were ruled out as our private cloud estate was 100% VMs with only ~20% of our internal products capable of containerization support. The biggest advice I can give is to understand your workload today, and determine options accordingly. Everyone’s pitching K8s and containers, but if your estate is majority VMs, then a lot of those options just aren’t worthwhile. reply",

If you know flux style gitups talhelper+sops is far better than naked talosctl.   We're also trying to migrate off of IAAS provided kubernetes and migrate to talos within instances.  It's an effort to reduce dependency on specific IAAS while also minimizing number of technologies we need to support. We're driving anything that cannot be containerized to lift and shift to IAAS and forcing the app owners to pay for it out of their budget as motivation to modernize.

Can I use this device and protect myself fully from it?<p>They provide the source code for the client side. SO that's fine, I can read that code, recompile it, and convince myself it is fully safe (I am only human, but let's assume it's good enough).<p>I have strong doubts about the firmware side though. I am not familiar with the hardware side, but could there be any security issue there?<p>The guys making the device are claiming [\"there is no firmware code\"](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM-USB/issues/5#issuecomment-2785035753). I do not understand that statement. Can anyone more knowledgeable shed some light as to what that means, and how I could verify it?<p>They point to a link to corroborate that claim, but the link is broken.<p>Thanks in advance for any insights!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I've seen a very broad spectrum of research code. In general research code translates O(1e1-1e2) lines of mathematics into O(1e3-1e4) lines of code. I find mathematics easier to understand than code, so that's going to color my opinion. My favorite research code tends to look like the mathematics it implements. And that's really hard to do well. You need to pick abstractions that are both efficient to compute and easy to modify as the underlying model changes. My favorite research code also does the reader a lot of favors (eg documents the shape of the data as it flows through the code, uses notation consistent with the writeup or standard conventions in the field). Industry research code... I'm happy to see basic things.  Version control (not a bunch of Jupyter notebooks). Code re-use (not copy+paste the same thing 20x). Separation of config and code (don't litter dozens of constants throughout thousands of lines of code). Functions < 1000 lines apiece. Meaningful variable names. Comments that link the theory to the code when the code has to be complicated. Overall it's probably most helpful to find a researcher in your field whose code you like to read, and copy the best aspects of that style. And ask readers of your code for feedback. I really enjoy reading Karpathy's code (not my field), but that may be an exception because a lot of what I've read is intended to teach a more or less codified approach, rather than act as a testbed for iteration in a more fluid design space. reply",

In 2024, you would go to AI, copy some of your code, ask a question and the AI responds quickly. The solution might be bad, buggy, and so you reprompt because your first prompt wasnt engineered well. You finally get good code and copy and paste. In 2025, why all this copy and paste? Why not use agentic where it does the copy and paste for you. It knows what to read, and what to do.

          "text": "Just started a Claude Code experiment this week. I'm building a new NAS but instead of using an off the shelf appropriate distro like TrueNAS I just installed NixOS and I'm having Claude Code fully manage the entire operating system. It's going pretty well so far. Initially it would reach for tools like dig that weren't available on the install but after a \"# memorize We're on NixOS, you need to try to do things the NixOS way first. Including temporarily installing tools via nix-shell to run individual commands.\" those issues went away and it's doing NixOS things. From a clean NixOS command line install, we've got containers and vms handled. Reverse proxy with cloudflare tunnels with all endpoints automatically getting and renewing SSL certs. All the *arr stack tools and other homelab stuff you'd expect. Split horizon DNS with unbound and pihole running internally. All of my configurations backed up in github. I didn't even create the cloudflare tunnels or the github repos. I had claude code handle that via API and cli tools. The last piece I'm waiting on to tie it all together are my actual data drives which should be here tomorrow. Is this a smart thing to do? Absolutely not. Tons of things could go wrong. But NixOS is fairly resilient and rollbacks are easy. I don't actually have anything running on the NAS in use yet and I've got my synology limping along until I finish building this replacement. It's still an open question whether I'll use Claude Code like this to manage the NAS once I've migrated my data and my family has switched over. But I've had a very good experience so far. reply",

I’m at the founder stage of a project that’s not OSS yet, but the core idea is deeply human: I’m building a system that uses conversational AI to map how people think, not just what they say — and then connect people whose thought processes resonate (builders, creators, deep thinkers, even quiet geniuses who rarely get discovered). Not a social network, not a dating app — more like a cognitive matching layer where the right minds can finally find each other to collaborate, co-found, create, or simply be understood — maybe for the first time in their lives. I’m still assembling the founding team and looking for early technical collaborators who care about meaningful architecture, ethical design, and building with depth — not engagement hacking. If any of that sounds interesting, I’d love to chat casually, see if there’s resonance, and share more details. Let me know if you’re open to exploring it. reply",
