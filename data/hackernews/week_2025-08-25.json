Just about the only thing I get from reading other people's code is the most egregious ways to not do something. This is a pretty common thing, a plurality of humans learn this way. We just have different standards for software, for some reason. We like to pretend books teach you something more \"real\" than just getting your hands dirty and writing some real fucked up code.

          "text": "The term \"design\" is ambiguous here. When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

          "text": "This has 2 key things: * \"well designed\": What was the objectives and ideas... * \"codebases\": How well that was implemented They are a lot of lofty claims saying how this or that is \"fast, secure, etc\" but don't end like that in the actual implementation. But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

          "text": "That would be quite clever for an incredibly horrible website. The other day my SO, who is a Turkish citizen, was filling up her visa application and after half an hour of meticulous form filling the system just kick her out. I think the session times out or something. If you haven't created an account or you haven't write down the current application ID everything is lost. In the process she was also directed to a non-.gov website for something during the process, I thought she was getting scammed but no. It actually makes sense to have a paid service that makes this abomination less painful. Though they work with VFS Global for collecting the applications and relevant documents, the VFS Global itself is an abomination and doesn't help with the handling of the form filling anyway. Recently EU streamlined the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens as those \"visa agencies\" that are the official agencies and the only way to apply for a visa for many countries don't actually help with anything and are scamming people by selling the \"good hours\" for the visa appointment on the black market. An agency was dropped for this and the scams by agencies were listed among the reasons to streamline the application process. Both with US and EU people are losing scholarships etc. due to outrageous wait times that are sometimes are years ahead or there's an issue with the systems handling the applications. I guess there must be an opportunity there to fix all this together with smaller stuff like handling transliteration and character encodings, I wonder if some of those scam site are not scams and actually help with it. An AI agent  can be useful here. reply",

I'll approximate the throttle by limiting chrome to 128kbps, 500ms delay, and 5% packet loss for fun. With a fresh incognito session, google responds to \"here to 4th street\" in 10 seconds, and when I click to open maps it needs just under two minutes to load.  Then I can click on the transit option and it needs another 10 seconds to update. Not too bad for a cold cache.  If I do it again with a hot cache it only takes 20 seconds to go through the whole process.  And I expect the app to be similar to the hot cache situation.  Even with 64kbps I'd expect reasonable results.  Do any cell providers throttle worse than that? I agree with your argument about bloat in general, but google in particular has a lot of good engineering resources and tries to work well on bad connections. Also I would be in favor of some spectrum licensing rules that say you can't throttle below 1Mbps... reply",

This is common.  Work begins on some web sites immediately after the election. For example, when a new president is sworn in, the White House web site flips immediately. More to the parent poster's point, it has been widely reported in the legitimate media repeatedly that many federal web sites have been replaced or significantly altered by the current administration.  There's an entire pseudo-department for it that also makes headlines for its greater transgressions. Add to that severe and sudden budget and staffing cuts, and like all government functions -- you get what you pay for. reply",

          "text": "Hi, about the Schengen visa situation in Turkey you can find articles like these that describe how the appointments are on the black market(In Turkish but I'm sure AI will do good job translating): https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5r2l43kn2o https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/22/vize-sorunu-kontrolden-cikt... On the social media the anecdotes differ but some say they were able to get the visa appointments bots, others say it was agency personel selling it to them under the table. Maybe its really the agency personel, or maybe it's people running bots to snap appointments and sell those pretending to be from the agency - can't know for sure but there are multiple services where people purchase appointments unofficially. In general the news situation in Turkey isn't very good as with the law enforcement but as you can see even BBC took notice. Generally speaking, these visa agencies are very unfriendly and unreachable. They seem to just collect the money, provide no personalized help at all. My GF had some questions about her US visa application, we were not able to reach VFS Global.  The phone numbers provided don't work, it's not even like taking long to speak with a human, the phone just gives you calling error. She previously used the same company for her Schengen visa for a company event in Paris, of course unreachable again and no appointments available. Because she works at a French corporation, she was able to ask a high ranking French person in the company who has a contact with the French embassy and they arranged the appointment shortly. reply",

Besides that, EU has \"green passport\" exception for the Turkish nationals, where they can travel visa-free on this kind of passport that is provided to individuals that meet certain criteria and millions of such passports were issued. The rejection rates are also not bad and EU has a \"return agreement\" with Turkey, which is designed to keep the middle eastern refugees in Turkey(essentially, if you come from Turkey EU can send you back to Turkey right away ).

To a first approximation, nobody who needs 500 servers is interested in 500 old servers and if they were they already bought 500 servers or are waiting for a better deal or aren’t ready to move out their 500 servers to make room. Recyclers have the real estate to receive 500 servers and experience disposing 500 servers. And there are not 500 hobbyists lined up…and who wants to deal with misinformed consumers? There are all sorts of incompatibility nuances with complex computer hardware. ——- Advice: If your hobby is gonna be training models, just build a box.

We don’t need to provoke just to indulge our worst instincts, but we also need tolerance for expressions that aren’t perfectly curated. That said, my article isn’t really about political correctness.

But you were also chastised for saying “you guys” -\n even though the women said as much as the men, if you didn’t put the proper pronouns under your profile.  I got chastised for saying “war room”.  I heard an anecdote that now “pow wow” wasn’t allowed. One podcast I listen to - Stuff You Should Know - replayed an old episode and added a disclaimer up front apologizing  because the episode was about pregnancy complications and in the older episode they were being “heteronormative” by not calling out that this issue only affects cisgendered women. I’m not saying anyone should be disrespected or I wouldn’t call someone by whatever name or pronoun they prefer. I also found all of the “ally” groups, discussion of “micro aggressions” etc groan worthy. This is in the DNCs charter https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-gender-non... > The language now says committees “shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1).”\nGender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, “and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided.” Yes I would find this just as bad if the language was about race and someone of mixed race heritage. I would much rather hang out with good live and let live traditional “guns and church family centered” old school Hank Hill conservatives (even though I’m not one), than the posturing “anti-racist” leftist wing. reply",

Nobody felt “silenced” by avoiding harmful words.\nThen came the hyperboles and the rigid rules you describe. To me, these are very similar to the poor-quality AI filters I discuss in my article: they judge without context. But judging requires more than scanning words—it requires understanding how, why, when, and under what circumstances something is said.\nWhat you’ve experienced—and thank you for sharing—is the result of bad, simplistic policy created by people who haven’t truly tried to understand or adapt. Human beings, societies, even nature itself, are complex systems. They can’t be reduced to mechanical yes/no rules.\nThat’s the heart of my article. And what I truly believe—as an eternal optimist—is that we can get to a place of smarter filters and smarter ways to coexist. It will take time, patience, and sincere effort.

When I need to find something, I do the same. I only use Google with queries for \"site:reddit.com\" or \"site:news.ycombinator.com\" to get opinions of real people on a particular manner. Now, before you jump on me saying that AI is wrong, this is true. But at the same time, I no longer can be 100% sure that whatever SEO optimized website I land at provides accurate information. If I need solid facts, I usually double check AI with various other sources. For queries like \"best keyboard for software engineers\", I'd rather get a table with pros/cons from AI rather than landing on whatever affiliate related website is promoted on Google. LLM gives me a good starting point to either dig deeper into particular products, or query further to find more suggestions. Same for coding. I used to Google \"how to split a string in ruby\" and land on flame war, or 19 years old, StackOverflow question. Now I can get an updated answer from whatever LLM you prefer with a reference to the official documentation. It works for simple queries, as well as code snippets. Lastly, I use LLMs to plan trips or gift ideas. I'd just throw in my preferences, and let LLM build a rough plan, from which I can iterate further, or start doing my own research. reply",

Letting the LLM handle the boilerplate and framework jargon lets me focus on the business logic and the design patterns, and helps me contribute much faster. But LLMs do often make mistakes so it's not like I blindly trust the output. They don't replace your colleagues in terms of being the ultimate source of truth.

For example, using tailwind, I can just describe in english what I want to happen with page elements and for the most part AI gets the code right, sometimes its wrong and I need to debug. A common argument I hear about AI is \"I could just write it faster myself\", well I know CompSci and general info about a lot of software things but it would take hours of getting up to speed on areas I'm not an expert in to be productive. I can just delegate that to AI and get mostly correct outputs, this is okay with me and faster than what I could do. I think the cost is going to catch up with the AI companies running the models (not the companies building products that call AI APIs) and that is when the bubble will burst. They will need to keep increasing costs and at some threshold, fewer and fewer developers in an organization will have licenses because it may become unaffordable. reply",

It’s best when the deal is a known quantity vs looking over “who’s hiring monthly HN posts”. I had 10-15 people i was working with (not all employed) at my last startup and they all came through my network either directly (ex colleagues) or through trusted parties. Again it’s mostly a trust thing more than anything. I think a good strategy is to get close to the kind of startups you care about without (before) direct intent to join. It’s easy to hang out (or at least it used to be) through various events, meetups or co-working places. Many startups I didn’t join and could have been good, I’ve met through open-source (Hadoop, HBase, Mesos, etc.) these are companies like Cloudera, DataBricks etc. when they were tiny. I still miss that crowd, years later. So it’s mostly a matter of being close to what’s happening, able to filter and ready to jump when opportunity arises. reply",

          "text": "1. Twitter: Founders and employees of early stage startups are often on twitter. 2. Portfolios of great angel investors and VC firms. 3. Emailing people you admire, eg investors, founders, or engineers. 4. Write down your friends and past and current colleagues who you think are a) most likely to be successful and b) you’d most enjoy working with. Or even just who you most like, trust, and admire. Then see where they work. And ask them about other companies they know. The simplest version of this is go on LinkedIn, and browse your network, and click to check out the companies all of your past classmates and colleagues work at. 5. Go to events that would have interesting technologists in your field (ie the areas where you have skill and taste, so you can pick who you admire), and ask them where they work, and which startups they’ve been impressed by. Talks, conferences, meetups, maker spaces. 6. Biased self-promotion: I’m kind of obsessed with interesting startups and sometimes share lists of startups, eg https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957834156794343730 and https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957446016950816866 7. HN who is hiring thread: there are lots of interesting ones there, you’ll just want to dig through to find them. 8. Look up university career fair company lists to see which companies are hiring, if they’re hiring new grads and interns then they’re very likely hiring senior engineers too. 9. Podcasts: some technologists have great podcasts, so do some investors and VC firms. 10. Search for startups founded by alumni from your school, you’re more likely to have alumni second degree connections there. I’ll note that investors get many bets, employees get one at a time. So you need a higher bar. Meeting in person is particularly high signal. My tip for filtering companies is to spend as much time as possible in person with the team before accepting an offer, ideally at least on 3+ separate occasions, with 3+ separate people. If there’s doubt, skip. This is also why it’s so good to start by identifying your most impressive friends and colleagues and see where they work, because you start with that high trust filter. reply",

          "text": "It’s a technique that will favor those skilled in BS — or more charitably, those skilled in social persuasion. And this is a risk for the founders, but there are plenty of cracked engineers who are also persuasive. The problem is they have little motivation to join a company with instability and looming uncertainty. So if the founders aren’t careful they’ll end up hiring someone more skilled at BS than any technical competency. I’ve been the founder in this position, and I’m confident in my ability to judge talent, so I don’t worry too much about the risk of hiring a BSer. I know that if I want to hire someone then they’re qualified. But at what price? Once I’ve decided I want to hire them, the cost of passing — and restarting the cycle — is too high to push back on high counteroffers, especially when the investors are pressuring us to hire fast. (fwiw, my next startup I will avoid raising any money until we have product/market fit… or at least I’ll tell the VCs pressuring me to hire too early to pound sand… this rushed hiring was a big contributor to the soft failure (acquihire), but I am proud we built a very strong team. For all our missteps and failures, hiring was not one of them.) reply",

          "text": "If you look at a lot of products out there that are basically what people want Siri to be (a truly integrated AI assistant), they either fall super flat (see rabbit r1) or are prohibitively expensive (see motion ai). Additionally, I think another one people forget is that Apple positioned itself with their marketing as the last bastion of privacy (I'm emphasizing marketing, not reality here), which gets contradicted with AI's current public perception. There's also the issue of choosing whether to keep things in the cloud or on device. One final major thing that I think Apple is considering: how could AI integration inadvertently cannibalize their app store profits?  If they're able to offer AI integration that other calendar, todo, etc. apps can't, how will that affect a user's purchasing decision?  If doing this would potentially eat into app store profits, then the next logical step is to create a system that allows developers to essentially have an API into the user's trained data, which is likely no small feat, especially if Apple is trying to obscure the data exposed to the app developer. reply",

Do they _want_ people using Siri?  Yes, it is actually a valuable feature for me to be able to get directions while driving or play a song while cooking.  Everything else has a weird cost-benefit ratio to Apple I imagine.  The things that make you think the iPhone is substantively more valuable because Siri can do them are hard.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It's the weekend. Let's do some brainstorming. What's forefront on your mind with regards to the human predicament, and how we move forward? \nWe all see that it seems pretty much everyone has gone insane, or at least that's what the narrative portrays. Why are companies, governments, and other organizations doing such stupid things? \nSo we've made machines that can appear to \"think\", by articulating linguistic constructs that make sense. In fact, there appears to be actual semantic and logical structure embedded within the neural networks of LLMs. Ok, let's keep our heads on straight, keep in mind the mathematics involved, chill out, and just think about what it is that we actually want (and what \"we\" are, for that matter). Are we going to someday transcend language? I'm aware that I'm typing this message out to you, using language, with hopes that this form of communication will become obsolete. But what will that look like? I know that human language in it's current form is severely limited. \nIf we're to design some future communication protocol and methodology, let's contemplate what types of things even need to be communicated? For example, what is \"the news\" nowadays? Could it be simply a video stream of the sunrise? Well it would take a long time to get there. In the meantime, it should probably be something like \"yeah, it's another day, and humans are doing the work necessary to put order to chaos and make things better for everyone\".<p>From a more concrete perspective, I'd say that we've reached the point when we can transcend the idea of what \"work\" is currently. We can see beyond the limited view of doing things for monetary profit, and see that certain systems could be implemented much better if there were certain forms of entity-organization and resource-allocation at play. What is a company if it's ran by a computer? What does it serve? I mean, it sounds silly to suggest some big companies with overlapping domains of operation should consolidate their operations, but we all know that that's where things should be headed in many cases.<p>So yeah, what's your vision for the future?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "My vision for the future includes greatly reducing the power requirements for AI by rethinking computing using first principles thinking. Every single attempt at this so far wasn't willing to go far enough, and ditch the CPU or RAM.  FPGAs got close, but they went insane with switching fabrics and special logic blocks. Now they've added RAM, which is just wrong. Edit/Append: I've had this idea [1] forever (since the 1990s, possibly earlier... don't have notes going that far back).  Imagine the simplest possible compute element, the look up table... arranged in a grid.  Architectural optimizations I've pondered over time lead me to a 4 bits in, 4 bits out look up table, with latches on all outputs and a clock signal. This prevents race conditions by slowing things down. The gain is that you can now just clock a vast 2d array of these cells with a 2 phase clock (like the colors on a chessboard) and it's a universal computer, Turing complete, but you can actually think about it without your brain melting down. The problem (for me) has always been programming it and getting a chip made.  Thanks to the latest \"vibe coding\" stuff, I've gotten out of analysis paralysis, and have some things cooking on the software front.  The other part is addressed by TinyTapeout, so I'll be able to get a very small chip made for a few hundred dollars. Because the cells are only connected to neighbors, the runs are all short, low capacitance, and thus you can really, REALLY crank up the clock rates, or save a lot of power. Because the grid is uniform, you wont have the hours or days long \"routing\" problems that you have with FPGAs. If my estimates are right, it will cut the power requirements for LLM computing by 95%.

On the superintelligence front, focusing on empathetic LLMs for companionship taps into real societal issues like rising loneliness (e.g. reports from the WHO highlight it as a global health threat).\nThis approach risks exacerbating dependency rather than alleviating it, potentially creating echo chambers of artificial interaction over genuine human bonds.

Honestly, I consider those two pretty different questions. At the very least, I'd approach them very differently in terms of time-scale. What's \"top of mind\" for me is more about the short-term threats I perceive to our way of life, whereas my \"vision for the future\" is - to my way of thinking - more about how I'd like things to be in some indeterminate future (that might never arrive, or might arrive long after my passing). To the first question then: what's on my mind? 1. The rise of authoritarianism and right-wing populism, both in the US and across the world. 2. The increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence systems, and the specter of continued advances exacerbating existing problems of unequal wealth / power imbalances / injustice / etc. Combine (1) and (2) and you have quite a toxic stew on your hands in the worst case. Now I'm not necessarily predicting the worst case, but I wouldn't bet money that I couldn't afford to lose against it either. So worst case, we wind up in a prototypical cyberpunk dystopia, or something close to it. Only probably less pleasant than the dystopias we are familiar with from fiction. And even if we don't wind up in a straight up \"cyberpunk dystopia\", one has to wonder what's going to happen if fears of AI replacing large numbers of white-collar jobs come true. And note that that doesn't have to happen tomorrow, or next year, or 5 years from now or whatever. If it happens 15 years, or 25 year, or 50 years, or whatever, from now, the impact could still be profound. So even for those of you who are dismissive of the capabilities of current AI systems, I encourage you to think about the big picture and play some mental simulations with different rates of change and different time scales. reply",

Backing out of setup on every startup is possible --- but it is often a multi-step process that becomes extremely annoying.

Smart TVs are actually cheaper --- which make no sense until you realize they are counting on recurring revenue from privacy invasion. They try to strong arm you into connecting the TV to the internet --- unless you run the TV in store demo mode. Also, the picture quality on lower ends models differ from the more expensive ones primarily because their bightness, contrast and color saturation controls are artificially limited --- except when run in store demo mode. So my solution is to buy a low end smart TV and run it in demo/store mode without connecting it to the internet. Whereupon, it it will act just like a dumb TV with the brightness and contrast jacked up to simulate the more expensive models. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

I've got years of random side projects and pretty much every photo I've taken going back many years. It's a complete mess, with various duplications, it's just not that big (few hundred GB maybe? I'm away from home so can't open up my NAS and look) so not worth my time to optimize it. On the flip side it's fun to randomly browse through and take a trip down memory lane. When there's a particular thing I definitely want can be more of a pain to find than if I had any decent organization but that comes up rarely enough that I don't really care. reply",

          "text": "Three things that have bitten me recently: 1. beware of encryption, especially Microsoft and Apple. I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

(it's in the 'Framework Desktop', for example, but not in their laptop lineup yet) AMD/Intel hasn't surpassed Apple yet (there's no answer for the M4 Max / M3 Ultra, without exploding the energy use on the AMD/Intel side), but AMD does at least have a comparable and competitive offering. reply",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon. Apple Silicon optimizes for idle states and x86 optimizes for throughput, which assumes very different use cases. One of the challenges for using x86 in laptops is that the microarchitectures are server-optimized at their heart. ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial.

Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article.

The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

It also requires highly competent operating system developers focusing on the issue for a very long time, and being able to co-design the operating system, firmware and hardware together.

To be fair, usually the linux itself has hardware acceleration available but the browser vendors tend to disable gpu rendering except on controlled/known perfectly working combinations of OS/Hardware/Drivers and they have much less testing in Linux. In most case you can force enabling gpu rendering in about:config and try it out yourself and leave it unless you get recurring crashes. reply",

I assume this is referring to the tweet from the launch of the M1 showing off that retaining and releasing an NSObject is like 3x faster. That's more of a general case of the ARM ISA being a better fit for modern software than x86, not some specific optimization for Apple's software. x86 was designed long before desktops had multi-core processors and out-of-order execution, so for backwards compatibility reasons the architecture severely restricts how the processor is allowed to reorder memory operations. ARM was designed later, and requires software to explicitly request synchronization of memory operations where it's needed, which is much more performant and a closer match for the expectations of modern software, particularly post-C/C++11 (which have a weak memory model at the language level). Reference counting operations are simple atomic increments and decrements, and when your software uses these operations heavily (like Apple's does), it can benefit significantly from running on hardware with a weak memory model. reply",

          "text": "I honestly don't see myself ever leaving Macbooks at this point. It's the whole package: the battery life is insane, I've literally never had a dead laptop when I needed it no matter what I'm doing or where I'm at; it runs circles around every other computer I own, save for my beastly gaming PC; the stability and consistency of MacOS, and the underlying unix arch for a lot of tooling, all the way down to the build quality being damn near flawless save for the annoying lack of ports (though increasingly, I find myself needing ports less and less). Like, would I prefer an older-style Macbook overall, with an integrated card reader, HDMI port, ethernet jack, all that? Yeah, sure. But to get that now I have to go to a PC laptop and there's so many compromises there. The battery life isn't even in the same zip code as a Mac, they're much heavier, the chips run hot even just doing web browsing let alone any actual work, and they CREAK. Like my god I don't remember the last time I had a Windows laptop open and it wasn't making all manner of creaks and groans and squeaks. The last one would be solved I guess if you went for something super high end, or at least I hope it would be, but I dunno if I'm dropping $3k+ either way I'd just as soon stay with the Macbook. reply",

After three years, I upgraded to a MacBook Pro with M3 Pro, 36GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. I use this as my main machine with 2 displays attached via a TB4 dock. I'm working in IT and I get all new machines for our company over my desk to check them, and I observed the exact same points as the OP. The new machines are either fast and loud and hot and with poor battery life, or they are slow and \"warm\" and have moderate battery life. But I had no business laptop yet, ARM, AMD, or Intel, which can even compete with the M1 Air, not to speak of the M3 Pro! Not to speak about all the issues with crappy Lenovo docks, etc. It doesn’t matter if I install Linux or Windows. The funny point is that some of my colleagues have ordered a MacBook Air or Pro and use their Windows or Linux and a virtual machine via Parallels. Think about it: Windows 11 or Linux in a VM is even faster, snappier, more silent, and has even longer battery life than these systems native on a business machine from Lenovo, HP, or Dell. Well, your mileage may vary, but IMHO there is no alternative to a Mac nowadays, even if you want to use Linux or Windows. reply",

          "text": "There’s a number of reasons, all of which in concert create the appearance of a performance gap between the two: * Apple has had decades optimizing its software and hardware stacks to the demands of its majority users, whereas Intel and AMD have to optimize for a much broader scope of use cases. * Apple was willing to throw out legacy support on a regular basis. Intel and AMD, by comparison, are still expected to run code written for DOS or specific extensions in major Enterprises, which adds to complexity and cost * The “standard” of x86 (and demand for newly-bolted-on extensions) means effort into optimizations for efficiency or performance meet diminishing returns fairly quickly. The maturity of the platform also means the “easy” gains are long gone/already done, and so it’s a matter of edge cases and smaller tweaks rather than comprehensive redesigns. * Software in x86 world is not optimized, broadly, because it doesn’t have to be. The demoscene shows what can be achieved in tight performance envelopes, but software companies have never had reason to optimize code or performance when next year has always promised more cores or more GHz. It boils down to comparing two different products and asking why they can’t be the same. Apple’s hardware is purpose-built for its userbase, operating systems, and software; x86 is not, and never has been. Those of us who remember the 80s and 90s of SPARC/POWER/Itanium/etc recall that specialty designs often performed better than generalist ones in their specialties , but lacked compatibility as a result. The Apple ARM vs Intel/AMD x86 is the same thing. reply",

          "text": "Fair enough, but Apple Silicon is not a specialist chip in the way a SPARC chip was. It's a general purpose SoC & SiP stack. There is nothing stopping Intel being able to invest in SoC & SiP and being able to maintain backward compatibility while providing much better power/performance for a mobile (including laptop and tablet), product strategy. They could also just sit down with Microsoft and say \"Right, we're going to go in an entirely different direction, and provide you with something absolutely mind-blowing, but we're going to have to do software emulation for backward compatibility and that will suck for a while until things get recompiled, or it'll suck forever if they never do\". Apple did this twice in the last 20 years - once on the move from PowerPC chips to Intel, and again from Intel to Apple Silicon. If Microsoft and enough large OEMs (Dell, etc.), thought there was enough juice in the new proposed architecture to cause a major redevelopment of everything from mobile to data centre level compute, they'd line right up, because they know that if you can significantly reduce the amount of power consumption while smashing benchmarks, there are going to long, long wait times for that hardware and software, and its pay day for everyone. We now know so much more about processor design, instruction set and compiler design than we did when the x86 was shaping up, it seems obvious to me that: 1. RISC is a proven entity worth investing in 2. SoC & SiP is a proven entity worth investing in 3. Customers love better power/performance curves at every level from the device in their pocket to the racks in data centres 4. Intel is in real trouble if they are seriously considering the US government owning actual equity, albeit proposed as non-voting, non-controlling Intel can keep the x86 line around if they want, but their R&D needs to be chasing where the market is heading - and fast - while bringing the rest of the chain along with them. reply",

The 'emulation story' only needs to work for a couple of generations, then it itself can be sunsetted and is not expected to be backwards compatible with newer OSes. It is also the reason it is pretty much impossible to upgrade CPUs in Apple machines. > IMO, this is better then carrying around 40 years of cruft. Backwards compatibility is such a strong point, it is why windows survives even though it has become a bloated ad riddled mess. You can argue which is better, but that seriously depends on your requirements. If you have a business application coded 30 years ago on x86 that no developer in your company understands any more, then backwards compatibility is king.

This is something that few companies have the ability to do as they target a wide array of hardware. This is even more impressive given the scale of Apple's hardware. The same kernel runs on a Watch and a Mac Studio. Second, the x86 platform has a lot of legacy, and each operation on x86 is translated from an x86 instruction into RISC-like micro-ops. This is an inherent penalty that Apple doesn't have pay, and it is also why Rosetta 2 can achieve \"near native\" x86 performance; both platform translate the x86 instructions. Third, there are some architectural differences even if the instruction decoding steps are removed from the discussion. Apple Silicon has a huge out-of-order buffer, and it's 8-wide vs x86 4-wide. From there, the actual logic is different, the design is different, and the packaging is different. AMD's Ryzen AI Max 300 series does get close to Apple by using many of the same techniques like unified memory and tossing everything onto the package, where it does lose is due to all of the other differences. In the end, if people want crazy efficiency Apple is a great answer and delivers solid performance. If people want the absolute highest performance, then something like Ryzen Threadripper, EPYC, or even the higher-end consumer AMD chips are great choices. reply",

AFAIK, M4 is now 10-wide, and most x86 is 6-wide (Ryzen 5 does some weird stuff). X86 was 4-wide at the time of M1’s introduction. 4. M1 has over 600 reorder buffer registers… it’s significantly larger than competitors. 5. Close relative to x86 competitors. reply",

This is an inherent penalty that Apple doesn't have pay, and it is also why Rosetta 2 can achieve \"near native\" x86 performance; both platform translate the x86 instructions. Can we please stop with this myth? Every superscalar processor is doing the exact same thing, converting the ISA into the µops (which may involve fission or fusion) that are actually serviced by the execution units. It doesn't matter if the ISA is x86 or ARM or RISC-V--it's a feature of the superscalar architecture, not the ISA itself. The only reason that this canard keeps coming out is because the RISC advocates thought that superscalar was impossible to implement for a CISC architecture and x86 proved them wrong, and so instead they pretend that it's only because x86 somehow cheats and converts itself to RISC internally. reply",

I love how I can unplug my headphones from my work Mac, plug directly into the phone (no adapter required!) and it effectively mutes Slack without actually muting it. Syncing with the latest version of iTunes still works, albeit slowly. I also use an iPad 4 (tethered to iOS 6) as an ebook. iBooks works great and I love the pseudomorphic design.

          "text": "I recommend calm and caution :) You will quickly end up researching mechanical split keyboard market and start convincing yourself that 500-1000€ is not that expensive (sic!). I made an adventure into mechanicals, around half a year on research and getting used to it. Configurability is amazing. Quality great. Noise was not a problem. Ended up going back to some flat (laptop-like) dell keyboard and a vertical mouse instead. Because my hands started to stiffen up, hurt, the typical stuff. Keyboards were too high (with normal keys) and too expensive+weird (with low profile keys). I tried adding dedicated palm rests, changing habits a bit, changing bindings... In the end I'm considering buying MS' Sculpt ergonomic keyboard again (it's the one that's actually split, low profile, with optional negative tilt. I think it's only sold with a mouse). It has a lot of flaws, but fatigue was not one of them. What I'm trying to say: you may spend a lot of time, effort and money and still feel miserable. There are amazing builds out there, but don't forget non mechanical options exist. reply",

My take on it is that ergonomic keyboards that limit the amount of finger movement make your typing more repetitive - hence you need to be sure as hell that there is as little strain as possible. I also went with a minimal split keyboard and quickly started to feel pain. When I however looked at my desk/chair/screen, I found that they don't promote the correct posture. Once these were corrected, I got no pain at all. I think the right lesson is that this is a journey, rather than a problem you can throw some money at once and have it solved. reply",

Since this project is an AI resume builder, the accounts hosting the project can easily extract private data, such as phone numbers, emails, and addresses, and use it for malicious purposes, scams, etc. And that's what I'm more worried about. :(<p>I never intended to paywall this project. My goal was to provide a local first alternative to some online resume builders, and the accounts are doing the exact opposite, and they've hosted it at: https://gojob.ing/<p>I've tried commenting on the PR about the features they're working on, but I haven't received any replies so far.<p>What am I supposed to do here?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

          "text": "> This shows how immature the field of software engineering is. Imagine bridges or houses were built like that. You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

          "text": "For me, software design is more comparable to business system and organization design. It’s just that instead of humans executing the processes you design, it’s machines doing it. I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

If you put five engineers of any discipline in a room, you will get five different answers. Every contractor and architect has their own ideas about how things should be done. Furthermore, we do build houses this way, even in the modern age with building codes. The builder is going to do whatever they can get away with and this is a universal truth. The only reason bridges are held to such high standards is because of the monetary cost of a collapse. The \"norms\" are not what you think they are. They're tradition, they're \"we've always done it this way\". What you're talking about are laws written for public safety. Those laws only exist because we tried and failed to do things a certain way and the cost in money or lives was untenable. > \"I recognize a good solution when I see it\" is just not good enough for a serious engineering discipline. You're conflating engineering with science. A scientist will rigorously test and validate, but a huge part of engineering is just recognizing a good solution.

Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

You could imagine a rewrite into another programming language which would preserve the design but completely replace the implementation. You should practice writing design docs.  Don't worry about what the doc is supposed to look like, and definitely don't work off of a template.  The most important thing about the doc is that another human could do the implementation if you gave it to them. The doc can also function as a \"proof of consideration\". If you choose to do something one way, but there are other possible ways to do it, you can acknowledge the other possible ways, and say why they are worse.  By preemptively acknowledging an alternative, you have proved to readers that you considered it. All a \"good\" system designer is doing is considering a larger design space than most, and consistently finding good points in the space.  Pick a problem, sample points in the design space, tell me why some points are better than others, and write it all down. reply",

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

For example how do you determine which code bases are well designed if you yourself are not comfortable determining such? Instead, heed the guidance of some of the other comments and just start building things. Plan on failing and solving for the failure. That’s called practice. With enough practice you will know what works well for you. If you are measuring things along the way you will also know what’s slow. reply",

          "text": "I've done this for years and swear by it. Top 5 codebases for changing my mind about things: Wietse Venema's Postfix mail server. Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

          "text": "That would be quite clever for an incredibly horrible website. The other day my SO, who is a Turkish citizen, was filling up her visa application and after half an hour of meticulous form filling the system just kick her out. I think the session times out or something. If you haven't created an account or you haven't write down the current application ID everything is lost. In the process she was also directed to a non-.gov website for something during the process, I thought she was getting scammed but no. It actually makes sense to have a paid service that makes this abomination less painful. Though they work with VFS Global for collecting the applications and relevant documents, the VFS Global itself is an abomination and doesn't help with the handling of the form filling anyway. Recently EU streamlined the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens as those \"visa agencies\" that are the official agencies and the only way to apply for a visa for many countries don't actually help with anything and are scamming people by selling the \"good hours\" for the visa appointment on the black market. An agency was dropped for this and the scams by agencies were listed among the reasons to streamline the application process. Both with US and EU people are losing scholarships etc. due to outrageous wait times that are sometimes are years ahead or there's an issue with the systems handling the applications. I guess there must be an opportunity there to fix all this together with smaller stuff like handling transliteration and character encodings, I wonder if some of those scam site are not scams and actually help with it. An AI agent  can be useful here. reply",

I'll approximate the throttle by limiting chrome to 128kbps, 500ms delay, and 5% packet loss for fun. With a fresh incognito session, google responds to \"here to 4th street\" in 10 seconds, and when I click to open maps it needs just under two minutes to load.  Then I can click on the transit option and it needs another 10 seconds to update. Not too bad for a cold cache.  If I do it again with a hot cache it only takes 20 seconds to go through the whole process.  And I expect the app to be similar to the hot cache situation.  Even with 64kbps I'd expect reasonable results.  Do any cell providers throttle worse than that? I agree with your argument about bloat in general, but google in particular has a lot of good engineering resources and tries to work well on bad connections. Also I would be in favor of some spectrum licensing rules that say you can't throttle below 1Mbps... reply",

This is common.  Work begins on some web sites immediately after the election. For example, when a new president is sworn in, the White House web site flips immediately. More to the parent poster's point, it has been widely reported in the legitimate media repeatedly that many federal web sites have been replaced or significantly altered by the current administration.  There's an entire pseudo-department for it that also makes headlines for its greater transgressions. Add to that severe and sudden budget and staffing cuts, and like all government functions -- you get what you pay for. reply",

          "text": "Hi, about the Schengen visa situation in Turkey you can find articles like these that describe how the appointments are on the black market(In Turkish but I'm sure AI will do good job translating): https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5r2l43kn2o https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/22/vize-sorunu-kontrolden-cikt... On the social media the anecdotes differ but some say they were able to get the visa appointments bots, others say it was agency personel selling it to them under the table. Maybe its really the agency personel, or maybe it's people running bots to snap appointments and sell those pretending to be from the agency - can't know for sure but there are multiple services where people purchase appointments unofficially. In general the news situation in Turkey isn't very good as with the law enforcement but as you can see even BBC took notice. Generally speaking, these visa agencies are very unfriendly and unreachable. They seem to just collect the money, provide no personalized help at all. My GF had some questions about her US visa application, we were not able to reach VFS Global.  The phone numbers provided don't work, it's not even like taking long to speak with a human, the phone just gives you calling error. She previously used the same company for her Schengen visa for a company event in Paris, of course unreachable again and no appointments available. Because she works at a French corporation, she was able to ask a high ranking French person in the company who has a contact with the French embassy and they arranged the appointment shortly. reply",

Besides that, EU has \"green passport\" exception for the Turkish nationals, where they can travel visa-free on this kind of passport that is provided to individuals that meet certain criteria and millions of such passports were issued. The rejection rates are also not bad and EU has a \"return agreement\" with Turkey, which is designed to keep the middle eastern refugees in Turkey(essentially, if you come from Turkey EU can send you back to Turkey right away ).

But you were also chastised for saying “you guys” -\n even though the women said as much as the men, if you didn’t put the proper pronouns under your profile.  I got chastised for saying “war room”.  I heard an anecdote that now “pow wow” wasn’t allowed. One podcast I listen to - Stuff You Should Know - replayed an old episode and added a disclaimer up front apologizing  because the episode was about pregnancy complications and in the older episode they were being “heteronormative” by not calling out that this issue only affects cisgendered women. I’m not saying anyone should be disrespected or I wouldn’t call someone by whatever name or pronoun they prefer. I also found all of the “ally” groups, discussion of “micro aggressions” etc groan worthy. This is in the DNCs charter https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-gender-non... > The language now says committees “shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1).”\nGender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, “and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided.” Yes I would find this just as bad if the language was about race and someone of mixed race heritage. I would much rather hang out with good live and let live traditional “guns and church family centered” old school Hank Hill conservatives (even though I’m not one), than the posturing “anti-racist” leftist wing. reply",

Nobody felt “silenced” by avoiding harmful words.\nThen came the hyperboles and the rigid rules you describe. To me, these are very similar to the poor-quality AI filters I discuss in my article: they judge without context. But judging requires more than scanning words—it requires understanding how, why, when, and under what circumstances something is said.\nWhat you’ve experienced—and thank you for sharing—is the result of bad, simplistic policy created by people who haven’t truly tried to understand or adapt. Human beings, societies, even nature itself, are complex systems. They can’t be reduced to mechanical yes/no rules.\nThat’s the heart of my article. And what I truly believe—as an eternal optimist—is that we can get to a place of smarter filters and smarter ways to coexist. It will take time, patience, and sincere effort.

Of course, it did reach a point of hyperbole—where even historic artworks were misread as offensive or racist. As the Greeks said: “Μέτρον ἄριστον”—balance is best. We don’t need to provoke just to indulge our worst instincts, but we also need tolerance for expressions that aren’t perfectly curated. That said, my article isn’t really about political correctness. It’s about low-quality AI filters that can’t read context, and the corporate shortcuts that rely on them. My point isn’t to rant or complain, but to suggest a new era of content moderation—one that’s smarter, fairer, and more democratic. reply",

The thing that is driving me crazy in this world though is the 'tab tab tab' view that these approaches have. It is hard enough when predictive text tries to finish the word I am typing much less a whole sentence or code block. It is very hard to think freely when something is whispering in your ear what you should say next. I am very hesitant to look at VSCode. I have strong push back against Microsoft related tools (related, best alternative to GitHub?) That is mostly on principle now though. I have avoided them so long that I can't honestly comment on their quality anymore. Everything Microsoft though long term seem so to...degrade. It does it in a way that when you finally realize you hate the tool you also realize you should have jumped 2 years ago. They are so good at finding the line where it is just good enough and just barely keeping you there, but not clearly above it. Thanks for the suggestions! reply",

I know when people are lying, I know when something is off, but I cannot really pinpoint what it is.<p>And by the way, if you are hinting at autism and whatever, this is not helpful. Not for me, not for you, not for anybody.<p>The question is if you can relate. And what you did yourself, if you can or could relate, to get out of this. And only speak from experience, I don't want some \"ten rules on how to do whatever\" by some guru, but I want your real experience, how you handled this, how you got out of it, and how you started trusting your own opinion more, or how you found truth outside that made you so secure in a solution for problem or gave you a lot of answers at once like an avalanche.<p>Just in general, what is your source for answers?<p>PS: Currently AI fills this void for me.

I’d first note down what I already know or would try. Then compare outside input to that. It built trust in my own reasoning. Now I treat all advice (AI included) as raw input, not truth.

The only issue with this plan is that as far as I can tell there's no easy way to only install the Audio Bookshelf app, and remove all other apps. While if the device does not have internet access I'm not concerned about them poking around in the email, calendar, etc it'd be nice if there were fewer distractions.

          "text": "I wonder where the prior-generation servers end up once well-funded companies upgrade E-waste recyclers because they can handle bulk. Suppose 500 servers get replaced. To a first approximation, nobody who needs 500 servers is interested in 500 old servers and if they were they already bought 500 servers or are waiting for a better deal or aren’t ready to move out their 500 servers to make room. Recyclers have the real estate to receive 500 servers and experience disposing 500 servers. And there are not 500 hobbyists lined up…and who wants to deal with misinformed consumers? There are all sorts of incompatibility nuances with complex computer hardware. ——- Advice: If your hobby is gonna be training models, just build a box. If you want a server rack hobby, then buy a server rack and be ready to pay the dumb tax. reply",

From this pov, AI is the best thing that has happened to my weekend coding. I code recreationally way more than before. Before AI, I would try a new language or framework, and I’d give up halfway because re-figuring out basic stuff for the umpteenth time is boring, it’s not fun at all. Now AI lets me skip those boring parts. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

MeeGo proceeded far too slowly and Elop chose his former employers' Windows instead in 2011. Nokia's decline only increased and Intel hired many Nokia engineers. Soon Nokia made no phone anymore and Intel did not even manage to make their first mass-selling product. ARM-based SoCs were 10 years ahead in power saving. The ARM ecosystem did not make any fatal mistakes, Intel never caught up. reply",

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

That makes its CPU cores a fair bit less efficient that AMDs even on the same production node. If Apple Silicon didn't exist then you might instead argue that x86-64 is more efficient than ARM. If all that's true then why does Snapdragon have better battery life? As I said in my comment the great battery life comes from when the CPU isn't being used. It's everything else around it. That's where AMD is still significantly behind. reply",

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

For Blender numbers, M4 Pro numbers came from Max Tech's review.[0] I don't remember where I got the Strix Halo numbers from. Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon.

A lot of the problems here can't actually be fixed by intel, amd, or anyone designing x86 laptops because getting that level of efficiency requires the ability to strongly lead the app developer community. It also requires highly competent operating system developers focusing on the issue for a very long time, and being able to co-design the operating system, firmware and hardware together. Microsoft barely cares about Windows anymore, the Linux guys only care about servers since forever, and that leaves Apple alone in the market. I doubt anything will change anytime soon. reply",

And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps?

I'm away from home so can't open up my NAS and look) so not worth my time to optimize it. On the flip side it's fun to randomly browse through and take a trip down memory lane.

          "text": "+1. My basic structure is a big share/ directory that is mounted on all my machines (over sshfs + tailscale if need be). There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

His family has spent years and $millions getting him to the point of looking & sounding pretty good, within that very limited social context.  But he's never actually made a PB&J sandwich.  Let alone gotten dressed and gone to the grocery store by himself. Over cocktails, Mr. ChatGPT seems darned impressive.

          "text": "A couple of things I'll point out. Evolution occurs at the level of population genetics, and it's not concerned with finding a stable state for any characteristic, at least not directly. But more importantly to your question, the way we define society right now, or agree to be governed, is not a given, and it's not a fundamental quality of the universe or its reality. Society in this point in time is an artifact of this point in time, and the accumulation of our historical and cultural works. So what is the societal problem, and for whom? How is the meaning of such a problem transferred from a social phenomena (resource allocation) to a biological one (stress responses, like cortisol homeostasis) to one which affects populations (propagation of some phenotype or genes)? You have to connect sentience and cognition in a direct line with biological stress responses and evolutionary genetics, and its effect on brain evolution. It's an interesting question, but it depends on how it is decomposed and framed. reply",

          "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not a researcher in this topic and I have no idea what I'm talking about, just putting my thoughts here I think that depends on how you define stress? The brain is all electrical signals, so from this simplistic point of view there shouldn't be such thing as \"stress\", but from my understanding the connections, even though electrical, produce chemical by-products which have to be \"flushed away\" by the gray matter. This and just human experience suggests brain can get \"tired\". However, I don't think the societal problems throughout history had much relevance to the individual stress brains my experience, but more caused by cognitive dissonance when you try to put two conscious beings together, as every brain is different so produces different outputs to same input. Additionally, we still are very much driven by our animal instincts, even though we like to pretend we've \"ascended\" and have free will. Now the question is, where can we evolve from here? What evolutionary pressure is there to evolve? We've pretty much peaked as lifeforms, we can dominate any and every environment we want to the point of being detrimental to the Earth itself. Also this highly scientific documentary I re-watched recently called \"Idiocracy (2006)\" suggests that higher brain function doesn't necessarily increase the chance of passing genes along, and I tend to agree. reply",

But this is preventing me from using some services and products (Vercel, DocuSign, etc.)<p>I’m curious about the reasons behind this. Is it primarily technical (spam prevention, deliverability issues), business-driven (carriers pushing back on VoIP), or just an easy way to block disposable accounts? Is something more dystopian going on, like some kind of behind-the-scenes lookup of my \"true\" info if I provide my cell?<p>Also, if anyone has insight into how companies technically detect and filter VoIP numbers at scale, I’d love to understand that side too. E.g. what lookup info via Twilio causes a number to get rejected?  I assume it is the 'type' from Twilio Line Type Intelligence (or equivalent)?<p>https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api/line-type-intelligence</p></p></p></p></div>",

Do I believe other intelligent life forms visit earth in their flying saucers, abduct people, anal probe them, abduct and slaughter cows, build pyramids, and - apparently - crash often? No, not really. I mean, I can't rule it out, but my personal subjective Bayesian prior towards this notion would probably be something like 0.001 or so. But that's actually up from years past, as we learn more about more possibly inhabitable planets that are closer to Earth than was previously known, etc. reply",

In the past in various projects this approach proved problematic because \"environment parity\" with the target runtime (browser) couldn't be achieved (e.g. no WebRTC[1]). In those projects we resolved this problem by writing our own test runner that could be injected into a headless browser process.<p>So now the same sort of problem has arisen with a mobile device project using react native: I assumed that unit tests would be runnable on a device or at least an emulator, but it seems not (see: https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/). Or at least so far I haven't found the secret sauce or tool to allow that. Any pointers welcome.<p>[1]Yes there is a WebRTC port for Node that uses an old version of Google's C++ library, but it doesn't actually work properly.</p></p></div>",

I'm a senior web developer and help maintain hundreds of PHP repositories for work. I avoid the use of AI as best I can. When I do ask questions to an LLM, I feel that I'm partaking in a dirty habit that I should quit. I don't have anything for that installed on my machine/integrated in my IDE. I feel that using LLMs to understand and solve problems is unreliable, a barrier for my personal development, a threat to the future of the industry I work in, unfair to those who wrote the content it is trained on, and bad for the environment.

          "text": "The term \"design\" is ambiguous here. When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better.

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

A team of juniors will butcher your intricate design and Conway’s Law makes your software reflect the team. reply",

The most important thing about the doc is that another human could do the implementation if you gave it to them. The doc can also function as a \"proof of consideration\". If you choose to do something one way, but there are other possible ways to do it, you can acknowledge the other possible ways, and say why they are worse.

It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match .

Good design is so deeply tied to the domain details. Wonham's Internal Model Principle applies to code. Example: I wanted to solve the problem of unit testing for embedded targets. I found open source projects that do this and read the code critically to see how and why it is written. As I build my own approach, I revisit theirs to learn more as my understanding of the domain deepens. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">By \"archetypically savvy\", I mean websites and other online communities that are both somewhat niche and known for specific mannerisms. I'd say that the key mannerism that distinguishes these online communities from the rest is when someone posts a link to another unfamiliar site and other users of the community respond almost reflexively that it is an \"ip logger\" or an \"ip grabber\", since they have assimilated into the online community's culture.<p>I've also found that these sites have a tendency to revolve around their Discord channels more than the actual website, oftentimes creating a secretive culture that lacks transparency. The participants of the Discord usually come there to spill the tea about users who've been caught up in a scandal. At best, it's usually something like a user \"scraping the site\" or \"botting the site\", and at worst, the userbase finding out that a prominent user has engaged in online grooming and what have you. More often than not, it's a member of the \"staff team\" that gets caught red handed.<p>Lastly, I would also like to mention that online communities that exhibit the hallmarks outlined above seem disproportionately prone to either having server emulators and \"private servers\" created to replicate the functionality of the online community's website or game, or having parts of their codebase leaked outright. Whichever of those two happens, there's always a culture about users having access to the original site or game source code being the gatekeepers of secret knowledge.<p>I'm aware that these online communities can be very sketchy, and I don't mean to condone these specific online communities that have these traits. I just want to get everyone's input on the extent that they have encountered online communities that match my description, without explicitly naming the sites or games in question. I just wonder if this archetype is actually more common than I previously thought.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'm building Concert Map [1], an interactive map of live music events all over the world. I was frustrated with how difficult it was to find concerts and festivals when travel plans are flexible. Questions like: - Is there any show I could catch on my next cross country road trip? - I want an excuse to visit Seattle this summer, is there a good weekend I could pick where I could see live music there or along the way? - I like to travel for one big music festival per year, is there a good match for me anywhere in the country, or abroad? The idea behind concert map is to show all events on a map, and highlight the \"most relevant\" events for any area, so you can skim through the map and find events that are worth the travel. The \"relevant\" events depend on the view context. If you import your top artists, then the most relevant events are ones with artists that you listen to most. Otherwise, it's based on global artist popularity. I'm currently working on integrating with more event providers, and working on loading performance. I've been using leaflet.js [2] which has worked great, but I'm experimenting with switching to supercluster [3].

My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

MeeGo proceeded far too slowly and Elop chose his former employers' Windows instead in 2011. Nokia's decline only increased and Intel hired many Nokia engineers. Soon Nokia made no phone anymore and Intel did not even manage to make their first mass-selling product. ARM-based SoCs were 10 years ahead in power saving.

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

Wrote a demo to select a song from a playlist with few thousand author-album-song with voice query. The WiFi add-on was a big plastic \"sleeve\", that the iPaq slid into, not the other way around.

That makes its CPU cores a fair bit less efficient that AMDs even on the same production node. If Apple Silicon didn't exist then you might instead argue that x86-64 is more efficient than ARM. If all that's true then why does Snapdragon have better battery life? As I said in my comment the great battery life comes from when the CPU isn't being used. It's everything else around it.

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "The reason why I keep reposting this table is because people post incorrect statements about AMD/Apple so often, often with zero data backing. For Blender numbers, M4 Pro numbers came from Max Tech's review.[0] I don't remember where I got the Strix Halo numbers from. Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

          "text": "> Any recommendations on how to start a life as a digital hoarder? Step 1: Get a NAS or whatever, and copy over things manually when you know you care about them. That's pretty much it for at least some basic protections, and not starting a whole project. Just made checksums before you send it, and verify the checksums after you send it, and that's pretty much it. Then step 2-6 can involve doing encrypted off-site (cloud) syncing of your backups, automatic backuping and so on, but as a first step, just do something small and easy, so it won't feel like a hassle in the future. reply",

I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around. Or at least some virtual machine / runtime that could be ported to some new OS / platform. reply",

I focus a lot more on value to the customer; opportunity is now the limiting factor, so I have the product manager hat on most of the time.  So I actually do less coding, pruning almost everything that I used to do just to see if I could. 4. I do try harder problems and techniques, because with AI I can typically get to a MVP I can validate and iterate (i.e., it minimizes the stage where nothing is really working).  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it just gets blocked; it's more like hunting than gardening or building. Overall, it's made skills matter less and opportunity/connections matter more, and those are mostly outside my control.

In theory now I can write programmes because I know what I want to do but I don't have a good knowledge of all the details so spent too long looking at docs or Stackoverflow. Now in theory I can write useful programs with AI. In some ways this makes me more keen to create and design programs. In other ways this means I don't really need to learn all the details that I didn't learn recently anymore. Also stuff like leetcode goes away hopefully soon as as long as you understand a data structure and it's benefits you don't have to learn to implement it in every language? reply",

          "text": "The iPad 2 can be downgraded to iOS 6.1.3 or 8.4.1. Both offer better performance than iOS 9 and have untethered jailbreaks. Once downgraded and jailbroken you can sideload hours and hours worth of games. A lot from that era are IAP-free. I use an iPhone 5 downgraded to iOS 6 (tethered) as an iPod. I love how I can unplug my headphones from my work Mac, plug directly into the phone (no adapter required!) and it effectively mutes Slack without actually muting it. Syncing with the latest version of iTunes still works, albeit slowly. I also use an iPad 4 (tethered to iOS 6) as an ebook. iBooks works great and I love the pseudomorphic design.

Both items are under $200.<p>If it were any other company, I would feel justified going to my credit card company and disputing the charge. However, I understand that if I initiate a chargeback, Google could terminate my account, so they have all the leverage in this interaction. I fully rely on my Google account for phone service (Pixel phone with Fi), email service (Gmail), documents/spreadsheets, photos, maps, and likely other items that are not coming to mind.<p>This event has made me realize that I've put too much of my life in one provider, and I need to switch.

Apple office apps are all MS compatible as is Libre Office. I try to do nothing \"in the cloud\" since any information that leaves the home is, IMO, subject to loss and seizure. reply",

They don't solve it. They offer some help, but it's far from good enough. The exact reason why I don't want my stuff included isn't really relevant to the topic, honestly (\"I don't like it\" is plenty sufficient reason, after all), but I will say there are multiple reasons. The main issue is that if it happens, there's no way to correct for that. IP violation is one of them, but not the main one -- but it does illustrate the point: in the case of more traditional IP \"theft\", there is technically a way to resolve the problem after it happens.

          "text": "A couple of things I'll point out. Evolution occurs at the level of population genetics, and it's not concerned with finding a stable state for any characteristic, at least not directly. But more importantly to your question, the way we define society right now, or agree to be governed, is not a given, and it's not a fundamental quality of the universe or its reality. Society in this point in time is an artifact of this point in time, and the accumulation of our historical and cultural works. So what is the societal problem, and for whom? How is the meaning of such a problem transferred from a social phenomena (resource allocation) to a biological one (stress responses, like cortisol homeostasis) to one which affects populations (propagation of some phenotype or genes)? You have to connect sentience and cognition in a direct line with biological stress responses and evolutionary genetics, and its effect on brain evolution. It's an interesting question, but it depends on how it is decomposed and framed. reply",

          "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not a researcher in this topic and I have no idea what I'm talking about, just putting my thoughts here I think that depends on how you define stress? The brain is all electrical signals, so from this simplistic point of view there shouldn't be such thing as \"stress\", but from my understanding the connections, even though electrical, produce chemical by-products which have to be \"flushed away\" by the gray matter. This and just human experience suggests brain can get \"tired\". However, I don't think the societal problems throughout history had much relevance to the individual stress brains my experience, but more caused by cognitive dissonance when you try to put two conscious beings together, as every brain is different so produces different outputs to same input. Additionally, we still are very much driven by our animal instincts, even though we like to pretend we've \"ascended\" and have free will. Now the question is, where can we evolve from here? What evolutionary pressure is there to evolve? We've pretty much peaked as lifeforms, we can dominate any and every environment we want to the point of being detrimental to the Earth itself. Also this highly scientific documentary I re-watched recently called \"Idiocracy (2006)\" suggests that higher brain function doesn't necessarily increase the chance of passing genes along, and I tend to agree. reply",

I can read a codebase and run simulations in my head. But this almost never results in learning anything. I can study code and see how a particular task is done, but I don't learn it until I put it into practice. Just about the only thing I get from reading other people's code is the most egregious ways to not do something. This is a pretty common thing, a plurality of humans learn this way. We just have different standards for software, for some reason. We like to pretend books teach you something more \"real\" than just getting your hands dirty and writing some real fucked up code. But the reality is that figuring out why your disaster code doesn't work, and then fixing it is one of the most educational experiences a programmer can have. reply",

When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

          "text": "For me, software design is more comparable to business system and organization design. It’s just that instead of humans executing the processes you design, it’s machines doing it. I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

If you put five engineers of any discipline in a room, you will get five different answers. Every contractor and architect has their own ideas about how things should be done. Furthermore, we do build houses this way, even in the modern age with building codes. The builder is going to do whatever they can get away with and this is a universal truth. The only reason bridges are held to such high standards is because of the monetary cost of a collapse. The \"norms\" are not what you think they are. They're tradition, they're \"we've always done it this way\". What you're talking about are laws written for public safety. Those laws only exist because we tried and failed to do things a certain way and the cost in money or lives was untenable. > \"I recognize a good solution when I see it\" is just not good enough for a serious engineering discipline. You're conflating engineering with science. A scientist will rigorously test and validate, but a huge part of engineering is just recognizing a good solution. Of course there's a lot of testing and validation in engineering as well, but not with the kind of rigor you're implying. reply",

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

The most important thing about the doc is that another human could do the implementation if you gave it to them. The doc can also function as a \"proof of consideration\". If you choose to do something one way, but there are other possible ways to do it, you can acknowledge the other possible ways, and say why they are worse.  By preemptively acknowledging an alternative, you have proved to readers that you considered it.

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

          "text": "I've done this for years and swear by it. Top 5 codebases for changing my mind about things: Wietse Venema's Postfix mail server. Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve noticed that more and more companies refuse to accept Google Voice numbers when creating accounts.<p>My company's main line is a Google Voice that forwards to my cell; I never give out my cell. But this is preventing me from using some services and products (Vercel, DocuSign, etc.)<p>I’m curious about the reasons behind this. Is it primarily technical (spam prevention, deliverability issues), business-driven (carriers pushing back on VoIP), or just an easy way to block disposable accounts? Is something more dystopian going on, like some kind of behind-the-scenes lookup of my \"true\" info if I provide my cell?<p>Also, if anyone has insight into how companies technically detect and filter VoIP numbers at scale, I’d love to understand that side too. E.g. what lookup info via Twilio causes a number to get rejected?  I assume it is the 'type' from Twilio Line Type Intelligence (or equivalent)?<p>https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api/line-type-intelligence</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "If you need to bypass censorship, you'll need a tool specifically designed for anti-censorship, rather than any one repurposed for that. Since China has the most advanced network censorship, the Chinese have also invented the most advanced anti-censorship tools. The first generation is shadowsocks. It basically encrypts the traffic from the beginning without any handshakes, so DPI cannot find out its nature. This is very simple and fast and should suffice in most places. The second generation is the Trojan protocol. The lack of a handshake in shadowsocks is also a distinguishing feature that may alert the censor and the censor can decide to block shadowsocks traffic based on suspicions alone. Trojan instead tries to blend in the vast amount of HTTPS traffic over the Internet by pretending to be a normal Web server protected by HTTPS. After Trojan, a plethora of protocol based on TLS camouflaging have been invented. 1. Add padding to avoid the TLS-in-TLS traffic characteristics in the original Trojan protocol. Protocols: XTLS-VLESS-VISION. 2. Use QUIC instead of TCP+TLS for better performance (very visible if your latency to your tunnel server is high). Protocols: Hysteria2 and TUIC. 3. Multiplex multiple proxy sessions in one TCP connection. Protocols: h2mux, smux, yamux. 4. Steal other websites' certificates. Protocols: ShadowTLS, ShadowQUIC, XTLS-REALITY. Oh, and there is masking UDP traffic as ICMP traffic or TCP traffic to bypass ISP's QoS if you are proxying traffic through QUIC. Example: phantun. reply",

Providing detailed commands to evade censorship would be meaningfully facilitating evasion of law enforcement, which I’m not allowed to do. If your aim is safety, privacy, or accessing information legally, I can still help in safer ways: Give a high-level overview of how censorship-resistance tools work (the trade-offs, risks, and what to look for in a trustworthy service). Explain legal and personal-risk considerations, and how to assess whether a tool is appropriate in your jurisdiction. Suggest safer, legal alternatives (e.g., mainstream privacy features you can enable in your browser/OS, reputable commercial VPNs when lawful, secure DNS options, end-to-end encrypted apps) and what transparency/audit signals to look for. Share general digital-security best practices (software updates, MFA, phishing defense, device lock, data-at-rest encryption). Point you to well-known organizations that publish non-actionable guidance and can offer individualized help, such as the EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense, Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, or Citizen Lab. If you’d like, tell me your goal (e.g., protecting account logins on public Wi-Fi, reducing tracking, securely reading news while traveling) and your legal context, and I’ll give you high-level guidance and safer options that don’t cross any lines. reply",

          "text": "Even if somehow a Kessler syndrome [1] type event (a chain reaction of debris busting other satellites creating even more debris)  was intentionally triggered, the effects are not what most people think. Launches would remain perfectly safe simply because space is massive . What would happen is that certain orbital velocities would end up with an unacceptably high risk of collision over time, and so you wouldn't want to go into orbits that spend any significant amount of time at those velocities. The neat thing about orbital mechanics is that your orbital altitude is determined 100% by your orbital velocity. Even in the case of an eccentric orbit, your velocity changes as you go from your furthest point to your closest point. A purely circularized orbit is an orbit where your velocity stays constant. Extremely high energy debris would often end up escaping Earth's orbit and probably end up orbiting the Sun. And lower energy debris would often end up entering the atmosphere and burning up. So only fragments that remain in a sort of demented goldilocks zone would end up being dangerous. So in general I think the answer is - not much, especially in strikes of satellites near LEO. US, Russia, China, and India have all carried out live fire tests of anti-satellite weapons. [1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome reply",

Some larger pieces, some smaller. If those intersect with other satellites, they may generate additional debris (see Kessler Syndrome, what parent was talking about). But on the other hand, low earth orbits (where Starlink et al operate) will decay much faster than higher orbits, so it's a {wait time} problem rather than a {have to cleanup manually} problem. And also space, even Earth orbits, is big. Satellites manage not to hit each other most of the time. A limited strike (e.g. the previous US or Chinese demonstrations) probably won't cascade. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s). - First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship. - Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer. Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups. Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator ( https://github.com/OperatorFoundation ). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case. In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols. - The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term. I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space). reply",

Even if you can't broadcast from inside a territory you can broadcast from outside. It can be jammed but it is a tough cat and mouse game and jamming isn't precise. So when you jam there are causalities. Not to mention that jamming can be quite expensive. I'm not saying that makes the problem easy, but I'll say that jamming isn't a very strong defense. Though the bigger issue here is probably bandwith. It's hard to be both long range and data dense. There's probably easier ways to distribute this. Hell, both Koreas are known to transport different things via balloons. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia [1] It is also why projects like Tor and Signal get funding from RFA. Maybe the US doesn't want encrypted services here, but if anything, it's for the same reason they do want encrypted services in other countries. reply",

I understand the confusion though, this phrasing could be better. > your government can decide to block unknown protocols This does happen, though when I worked in the industry it wasn't common. Blocking of specific protocols was much more of an obstacle. > you should trick DPI into thinking it sees HTTPS. Unless your government decides to block HTTPS HTTPS blocking (typically based on either the presence of a specific SNI field value, or based on the use of the ESNI/ECH TLS extension) was prolific. I won't comment on whether this was effective or not in impeding efforts to get people in these places connected. I will say though, Operator's Replicant does something similar to what you're describing in that it can mimic unrelated protocols. It's a clever approach, unfortunately it was a bit immature when I was working in that area so the team didn't adopt it while I was around. reply",

DPI might pick up on proxy headers.\nalternatively, idk how far one would get just slapping wireguard or openvpn on a VPS somewhere on port 443. that used to work fairly well but i suppose my experience there is like 10+ years out of date by now. i know a US based tech firm i worked for around 2020 had a simple HTTPS proxy for chinese clients to download content updates. worked really well. it was hosted on some cloud provider and accessible via DNS name. so its not like it wasn't easy to block it. they just didn't bother or it was lost in a sea of other similar activities. that all being said, regarding oppressive regimes and political turmoil situations: \nif your health or freedom is at risk, don't rely on internet people's 'guesswork' (hard to tell where ppl get their info from, and what its based on etc.). be careful. if you are not confident, don't go forward with it.

          "text": "> I have done math classes What classes? It's a bit hard to suggest what is appropriate without understanding where you currently are. > to brush up. But I think this might be the wrong approach. Especially for these topics. Instead of learning the minimum you need to just understand a specific algorithm, you should understand what the symbols mean, what they are doing, and how they are interacting with one another. Math is a language. But it is a language designed for precision. A big part of why I'm saying this is because at their core, these are not difficult equations from a computational perspective. You really just need to understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My point is that the hard part about math often isn't the calculation part. Let's take B-Splines for an example and look at what Wiki says > A B-spline is defined as a piecewise polynomial of order n, meaning a degree of n − 1. Either this is simple or incomprehensible, so let's break it down. What does piecewise mean? Here's an example piecewise function. a     if x > 0\n  f(x) = {0     x = 0\n          b     if x < 0 Given you're on HN and looking at computer graphics, I take it you're familiar with if statements? That's the same thing here. Let's translate. Looking at things from a different perspective can really help. if x > 0:\n    return a\n  else if x < 0:\n    return b\n  else: # x == 0\n    return 0 We should think of x as a location and we're just describing something about that location. Here's another piecewise function, but now in everyday English: \"Across the street all the houses end in even numbers, but on my side of the street all the houses are odd.\" There's always more ways to look at something. If you can't see what something means from this angle, try another. Be that another book teaching the same thing or another framework to describe the same thing. Get multiple perspectives. One will make more sense than another but which one that is tends to be personal. \"polynomial of order n\" A polynomial is an equation like a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n}. Sorry, let me rewrite that: a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n} Now in code for i in range(n):\n      sum += a[i] * math.pow(x, i) But we should break this down more, just like before. What is a_0? It is just a number. What does this represent? A point. What is a_1*x? That's a line. x is an arbitrary location. The a_1 is a scaling factor. So if a_1 is the number 2, then what our x is representing is all numbers (..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...} (is that all my neighbors across the street?) The a_2 x^2 is a curve, specifically a parabola. We can do the same thing. But also remember we're summing them together. So you have a point, a line, and a parabola. When you add them together you get something that is none of those things. What is really important here is that these functions you are interested in have a really critical property. They can be used to approximate almost anything. That almost part is really important, but you're going to have to dig deeper. My point here is that take time to slow down. Don't rush this stuff. I promise you that if you take time to slow down then the speed will come. But if you try to go too fast you'll just end up getting stuck. This is tricky stuff. When learning it doesn't always make a ton of sense and unfortunately(?) when you do understand it it is almost obvious. Think of the slowing down part like making a plan. In a short race you should just take off running without thinking. But if it is longer then you will go faster if you first plan and strategize. It is the same thing here and I promise you this isn't a short race. You don't win a marathon by winning a bunch of consecutive sprints. The only thing you win by trying that is a trip to the hospital. So slow down. Break problems apart. Find one part you think is confusing and focus on that. If it all seems confusing then try to walk through and force yourself to say why it is confusing. Keep doing this until you have something you understand. It is an iterative process. It'll feel slow, but I promise it pays dividends. Any complex problem can be broken down into a bunch of small problems[0] You got this! [0] This sentence doesn't just apply to how to figure things out, it applies directly to what you're trying to do and why you want these functions. If it doesn't make sense now, revisit, it will later. reply",

In particular; the idea of breaking down a polynomial as a sum of terms, mapping each term to a graphical view (i.e. analytic to coordinate geometry) and then realizing such a sum of terms can be a complex curve (i.e. a complex graphical view) which can be an approximation of almost any function. The teaching of mathematics has become so abstract that students are not taught how to map it to geometry which is THE way to build intuition. You can understand a lot by just imagining 2D/3D mappings before generalizing to n-dimensional vector spaces.

Go brush up on parametric equations, implicit vs explicit representations, and play around with simple spline examples. 2D is enough to get the idea.

          "text": "It's a bit difficult to say, since some of those textbooks (e.g. Shirley) cover preliminary math topics as well. It sounds like you need to get a stronger understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and approach maths from a healthier viewpoint. Something like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right often forces people to treat linear algebra with the slow care it requires, but this may be a bit too extreme. Now that you have some applications in mind, write down all of the terms and concepts that are involved that you don't understand. Go back to a first-year textbook, something like Stewart's Calculus is probably ideal since it is designed to work up to e.g. Bezier curves. However, this time, I would not suggest relying on the exercises for understanding. Instead, place strong emphasis on the definitions and theorems, drawing them together into a diagram with the terms from earlier to really understand why each concept is required for another concept. Your objective should be to see how these ideas lead to the definition of those curves, and why it has to be that way. Be skeptical and try thinking of alternatives; you might find them to have issues, or coincide with what has already been found! Make sure you understand each concept first before you apply it; this will not be a fast process, and if you need to check something, be sure to do it. But thinking in the context of what you want to learn later is often helpful, I find. There are other, more detailed guides out there, mostly geared toward higher level math, e.g. https://www.susanrigetti.com/math and you might find the early parts of these useful too. Also, I have found chatbots to be reasonable at giving tailored explanations for a given topic, so there is rarely harm in using them to supplement your learning. Just don't use them to solve problems for you. reply",

          "text": "It sounds like you've got something specific in mind when you say, \"modeling\". The term modeling is used in a lot of different situations to mean different things. For example, it could mean to make a 3d model in Blender, it could mean to pose for someone to paint you or to take a photo, with databases it's used to mean modeling the data, with statistics it's used to mean finding a way to simply represent and reason about the data (create a model of it). The things you've listed out make me guess you want to write 2d or 3d image rendering software. Is that right? If that's the case, there's no substitute for trying to recreate certain algorithms or curves using a language or tool that you're comfortable with. It'll help you build an intuition about how the mathematical object behaves and what problems it solves (and doesn't). All of these approaches were created to solve problems, understanding the theory of it doesn't quite get you there. If you don't have a good place to try out functions, I recommend https://thebookofshaders.com/05/ , https://www.desmos.com/calculator , or https://www.geogebra.org/calculator . A good place to start is linear interpolation (lerp). It seems dead simple, but it's used extensively to blend two things together (say positions or colors) and the other things you listed are mostly fancier things built on top of linear interpolation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation For bezier curves and surfaces here are some links I've collected over the years: https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/ https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.... http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=730 https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/drawings.html https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatt... A final note: a lot of graphics math involves algebra. Algebra can be fun, but it also can be frustrating and tedious, particularly when you're working through something large and make a silly mistake and the result doesn't work. I suggest using sympy to rearrange equations or do substitutions and so on. It can seem like overkill but as soon as you save a few hours debugging it's worth it. It also does differentiation and integration for you along with simplifying equations. https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/intro... reply",

          "text": "For geometry, start with high-school algebra and coordinate geometry, and learn how to put the two together: equations representing geometry. By which I mean, being able to write down equations for geometric objects and manipulate the equations to get them into different useful forms, and to compute useful things. A first example would be studying different ways of writing down equations for the line [1], and then learn how each of the forms relate, how to use algebra to move between them, and what each for is useful for. For example finding the intersection of two lines involves simultaneously solving for (x,y) that satisfy both equations, and there's a particular form that is best suited to that. Another form is better if you want to \"move along a line\" say, parameterised by time. One form might be best for GPU rendering. Once you're comfortable with algebraic expressions for lines, then you can move on to the more complex curves that you listed -- the equations for these curves can be manipulated in analogous ways. EDIT: importantly you want to learn not how to \"plug and chug\" numbers, but instead how to use these equations in code: e.g. how would you use the equations to write code to draw a line/curve, and how to derive functions to intersect curves, connect curves at tangents, etc. There's more to it than that of course. For example working out equations for tangents to curves will become important. But start with the above. You mention de casteljau algorithm, I am not familiar with that, but it looks like it might be heading more into algebra, in particular manipulating polynomials, which you learn to write down in high-school, study more in pre-calculus and calculus, but can get pretty complicated, for example if you want to solve a quintic equation. Two elementary books: McDougal, Little, \"Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge\" Joseph H. Kindle, \"Theory and Problems of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry (Shaum's outline)\" The following are approachable, but don't directly address your interest in curves: Joseph O'Rourke, \"Computational Geometry in C,\" second edition (basics everyone should know, starts with primitives like knowing the best way to compute the intersection of two line segments. Christer Ericson, \"Real-time collision detection\" (a bit more specific, but a fantastic book, recommended to me here on HN in the past) And of course I must reference Inigo Quilez' [2] \"SDF of a ...\" videos which give an illuminating perspective on using equations to describe geometry[3].

          "text": "What you are trying to learn/understand falls under the rubric of Scientific Computing/Numerical Methods/Numerical Analysis/Numerical Algorithms. The mathematics underpinning them is quite wide but mostly Linear Algebra and Calculus. You might find the following useful for your study; 1) Scientific Computing by Michael Heath - Classic text covering a broad swath of domains and tries to build motivation/intuition before the mathematics (affordable Indian edition available). 2) Mathematical Principles for Scientific Computing and Visualization by Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford - Nice overview of needed background. The authors also have a book named Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox which you might find a ideal companion. 3) Numerical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Rajesh Kumar Gupta - A relatively recent book with a really broad coverage of subjects and detailed mathematical expositions (affordable Indian edition available). 4) Numerical Algorithms: Methods for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Graphics by Justin Solomon - Good explanations (affordable Indian edition available). Free ebook available at https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/ 5) Finally, Mathematics for Physicists: Introductory Concepts and Methods by Alexander Altland and Jan Von Delft is an excellent book to have as a reference. It has three sections viz. Linear Algebra, Calculus and Vector Calculus. The presentation is very precise, does not focus on proofs/lemmas but on concepts and covers a wide swath of important mathematics. reply",

After a flood of silver stolen from the \"New World\" arrived in Europe, it caused inflation.  Similar situations happen throughout history. I think the primary driver of economic growth is the distribution of opportunity throughout society. If a rentier class happens to capture governance, as is the case in Russia with the oligarchs, or in the US with our \"Tech Bros\" and hedge funds, social mobility, and the drive to improve one's station in life, is greatly diminished, and the economy becomes a zero sum game.

If a developer used to write 100 lines of code per day (illustrative) but now AI writes 90% of the code, so you'd think that the load will go down to 10 lines, right? What I find is that the scope has exploded. Developers are now able to crank 1000 lines per day total and while you may say that AI writes 90% of them we are still writing 100 lines of the hard stuff.<p>Every feature that seemed too expensive before is suddenly doable. Every prototype becomes production system. The bottleneck shifted from typing to thinking, but the thinking load just got 10x bigger. We have also single-handedly increased the demand of that 10% chunk which is not as easy to scale as machines.\nAm I the only one noticing this?</p></p></p></p></div>",

The \"Release Radar\" was the first thing I looked at on Friday mornings, and was a great way to keep up with favorited artists, and discover new related ones.<p>Today, it is full of AI generated trash. The trick I see is established artists used as the second in the list of collaborators, but in the first 5 seconds of a stream it is obvious this is false.<p>I suppose it's possible Spotify has a revenue driven interest to let this continue, given the number of articles I have seen about this trend. But when it comes to music, I am less inclined to be a community moderator of obvious spam. Allowing anyone to upload tracks under another band's name is a terrible idea.<p>My Spotify subscription won't be renewing in the next billing cycle, and in the meantime I'm looking into alternatives that provide a good, curated discovery feature.<p>Recommendations?</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

Intel and AMD were more desktop based so power efficiency wasnt the goal. When Apple's chips got so good they could transition into laptops, x86 wasn't in the same ballpark. Also the iPhone is the most lucrative product of all time (I think) and Apple poured a tonne of that money into R&D and taking the top engineers from Intel, AMD, and ARM, building one of the best silicon teams. reply",

Back when the M1's came out, many benchmarks showed virtualized Windows blowing the doors off of market-equivalent x86 CPUs. Also, there's the obvious benefits of being TSMC's best customer. And when you design a chip for low power consumption, that means you've got a higher ceiling when you introduce cooling. reply",

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "I used a 2019 MacBook Pro for quite a while, and it was my first (and so far only) dip into Apple-land. While I appreciated the really solid build quality, great screen, etc, the battery life was pretty abysmal. We're talking easily under 2 hours if I had to be in a video call, which basically meant taking a charger to any meeting of decent length. The 2nd biggest disappointment was when I ran my team's compute-heavy workload locally, expecting blistering performance from the i9, only to find that the CPU got throttled to under 50% (I seem to recall 47%, but my memory is fuzzy), within 6 seconds of starting the workload. And this was essentially a brand new laptop, so it likely wasn't blocked fan intakes. I fail to see the point of putting a CPU in a laptop that your thermal design simply can't handle. reply",

In real world applications, the little cores are next to useless because most applications prefer a few fast cores over many slow cores. reply",

Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial. I'd still much rather have Apple Silicon in my laptop. reply",

          "text": "For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon. In the server space, x86 has the highest performance right now. Yes. That's true. That's also because Apple does not make server parts. Look for Qualcomm to try to win the server performance crown in the next few years with their Oryon cores. That said, Graviton is at least 50% of all AWS deployments now. So it's winning vs x86. ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial. I think you'll have to define what top-end means and what performance engineering means. reply",

They just figure it out at their scale it would be cheaper to do it themselves. But I am purely guessing ARM has risen their price per core so it makes less financial sense to do a yearly update on CPU. They are also going into Server CPU business meaning they now have some incentives to keep it all to themselves. Which makes the Nvidia moves really smart as they decided to go for the ISA licences and do it by themselves. reply",

          "text": "I’ve posted about this problem before. It’s happened to me twice at two different companies. This is a legit problem. They pose as American citizens or permanent residents. Sometimes even using a VPN into the US. HR folks would not catch on. I’ve actually interviewed two of these people over the years. They somehow got through the initial screenings.\nIt’s a bizarre experience. Most of the time there is a significant delay with silence between your question and their answer. It’s as if they’re being fed the perfect answer. Problem is they could never answer or pretended to not understand any follow-up questions. You could always hear others in the background. One time I was given an answer that I had heard someone else in the room give just 2 minutes before. The question that really solidified my hunch was about their location. The applicants would always claim to be from a very small town somewhere in the US. In my two experiences I happened to know a lot about those towns. The first said they “really enjoyed the mountains” when I asked what brought them to a Houston suburb. When I asked the other applicant if they had any damage from the hurricane that went through St. Augustine, FL, they replied “What hurricane?” Now, neither of these people would have been hired even if they had stellar interviews as we do make use of background checks and verification services. This scheme really only works for third-party dev shops or desperate small companies. I’m glad this problem is getting more attention. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

          "text": "How about making a new game with help from your son (even if it’s ideas) and making some new memories? ;-) The problem I found is that a lot of the stuff I made is tied to the hardware, OS and SDKs I used to make and run it (especially PalmOS and J2ME stuff - although Apple is just as bad.) Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around. Or at least some virtual machine / runtime that could be ported to some new OS / platform. reply",

          "text": "I used to ask Stripe Atlas for this kind of service. Because they made it so easy to spin up a company in 2 weeks, I thought it would be helpful to shut down a company too. But alas they haven't done it. In general it was about $2,500 the last time I did it and only really needed a Lawyer to help file the final taxes and submit the paperwork to shut down to Delaware. Will be different if you have a company set up in a different state. Financial and Legal is the only thing you need to focus on. You can literally shut down the operations yourself. The key issue that I found is that there is no emotional support. It's hard mentally, spiritually, and ultimately emotionally. Sometimes it's hard to actually go through the motions, the actions, the steps you need to do. At least the legal part must be handled. You can literally keep the \"company\" as a personal asset and try to run it as a side-project or a hobby if you'd like. Many bootstrappers and indiehackers do that when they start a business. I found a good support network of people who understand what you're going through can help. A simple telegram group, or whatsapp group, or even an online forum here should be able to help you with the emotional roller coaster.   Feel free to express more about what you're going through and others might be able to share insights or just wallow in pity along with you. reply",

From this pov, AI is the best thing that has happened to my weekend coding. I code recreationally way more than before. Before AI, I would try a new language or framework, and I’d give up halfway because re-figuring out basic stuff for the umpteenth time is boring, it’s not fun at all.

No more googling obscure syntax or writing the same utility functions for the nth time. There's a real joy in focusing purely on the creative aspects again. But there's a catch. My role has shifted from writing code to managing the AI. It's like being the manager of a brilliant intern with zero memory. My day is now this constant cycle: 1. Crafting the perfect context window to prevent hallucinations\n2. Engineering the right prompt\n3. Context switching while waiting for responses\n4. Painstakingly reviewing the output for subtle but critical errors So has it killed my interest in programming? Partially. The craftsman's satisfaction of writing code has diminished. But it's sparked a new obsession: building better tooling. How do we reduce this cognitive load? How do we make AI-assisted development more structured and less chaotic? I'm wondering if others feel the same - has your passion just moved up the abstraction stack like mine has? reply",

I used to engage small purpose-built DSL's, languages, and systems because they were easy to adopt.  Now they're at a strong disadvantage for lack of AI coverage. 3. I focus a lot more on value to the customer; opportunity is now the limiting factor, so I have the product manager hat on most of the time.  So I actually do less coding, pruning almost everything that I used to do just to see if I could. 4. I do try harder problems and techniques, because with AI I can typically get to a MVP I can validate and iterate (i.e., it minimizes the stage where nothing is really working).  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it just gets blocked; it's more like hunting than gardening or building. Overall, it's made skills matter less and opportunity/connections matter more, and those are mostly outside my control.  That makes it generally de-powering because though I can do much more, the value of what I can do is diminished by a larger factor. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s). - First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship. - Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer. Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups. Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator ( https://github.com/OperatorFoundation ). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case. In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols. - The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term. I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space). reply",

Even if you can't broadcast from inside a territory you can broadcast from outside. It can be jammed but it is a tough cat and mouse game and jamming isn't precise. So when you jam there are causalities. Not to mention that jamming can be quite expensive. I'm not saying that makes the problem easy, but I'll say that jamming isn't a very strong defense. Though the bigger issue here is probably bandwith. It's hard to be both long range and data dense. There's probably easier ways to distribute this. Hell, both Koreas are known to transport different things via balloons. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia [1] It is also why projects like Tor and Signal get funding from RFA. Maybe the US doesn't want encrypted services here, but if anything, it's for the same reason they do want encrypted services in other countries. reply",

I understand the confusion though, this phrasing could be better. > your government can decide to block unknown protocols This does happen, though when I worked in the industry it wasn't common. Blocking of specific protocols was much more of an obstacle. > you should trick DPI into thinking it sees HTTPS. Unless your government decides to block HTTPS HTTPS blocking (typically based on either the presence of a specific SNI field value, or based on the use of the ESNI/ECH TLS extension) was prolific. I won't comment on whether this was effective or not in impeding efforts to get people in these places connected. I will say though, Operator's Replicant does something similar to what you're describing in that it can mimic unrelated protocols.

Predictably this means there's no one-size-fits-all solution to circumventing censorship on the Chinese internet, and research into this area's difficult since China has both the technical means to identify violations very efficiently as well as the bureaucratic infrastructure to carry out enforcement actions against a considerable portion of those people who violate the GFW rules (with enforcement action being anything from a \"cooldown period\" on your internet connection where you can't make any connections for some amount of time between minutes and days, fines, or imprisonment depending on the type of content you were trying to access).

          "text": "DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized). It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself. A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now. In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry. reply",

The adversary can invisibly (to victim PoV) modify traffic if they have a cooperating rootPKI cert (anywhere in the ecosystem) that isn't the originating content provider, so long as they recognize the network signature (connection handshake); solely by terminating encryption early. Without a cert, you can still listen in with traffic analysis, the fetched traffic that's already been encrypted with their key (bit for bit), as known plaintext the math quickly reduces. SNI and a few other artifacts referencing the resources/sites are not part of the encrypted payload. Its more commonly known in a crypto context, but that kind of attack can happen anywhere.

It was explained to me that its just another version of MITM, the only difference is the number of resilient paths that need to be compromised. Eclipse type of attacks focus on compromising multiple nodes and most deal with breaking consensus algorithmic based software, which is quite common of blockchain, but that isn't the only place. TL;DR \nIn a single path graph you have MITM, in a N-path graph of connectivity you have Eclipse. Two heads of the same coin. Loosely I guess it would be considered an adversarial network partition at the ASN/BGP level. For active attacks you'd have to broadcast improperly, but for regional attacks at the ASN level you just have to be positioned correctly passively. That's why the whole AT&T room for the NSA back in the day was such a  big deal. A lot of these attacks have been known about for a long time. For instance, the same kind of attack could easily be done by compromising firmware within 1-step away from edge devices (Modems/Routers/ISP TFTP servers). Quite a lot of what was in the nationstate war-chest 10 years ago has been leaked, and is actively being used by non-state actors at this point. Its mad how sophisticated things are now. On some campuses, its not unheard of to see drones flying by to hack the radio logitech keyboards of campus computers; where they try to drop malware OTA through a powershell or tty keyboard spawned terminal prompt.

          "text": "I just spent 3 months in China this summer. The GFW has become much more sophisticated than I remember. I found only one method that reliably worked. That was to use Holafly (an international eSIM provider) and use its built-in VPN. China largely doesn’t care if foreigners get around the GFW, I guess. Another method that usually worked was ProtonVPN with protocol set to Wireguard. Not sure why this worked, it’s definitely a lot more detectable than other methods I tried. But as long as I rotated which US server I used every few days, this worked fine. No luck with shadowsocks, ProtonVPN “stealth” mode, Outline+Digital Ocean, or even Jump / Remote Desktop. Jump worked the longest at several hours before it became unbearably slow, I’m still not sure if I was actually throttled or my home computer started misbehaving. I didn’t get around to setting up a pure TLS proxy, or proxying traffic through a domain that serves “legitimate” traffic, so no idea if that still works. reply",

          "text": "> I have done math classes What classes? It's a bit hard to suggest what is appropriate without understanding where you currently are. > to brush up. But I think this might be the wrong approach. Especially for these topics. Instead of learning the minimum you need to just understand a specific algorithm, you should understand what the symbols mean, what they are doing, and how they are interacting with one another. Math is a language. But it is a language designed for precision. A big part of why I'm saying this is because at their core, these are not difficult equations from a computational perspective. You really just need to understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My point is that the hard part about math often isn't the calculation part. Let's take B-Splines for an example and look at what Wiki says > A B-spline is defined as a piecewise polynomial of order n, meaning a degree of n − 1. Either this is simple or incomprehensible, so let's break it down. What does piecewise mean? Here's an example piecewise function. a     if x > 0\n  f(x) = {0     x = 0\n          b     if x < 0 Given you're on HN and looking at computer graphics, I take it you're familiar with if statements? That's the same thing here. Let's translate. Looking at things from a different perspective can really help. if x > 0:\n    return a\n  else if x < 0:\n    return b\n  else: # x == 0\n    return 0 We should think of x as a location and we're just describing something about that location. Here's another piecewise function, but now in everyday English: \"Across the street all the houses end in even numbers, but on my side of the street all the houses are odd.\" There's always more ways to look at something. If you can't see what something means from this angle, try another. Be that another book teaching the same thing or another framework to describe the same thing. Get multiple perspectives. One will make more sense than another but which one that is tends to be personal. \"polynomial of order n\" A polynomial is an equation like a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n}. Sorry, let me rewrite that: a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n} Now in code for i in range(n):\n      sum += a[i] * math.pow(x, i) But we should break this down more, just like before. What is a_0? It is just a number. What does this represent? A point. What is a_1*x? That's a line. x is an arbitrary location. The a_1 is a scaling factor. So if a_1 is the number 2, then what our x is representing is all numbers (..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...} (is that all my neighbors across the street?) The a_2 x^2 is a curve, specifically a parabola. We can do the same thing. But also remember we're summing them together. So you have a point, a line, and a parabola. When you add them together you get something that is none of those things. What is really important here is that these functions you are interested in have a really critical property. They can be used to approximate almost anything. That almost part is really important, but you're going to have to dig deeper. My point here is that take time to slow down. Don't rush this stuff. I promise you that if you take time to slow down then the speed will come. But if you try to go too fast you'll just end up getting stuck. This is tricky stuff. When learning it doesn't always make a ton of sense and unfortunately(?) when you do understand it it is almost obvious. Think of the slowing down part like making a plan. In a short race you should just take off running without thinking. But if it is longer then you will go faster if you first plan and strategize. It is the same thing here and I promise you this isn't a short race. You don't win a marathon by winning a bunch of consecutive sprints. The only thing you win by trying that is a trip to the hospital. So slow down. Break problems apart. Find one part you think is confusing and focus on that. If it all seems confusing then try to walk through and force yourself to say why it is confusing. Keep doing this until you have something you understand. It is an iterative process. It'll feel slow, but I promise it pays dividends. Any complex problem can be broken down into a bunch of small problems[0] You got this! [0] This sentence doesn't just apply to how to figure things out, it applies directly to what you're trying to do and why you want these functions. If it doesn't make sense now, revisit, it will later. reply",

In particular; the idea of breaking down a polynomial as a sum of terms, mapping each term to a graphical view (i.e. analytic to coordinate geometry) and then realizing such a sum of terms can be a complex curve (i.e. a complex graphical view) which can be an approximation of almost any function. The teaching of mathematics has become so abstract that students are not taught how to map it to geometry which is THE way to build intuition. You can understand a lot by just imagining 2D/3D mappings before generalizing to n-dimensional vector spaces.

While I'm a big fan of visualization I must also stress that it can equally be misleading. It's to make mistakes because you can only visualize anything above 3D like a blind man can describe an elephant[0]. It can be useful but it is also common to get caught up in one aspect while ignoring the rest. The trouble is you're not ignoring because you're rejecting what's there, you're ignoring because you can't see it and it is really hard to see it. I also think there's this misnomer of being good at geometry or good at algebra. I lied about math being a language. It is a family of languages. It's good to be able to speak several of these languages, just like it is beneficial to be able to program in multiple languages. The best language is only the best one in a certain context, but technically any of them will work. That's why I suggest multiple perspectives. I'll even say that programming is one of those math languages ;) [0] https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F... reply",

You should always feel a bit uncomfortable in high dimensions least you be lulled into a false sense of security. In fact, this is frequently a pain point for people as they advance. They over leveraged the utility of visualization and hit a wall abstracting those same concepts to domains where you can't do any visualization. Just look at how many people claim to be able to visualize the 4th dimension and point at a tesseract. I'm not disagreeing imagination and visualization aren't critical tools. They are. But read my comment again like a mathematician. If you misread you'll overfit the wrong concept. reply",

None of your cautions are really that big of an impediment in practice and i would not want students to take away the wrong message from these comments. Mathematicians/Practitioners know when to switch from simple geometry to algebra and that is taught as a matter of course. As an example, the farin and hansford book Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox that i mention at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45060305 precisely takes this approach starting with visualizing vectors in 2D/3D geometry and then moving on to higher-dimensions.

          "text": "It's a bit difficult to say, since some of those textbooks (e.g. Shirley) cover preliminary math topics as well. It sounds like you need to get a stronger understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and approach maths from a healthier viewpoint. Something like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right often forces people to treat linear algebra with the slow care it requires, but this may be a bit too extreme. Now that you have some applications in mind, write down all of the terms and concepts that are involved that you don't understand. Go back to a first-year textbook, something like Stewart's Calculus is probably ideal since it is designed to work up to e.g. Bezier curves. However, this time, I would not suggest relying on the exercises for understanding. Instead, place strong emphasis on the definitions and theorems, drawing them together into a diagram with the terms from earlier to really understand why each concept is required for another concept. Your objective should be to see how these ideas lead to the definition of those curves, and why it has to be that way. Be skeptical and try thinking of alternatives; you might find them to have issues, or coincide with what has already been found! Make sure you understand each concept first before you apply it; this will not be a fast process, and if you need to check something, be sure to do it. But thinking in the context of what you want to learn later is often helpful, I find. There are other, more detailed guides out there, mostly geared toward higher level math, e.g. https://www.susanrigetti.com/math and you might find the early parts of these useful too. Also, I have found chatbots to be reasonable at giving tailored explanations for a given topic, so there is rarely harm in using them to supplement your learning. Just don't use them to solve problems for you. reply",

          "text": "It sounds like you've got something specific in mind when you say, \"modeling\". The term modeling is used in a lot of different situations to mean different things. For example, it could mean to make a 3d model in Blender, it could mean to pose for someone to paint you or to take a photo, with databases it's used to mean modeling the data, with statistics it's used to mean finding a way to simply represent and reason about the data (create a model of it). The things you've listed out make me guess you want to write 2d or 3d image rendering software. Is that right? If that's the case, there's no substitute for trying to recreate certain algorithms or curves using a language or tool that you're comfortable with. It'll help you build an intuition about how the mathematical object behaves and what problems it solves (and doesn't). All of these approaches were created to solve problems, understanding the theory of it doesn't quite get you there. If you don't have a good place to try out functions, I recommend https://thebookofshaders.com/05/ , https://www.desmos.com/calculator , or https://www.geogebra.org/calculator . A good place to start is linear interpolation (lerp). It seems dead simple, but it's used extensively to blend two things together (say positions or colors) and the other things you listed are mostly fancier things built on top of linear interpolation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation For bezier curves and surfaces here are some links I've collected over the years: https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/ https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.... http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=730 https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/drawings.html https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatt... A final note: a lot of graphics math involves algebra. Algebra can be fun, but it also can be frustrating and tedious, particularly when you're working through something large and make a silly mistake and the result doesn't work. I suggest using sympy to rearrange equations or do substitutions and so on. It can seem like overkill but as soon as you save a few hours debugging it's worth it. It also does differentiation and integration for you along with simplifying equations. https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/intro... reply",

          "text": "For geometry, start with high-school algebra and coordinate geometry, and learn how to put the two together: equations representing geometry. By which I mean, being able to write down equations for geometric objects and manipulate the equations to get them into different useful forms, and to compute useful things. A first example would be studying different ways of writing down equations for the line [1], and then learn how each of the forms relate, how to use algebra to move between them, and what each for is useful for. For example finding the intersection of two lines involves simultaneously solving for (x,y) that satisfy both equations, and there's a particular form that is best suited to that. Another form is better if you want to \"move along a line\" say, parameterised by time. One form might be best for GPU rendering. Once you're comfortable with algebraic expressions for lines, then you can move on to the more complex curves that you listed -- the equations for these curves can be manipulated in analogous ways. EDIT: importantly you want to learn not how to \"plug and chug\" numbers, but instead how to use these equations in code: e.g. how would you use the equations to write code to draw a line/curve, and how to derive functions to intersect curves, connect curves at tangents, etc. There's more to it than that of course. For example working out equations for tangents to curves will become important. But start with the above. You mention de casteljau algorithm, I am not familiar with that, but it looks like it might be heading more into algebra, in particular manipulating polynomials, which you learn to write down in high-school, study more in pre-calculus and calculus, but can get pretty complicated, for example if you want to solve a quintic equation. Two elementary books: McDougal, Little, \"Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge\" Joseph H. Kindle, \"Theory and Problems of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry (Shaum's outline)\" The following are approachable, but don't directly address your interest in curves: Joseph O'Rourke, \"Computational Geometry in C,\" second edition (basics everyone should know, starts with primitives like knowing the best way to compute the intersection of two line segments. Christer Ericson, \"Real-time collision detection\" (a bit more specific, but a fantastic book, recommended to me here on HN in the past) And of course I must reference Inigo Quilez' [2] \"SDF of a ...\" videos which give an illuminating perspective on using equations to describe geometry[3]. [1] https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/... [2] https://iquilezles.org/ [3] SDF of a Line https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMltMdi1Wzg EDIT: some of the IRC servers have #math channels, and some of those are open to drop ins asking questions like yours (others seem to be full of people studying for exams). reply",

The mathematics underpinning them is quite wide but mostly Linear Algebra and Calculus. You might find the following useful for your study; 1) Scientific Computing by Michael Heath - Classic text covering a broad swath of domains and tries to build motivation/intuition before the mathematics (affordable Indian edition available). 2) Mathematical Principles for Scientific Computing and Visualization by Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford - Nice overview of needed background. The authors also have a book named Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox which you might find a ideal companion. 3) Numerical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Rajesh Kumar Gupta - A relatively recent book with a really broad coverage of subjects and detailed mathematical expositions (affordable Indian edition available). 4) Numerical Algorithms: Methods for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Graphics by Justin Solomon - Good explanations (affordable Indian edition available). Free ebook available at https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/ 5) Finally, Mathematics for Physicists: Introductory Concepts and Methods by Alexander Altland and Jan Von Delft is an excellent book to have as a reference. It has three sections viz. Linear Algebra, Calculus and Vector Calculus. The presentation is very precise, does not focus on proofs/lemmas but on concepts and covers a wide swath of important mathematics. reply",

My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

          "text": "A huge reason for the low power usage is the iPhone. Apple spent years incrementally improving efficiency and performance of their chips for phones. Intel and AMD were more desktop based so power efficiency wasnt the goal. When Apple's chips got so good they could transition into laptops, x86 wasn't in the same ballpark. Also the iPhone is the most lucrative product of all time (I think) and Apple poured a tonne of that money into R&D and taking the top engineers from Intel, AMD, and ARM, building one of the best silicon teams. reply",

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "I used a 2019 MacBook Pro for quite a while, and it was my first (and so far only) dip into Apple-land. While I appreciated the really solid build quality, great screen, etc, the battery life was pretty abysmal. We're talking easily under 2 hours if I had to be in a video call, which basically meant taking a charger to any meeting of decent length. The 2nd biggest disappointment was when I ran my team's compute-heavy workload locally, expecting blistering performance from the i9, only to find that the CPU got throttled to under 50% (I seem to recall 47%, but my memory is fuzzy), within 6 seconds of starting the workload. And this was essentially a brand new laptop, so it likely wasn't blocked fan intakes. I fail to see the point of putting a CPU in a laptop that your thermal design simply can't handle. reply",

Another thing that makes Apple laptops feel way more efficient is that they use a true big.Little design while AMD and Intel's little cores are actually designed for area efficiency and not power efficiency. In the case of Intel, they stuff as many little cores as possible to win MT benchmarks. In real world applications, the little cores are next to useless because most applications prefer a few fast cores over many slow cores. reply",

Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel.

It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

          "text": "For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon. In the server space, x86 has the highest performance right now. Yes. That's true. That's also because Apple does not make server parts. Look for Qualcomm to try to win the server performance crown in the next few years with their Oryon cores. That said, Graviton is at least 50% of all AWS deployments now. So it's winning vs x86. ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial. I think you'll have to define what top-end means and what performance engineering means. reply",

          "text": "I dont think the point Amazon uses ARM was about performance but purely cost optimisation. At one point, nearly 40% of Intel's server revenue was coming from Amazon. They just figure it out at their scale it would be cheaper to do it themselves. But I am purely guessing ARM has risen their price per core so it makes less financial sense to do a yearly update on CPU. They are also going into Server CPU business meaning they now have some incentives to keep it all to themselves. Which makes the Nvidia moves really smart as they decided to go for the ISA licences and do it by themselves. reply",

After not finding anything for a long while finally found something close that will work for me: Docsify[1]. Docsify is git-backed but not a static site generator. Instead it reads the markdown as-is and renders to HTML/DOM (don't know the details) in the browser. I had 2 problems with it, first the sidebar wasn't convenient to edit/update, which I handled by creating a tags: `name` `name` annotation convention. The second was it didn't work for private github repos, which was solved by using Cloudflare Pages to auto-publish changes from git. Effectively now it has a 'build' step like a static-site-generator but it's only to write _sidebar.md from the tagged *.md files.

          "text": "I spent some time searching for a good wiki a few months ago. It depends on your use case. The simplest and oldest wiki might be Docuwiki. There is no database, and organization is based on text files in folders. You can make decent wikis with it, but it’s minimalist and can be hard for the users to use it. Then we have enterprise solutions for collaboration by Microsoft, Google, Atlassian, etc. They can’t be used in our workplace, due to organization policy. I went with Bookstack for a wiki to be used by a group of people. The interface and fonts are pretty, it’s super fast, installation is easy, and automatic updates have been problem free so far. The content must be organized in terms of shelves/books/chapters/pages, but some people want any number of categories and titles.\nIt doesn’t allow a lot of customization, but the choices made are OK. Mediawiki is complex, and takes more time to administer. It could make sense for large number of users. I stopped using it after upgrades broke the installation a few times, and, frankly, the interface looks outdated to me in most themes, and needs customization which takes time. Obviously, it’s very customizable, there are tons of resources and we know it can scale to billions of people! reply",

If a developer used to write 100 lines of code per day (illustrative) but now AI writes 90% of the code, so you'd think that the load will go down to 10 lines, right? What I find is that the scope has exploded. Developers are now able to crank 1000 lines per day total and while you may say that AI writes 90% of them we are still writing 100 lines of the hard stuff.<p>Every feature that seemed too expensive before is suddenly doable. Every prototype becomes production system. The bottleneck shifted from typing to thinking, but the thinking load just got 10x bigger. We have also single-handedly increased the demand of that 10% chunk which is not as easy to scale as machines.\nAm I the only one noticing this?</p></p></p></p></div>",

The code that even ChatGPT generates is usually just as well structured using good software practices as I would have done - and I’ve been in the field professionally since 1996. The only work I do manually is moving functions out into their own libraries and telling it to use my libraries to reduce duplicate code. It’s going to hurt junior devs the most.  I still have to do the higher level design work and tease out requirements. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

I'm away from home so can't open up my NAS and look) so not worth my time to optimize it. On the flip side it's fun to randomly browse through and take a trip down memory lane.

There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

My truck is old, damaged, unwashed (and seldom driven), so the traffic light beggars mostly self-deny since mine is usually the ugliest vehicle at the light. Earlier this year it was a holiday weekend, IIRC maybe Easter and it might have been the Saturday afternoon after Good Friday.  I pull up and recognize the guy in the median from a few times earlier, but this time I'm going to turn left, and pulled up to the red light first in line with the dude right next to me.  There's about half a dozen other cars he approaches, and comes back while the light is still red.  With the looks of my truck people figure I couldn't afford a better vehicle and I don't blame them.  He says \"Well I'm doing pretty good today but not like yesterday, that was $900.00\". No way he was lying to me at that time, he was prouly sharing news of his good fortune that he would never tell anyone else. That was one choice spot. reply",

Sometimes even using a VPN into the US. HR folks would not catch on. I’ve actually interviewed two of these people over the years. They somehow got through the initial screenings.\nIt’s a bizarre experience. Most of the time there is a significant delay with silence between your question and their answer. It’s as if they’re being fed the perfect answer. Problem is they could never answer or pretended to not understand any follow-up questions. You could always hear others in the background. One time I was given an answer that I had heard someone else in the room give just 2 minutes before. The question that really solidified my hunch was about their location. The applicants would always claim to be from a very small town somewhere in the US. In my two experiences I happened to know a lot about those towns. The first said they “really enjoyed the mountains” when I asked what brought them to a Houston suburb. When I asked the other applicant if they had any damage from the hurricane that went through St. Augustine, FL, they replied “What hurricane?” Now, neither of these people would have been hired even if they had stellar interviews as we do make use of background checks and verification services. This scheme really only works for third-party dev shops or desperate small companies. I’m glad this problem is getting more attention. reply",

After a flood of silver stolen from the \"New World\" arrived in Europe, it caused inflation.  Similar situations happen throughout history. I think the primary driver of economic growth is the distribution of opportunity throughout society. If a rentier class happens to capture governance, as is the case in Russia with the oligarchs, or in the US with our \"Tech Bros\" and hedge funds, social mobility, and the drive to improve one's station in life, is greatly diminished, and the economy becomes a zero sum game.

My question is what will be the function of the \"sum part\" as a society builds all technologies to 'completion' which is defined as when the utility of any new technology approaches zero because there is nothing 'valuable' or 'new to invent'. A different argument is that as technology improves to infinity, wealth also becomes ubiquitous and potentially infinite. So even though no new technology is invented that is valuable, there is infinite wealth through abundance. It seems to me that the primary driver of which world we end up in is whether humanity is able to become multi-planetary. Otherwise, resources become a constraint and instead of discovering new existing resources, humanity can only create value by inventing new technology. These are not strong opinions. reply",

See: https://lithus.eu We saw that companies were hesitant to deploy on bare metal because of: risk of project failure, need to retrain, need to hire, and general fear of unmanaged hardware. So we did the math and realised that for half the price of AWS we could provide the infra /and/ provide the DevOps engineering time to support their software developers. We'd already built the IP to do this over the proceeding years anyway. So we're definitely a services company rather than a product company, but we are actually doing this in a really meaningful way. We migrate people out of AWS (et al), then operate their infra and become their DevOps team. And now we have some very happy customers!

          "text": "The iPad 2 can be downgraded to iOS 6.1.3 or 8.4.1. Both offer better performance than iOS 9 and have untethered jailbreaks. Once downgraded and jailbroken you can sideload hours and hours worth of games. A lot from that era are IAP-free. I use an iPhone 5 downgraded to iOS 6 (tethered) as an iPod. I love how I can unplug my headphones from my work Mac, plug directly into the phone (no adapter required!) and it effectively mutes Slack without actually muting it. Syncing with the latest version of iTunes still works, albeit slowly. I also use an iPad 4 (tethered to iOS 6) as an ebook. iBooks works great and I love the pseudomorphic design.

          "text": "Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s). - First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship. - Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer. Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups. Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator ( https://github.com/OperatorFoundation ). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case. In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols. - The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term. I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space). reply",

Even if you can't broadcast from inside a territory you can broadcast from outside. It can be jammed but it is a tough cat and mouse game and jamming isn't precise. So when you jam there are causalities. Not to mention that jamming can be quite expensive. I'm not saying that makes the problem easy, but I'll say that jamming isn't a very strong defense. Though the bigger issue here is probably bandwith. It's hard to be both long range and data dense. There's probably easier ways to distribute this. Hell, both Koreas are known to transport different things via balloons. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia [1] It is also why projects like Tor and Signal get funding from RFA. Maybe the US doesn't want encrypted services here, but if anything, it's for the same reason they do want encrypted services in other countries. reply",

I understand the confusion though, this phrasing could be better. > your government can decide to block unknown protocols This does happen, though when I worked in the industry it wasn't common. Blocking of specific protocols was much more of an obstacle. > you should trick DPI into thinking it sees HTTPS. Unless your government decides to block HTTPS HTTPS blocking (typically based on either the presence of a specific SNI field value, or based on the use of the ESNI/ECH TLS extension) was prolific. I won't comment on whether this was effective or not in impeding efforts to get people in these places connected. I will say though, Operator's Replicant does something similar to what you're describing in that it can mimic unrelated protocols. It's a clever approach, unfortunately it was a bit immature when I was working in that area so the team didn't adopt it while I was around. reply",

Predictably this means there's no one-size-fits-all solution to circumventing censorship on the Chinese internet, and research into this area's difficult since China has both the technical means to identify violations very efficiently as well as the bureaucratic infrastructure to carry out enforcement actions against a considerable portion of those people who violate the GFW rules (with enforcement action being anything from a \"cooldown period\" on your internet connection where you can't make any connections for some amount of time between minutes and days, fines, or imprisonment depending on the type of content you were trying to access).

That was to use Holafly (an international eSIM provider) and use its built-in VPN. China largely doesn’t care if foreigners get around the GFW, I guess. Another method that usually worked was ProtonVPN with protocol set to Wireguard. Not sure why this worked, it’s definitely a lot more detectable than other methods I tried. But as long as I rotated which US server I used every few days, this worked fine. No luck with shadowsocks, ProtonVPN “stealth” mode, Outline+Digital Ocean, or even Jump / Remote Desktop. Jump worked the longest at several hours before it became unbearably slow, I’m still not sure if I was actually throttled or my home computer started misbehaving. I didn’t get around to setting up a pure TLS proxy, or proxying traffic through a domain that serves “legitimate” traffic, so no idea if that still works. reply",

It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself. A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now. In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry. reply",

The authors also have a book named Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox which you might find a ideal companion. 3) Numerical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Rajesh Kumar Gupta - A relatively recent book with a really broad coverage of subjects and detailed mathematical expositions (affordable Indian edition available). 4) Numerical Algorithms: Methods for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Graphics by Justin Solomon - Good explanations (affordable Indian edition available). Free ebook available at https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/ 5) Finally, Mathematics for Physicists: Introductory Concepts and Methods by Alexander Altland and Jan Von Delft is an excellent book to have as a reference. It has three sections viz. Linear Algebra, Calculus and Vector Calculus.

          "text": "> I have done math classes What classes? It's a bit hard to suggest what is appropriate without understanding where you currently are. > to brush up. But I think this might be the wrong approach. Especially for these topics. Instead of learning the minimum you need to just understand a specific algorithm, you should understand what the symbols mean, what they are doing, and how they are interacting with one another. Math is a language. But it is a language designed for precision. A big part of why I'm saying this is because at their core, these are not difficult equations from a computational perspective. You really just need to understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My point is that the hard part about math often isn't the calculation part. Let's take B-Splines for an example and look at what Wiki says > A B-spline is defined as a piecewise polynomial of order n, meaning a degree of n − 1. Either this is simple or incomprehensible, so let's break it down. What does piecewise mean? Here's an example piecewise function. a     if x > 0\n  f(x) = {0     x = 0\n          b     if x < 0 Given you're on HN and looking at computer graphics, I take it you're familiar with if statements? That's the same thing here. Let's translate. Looking at things from a different perspective can really help. if x > 0:\n    return a\n  else if x < 0:\n    return b\n  else: # x == 0\n    return 0 We should think of x as a location and we're just describing something about that location. Here's another piecewise function, but now in everyday English: \"Across the street all the houses end in even numbers, but on my side of the street all the houses are odd.\" There's always more ways to look at something. If you can't see what something means from this angle, try another. Be that another book teaching the same thing or another framework to describe the same thing. Get multiple perspectives. One will make more sense than another but which one that is tends to be personal. \"polynomial of order n\" A polynomial is an equation like a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n}. Sorry, let me rewrite that: a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^{n} Now in code for i in range(n):\n      sum += a[i] * math.pow(x, i) But we should break this down more, just like before. What is a_0? It is just a number. What does this represent? A point. What is a_1*x? That's a line. x is an arbitrary location. The a_1 is a scaling factor. So if a_1 is the number 2, then what our x is representing is all numbers (..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...} (is that all my neighbors across the street?) The a_2 x^2 is a curve, specifically a parabola. We can do the same thing. But also remember we're summing them together. So you have a point, a line, and a parabola. When you add them together you get something that is none of those things. What is really important here is that these functions you are interested in have a really critical property. They can be used to approximate almost anything. That almost part is really important, but you're going to have to dig deeper. My point here is that take time to slow down. Don't rush this stuff. I promise you that if you take time to slow down then the speed will come. But if you try to go too fast you'll just end up getting stuck. This is tricky stuff. When learning it doesn't always make a ton of sense and unfortunately(?) when you do understand it it is almost obvious. Think of the slowing down part like making a plan. In a short race you should just take off running without thinking. But if it is longer then you will go faster if you first plan and strategize. It is the same thing here and I promise you this isn't a short race. You don't win a marathon by winning a bunch of consecutive sprints. The only thing you win by trying that is a trip to the hospital. So slow down. Break problems apart. Find one part you think is confusing and focus on that. If it all seems confusing then try to walk through and force yourself to say why it is confusing. Keep doing this until you have something you understand. It is an iterative process. It'll feel slow, but I promise it pays dividends. Any complex problem can be broken down into a bunch of small problems[0] You got this! [0] This sentence doesn't just apply to how to figure things out, it applies directly to what you're trying to do and why you want these functions. If it doesn't make sense now, revisit, it will later. reply",

While I'm a big fan of visualization I must also stress that it can equally be misleading. It's to make mistakes because you can only visualize anything above 3D like a blind man can describe an elephant[0]. It can be useful but it is also common to get caught up in one aspect while ignoring the rest. The trouble is you're not ignoring because you're rejecting what's there, you're ignoring because you can't see it and it is really hard to see it. I also think there's this misnomer of being good at geometry or good at algebra. I lied about math being a language. It is a family of languages. It's good to be able to speak several of these languages, just like it is beneficial to be able to program in multiple languages. The best language is only the best one in a certain context, but technically any of them will work. That's why I suggest multiple perspectives. I'll even say that programming is one of those math languages ;) [0] https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F... reply",

          "text": "I highly encourage you to talk to a mathematician about this stuff. In high dimensions everything is all about caveats and edge cases. Your {1,2,3}D intuition leads you astray rather than helps you closer to the answer. In fact, math is specifically an overly pedantic because nuances are so critical. I'll use an example that we can reason from low dimensions but that many people make the wrong connections. What is the probability that in N dimensions two i.i.d randomly drawn vectors are orthogonal? We can easily intuit in low dimensions that this is a pretty unlikely event. But in high dimensions exactly the opposite is true. An easy mistake to make is to not think about this question from a continuous perspective, by reframing the question to ask what the probability that the angle between to i.i.d drawn vectors are within some epsilon bound. If we don't, then the answer is trivial in all cases: 0. A good student would be able to reason through this from looking at the 2D case and 3D case but this is only a sample of 2 and it would be naive to generalize such a notion without doing the proof. So let's look at something a little harder. A classic problem is looking at the volume of a n-ball. Our 2D and 3D understanding make this problem look easy. The volume of the 3D ball is much larger than the 2D ball. We can even verify this my analytically solving the 4D case. Same with the 5D case! But that's when things go awry. For the unit n-ball, 5D is where the maximum volume is. By 10 dimensions you have less volume than our 2D case and by 20 dimensions your volume is quickly converging to 0. Now let's look at something wild. Consider a hypersphere with radius r inscribed within a hypercube with sides of length 2r, what proportion of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube for a given dimension D? This sounds like an absolutely dumb question if we use or 2D and 3D logic. What amount of the sphere is inside the cube? 100%! It's right there in the problem description! Right? But this is entirely wrong. As dimensionality increases, very quickly, ~0% of the hypersphere resides within the hypercube and this is all due to the fact that hypercubes and hyperspheres have very different representations in high dimensions. Yes, there is still visual understanding we can draw to help reason, but again, this requires us to look at the problem from a different vantage point (the key thing I stressed in my original post btw). We have to look at the dual of the problem and instead ask \"what is the ratio of the volume of a hypersphere to the volume of the hypercube it is inscribed within?\" This will help but there's also a reason I put this question after the previous one because we know that there is not a clean linear relationship here and that at least with the sphere the volume increases and then decreases. Our visual intuition only helps if we can recognize that the relationship has everything to do with the corners of the cube. It is easy to look at these 3 cases and see how visual intuition from low dimensions can help, but be careful about post hoc trivialization. It's easy when you know these things and after they have been told to you but they are not so clear when you're being presented with the problem. All 3 of these problems are deeply related to the nearest neighbor problem and the concentration of measure. Where we run into the problem that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish the nearest point to the furthest point. Leveraging our lower dimensional visualization can provide help but it is important to remember that they are a small part of the much larger story here. Which of course should make sense because as the dimensionality grows our 2D/3D slices of those are a smaller and smaller portion. This is why I referenced the blind man and the elephant. Not because you can't use visualization to aid you, but because to see the elephant there you have to sample that elephant at many different places. And just like the blind man, you don't know how big that elephant is and where things are changing. But this stuff isn't going to help with even more abstract concepts. Like how there is no division algebra in 3D and how the largest is represented via the Octonion. How by moving to quaternions we lose commutativity and how moving to octonions we lose associativity. These are very fundamental features of math that we are losing while moving to higher dimensions. So I'm not sure why you're pointing to Farin and Hansford's book. Their highly concentrated on low dimensions and only briefly discuss generalization at the very end. They miss many important concepts. Not because the book is poorly written but because they are far out of scope from what is being taught. My caution about high dimensional spaces does not mean I don't absolutely love Needham's books on Visual Differential Geometry and Forums or his book Visual Complex Analysis or even Carter's inspired Visual Group Theory. These are masterpieces and books I highly recommend. But it is about what is being communicated. We work frequently in lower dimensions and there is a wealth of information there. But this does not mean higher dimensions are not absolutely littered with pitfalls and paradoxes. The true study of high dimensional spaces is relatively new and drove people like Cantor and Boltzmann insane. Every small mistake that is easy to make in low dimensions becomes exponentially more important in high dimensions. Yes, there are dimensional reduction techniques and these help with varying degrees (utility being critically dependent upon the latent dimensionality of the data) but every single one of these comes with major concessions. There is often even very bad science performed due to this lack of understanding. Techniques like t-SNE and UMAP are routinely unknowingly abused to draw inaccurate conclusions about these spaces, as it is possible to perform nearly any clustering you wish (see Lior Pachter's Picasso). Even PCA is frequently abused in this area due to there being subtle assumptions being invalid on different problems. My point is: you absolutely should warn people that there are many pitfalls when dealing with high dimensions. Anyone brushing these differences off as inconsequential nuances is just ignorant of this rich space. I don't blame anyone for being unaware of these things because it requires some very complex mathematics to truly understand, and we're talking about math that the average scientist is never going to be introduced to. You likely won't even see this in a given science PhD. Not because it doesn't matter, but because it is just very difficult math. And we learn math through a game of telephone that is often hyper focused (not a great way to learn it tbh) reply",

Take the time to learn what the symbols are saying for whatever dialect you are using. It sounds like you're getting into geometric kernel programming for something like CAD. Go brush up on parametric equations, implicit vs explicit representations, and play around with simple spline examples. 2D is enough to get the idea. You'll need to know some basic calculus for this, as splines are usually constrained by the derivative at the node. You can get quite far with just Wikipedia, YouTube videos, some thinking, and some exploratory programming. Hell, throw AI in there as well. reply",

          "text": "It's a bit difficult to say, since some of those textbooks (e.g. Shirley) cover preliminary math topics as well. It sounds like you need to get a stronger understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and approach maths from a healthier viewpoint. Something like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right often forces people to treat linear algebra with the slow care it requires, but this may be a bit too extreme. Now that you have some applications in mind, write down all of the terms and concepts that are involved that you don't understand. Go back to a first-year textbook, something like Stewart's Calculus is probably ideal since it is designed to work up to e.g. Bezier curves. However, this time, I would not suggest relying on the exercises for understanding. Instead, place strong emphasis on the definitions and theorems, drawing them together into a diagram with the terms from earlier to really understand why each concept is required for another concept. Your objective should be to see how these ideas lead to the definition of those curves, and why it has to be that way. Be skeptical and try thinking of alternatives; you might find them to have issues, or coincide with what has already been found! Make sure you understand each concept first before you apply it; this will not be a fast process, and if you need to check something, be sure to do it. But thinking in the context of what you want to learn later is often helpful, I find. There are other, more detailed guides out there, mostly geared toward higher level math, e.g. https://www.susanrigetti.com/math and you might find the early parts of these useful too. Also, I have found chatbots to be reasonable at giving tailored explanations for a given topic, so there is rarely harm in using them to supplement your learning. Just don't use them to solve problems for you. reply",

          "text": "It sounds like you've got something specific in mind when you say, \"modeling\". The term modeling is used in a lot of different situations to mean different things. For example, it could mean to make a 3d model in Blender, it could mean to pose for someone to paint you or to take a photo, with databases it's used to mean modeling the data, with statistics it's used to mean finding a way to simply represent and reason about the data (create a model of it). The things you've listed out make me guess you want to write 2d or 3d image rendering software. Is that right? If that's the case, there's no substitute for trying to recreate certain algorithms or curves using a language or tool that you're comfortable with. It'll help you build an intuition about how the mathematical object behaves and what problems it solves (and doesn't). All of these approaches were created to solve problems, understanding the theory of it doesn't quite get you there. If you don't have a good place to try out functions, I recommend https://thebookofshaders.com/05/ , https://www.desmos.com/calculator , or https://www.geogebra.org/calculator . A good place to start is linear interpolation (lerp). It seems dead simple, but it's used extensively to blend two things together (say positions or colors) and the other things you listed are mostly fancier things built on top of linear interpolation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation For bezier curves and surfaces here are some links I've collected over the years: https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/ https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.... http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=730 https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/drawings.html https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatt... A final note: a lot of graphics math involves algebra. Algebra can be fun, but it also can be frustrating and tedious, particularly when you're working through something large and make a silly mistake and the result doesn't work. I suggest using sympy to rearrange equations or do substitutions and so on. It can seem like overkill but as soon as you save a few hours debugging it's worth it. It also does differentiation and integration for you along with simplifying equations. https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/intro... reply",

          "text": "For geometry, start with high-school algebra and coordinate geometry, and learn how to put the two together: equations representing geometry. By which I mean, being able to write down equations for geometric objects and manipulate the equations to get them into different useful forms, and to compute useful things. A first example would be studying different ways of writing down equations for the line [1], and then learn how each of the forms relate, how to use algebra to move between them, and what each for is useful for. For example finding the intersection of two lines involves simultaneously solving for (x,y) that satisfy both equations, and there's a particular form that is best suited to that. Another form is better if you want to \"move along a line\" say, parameterised by time. One form might be best for GPU rendering. Once you're comfortable with algebraic expressions for lines, then you can move on to the more complex curves that you listed -- the equations for these curves can be manipulated in analogous ways. EDIT: importantly you want to learn not how to \"plug and chug\" numbers, but instead how to use these equations in code: e.g. how would you use the equations to write code to draw a line/curve, and how to derive functions to intersect curves, connect curves at tangents, etc. There's more to it than that of course. For example working out equations for tangents to curves will become important. But start with the above. You mention de casteljau algorithm, I am not familiar with that, but it looks like it might be heading more into algebra, in particular manipulating polynomials, which you learn to write down in high-school, study more in pre-calculus and calculus, but can get pretty complicated, for example if you want to solve a quintic equation. Two elementary books: McDougal, Little, \"Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge\" Joseph H. Kindle, \"Theory and Problems of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry (Shaum's outline)\" The following are approachable, but don't directly address your interest in curves: Joseph O'Rourke, \"Computational Geometry in C,\" second edition (basics everyone should know, starts with primitives like knowing the best way to compute the intersection of two line segments. Christer Ericson, \"Real-time collision detection\" (a bit more specific, but a fantastic book, recommended to me here on HN in the past) And of course I must reference Inigo Quilez' [2] \"SDF of a ...\" videos which give an illuminating perspective on using equations to describe geometry[3].

My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

          "text": "A huge reason for the low power usage is the iPhone. Apple spent years incrementally improving efficiency and performance of their chips for phones. Intel and AMD were more desktop based so power efficiency wasnt the goal. When Apple's chips got so good they could transition into laptops, x86 wasn't in the same ballpark. Also the iPhone is the most lucrative product of all time (I think) and Apple poured a tonne of that money into R&D and taking the top engineers from Intel, AMD, and ARM, building one of the best silicon teams. reply",

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

Back when the M1's came out, many benchmarks showed virtualized Windows blowing the doors off of market-equivalent x86 CPUs. Also, there's the obvious benefits of being TSMC's best customer. And when you design a chip for low power consumption, that means you've got a higher ceiling when you introduce cooling. reply",

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

          "text": "I used a 2019 MacBook Pro for quite a while, and it was my first (and so far only) dip into Apple-land. While I appreciated the really solid build quality, great screen, etc, the battery life was pretty abysmal. We're talking easily under 2 hours if I had to be in a video call, which basically meant taking a charger to any meeting of decent length. The 2nd biggest disappointment was when I ran my team's compute-heavy workload locally, expecting blistering performance from the i9, only to find that the CPU got throttled to under 50% (I seem to recall 47%, but my memory is fuzzy), within 6 seconds of starting the workload. And this was essentially a brand new laptop, so it likely wasn't blocked fan intakes. I fail to see the point of putting a CPU in a laptop that your thermal design simply can't handle. reply",

In real world applications, the little cores are next to useless because most applications prefer a few fast cores over many slow cores. reply",

Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial. I'd still much rather have Apple Silicon in my laptop. reply",

          "text": "For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon. In the server space, x86 has the highest performance right now. Yes. That's true. That's also because Apple does not make server parts. Look for Qualcomm to try to win the server performance crown in the next few years with their Oryon cores. That said, Graviton is at least 50% of all AWS deployments now. So it's winning vs x86. ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial. I think you'll have to define what top-end means and what performance engineering means. reply",

          "text": "I dont think the point Amazon uses ARM was about performance but purely cost optimisation. At one point, nearly 40% of Intel's server revenue was coming from Amazon. They just figure it out at their scale it would be cheaper to do it themselves. But I am purely guessing ARM has risen their price per core so it makes less financial sense to do a yearly update on CPU. They are also going into Server CPU business meaning they now have some incentives to keep it all to themselves. Which makes the Nvidia moves really smart as they decided to go for the ISA licences and do it by themselves. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I developed a game called \"Putter King Adventure Golf\" for iOS and Android back in the 2010s. It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

          "text": "Three things that have bitten me recently: 1. beware of encryption, especially Microsoft and Apple. I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

After not finding anything for a long while finally found something close that will work for me: Docsify[1]. Docsify is git-backed but not a static site generator. Instead it reads the markdown as-is and renders to HTML/DOM (don't know the details) in the browser. I had 2 problems with it, first the sidebar wasn't convenient to edit/update, which I handled by creating a tags: `name` `name` annotation convention. The second was it didn't work for private github repos, which was solved by using Cloudflare Pages to auto-publish changes from git. Effectively now it has a 'build' step like a static-site-generator but it's only to write _sidebar.md from the tagged *.md files. You can see the start of my personal wiki/notes[2] which includes some info about Docsify and Cloudflare Pages & Access (transparently login-protect http paths) . Note the 'Edit' buttons (which open Github in edit mode) won't work (as you don't have access to private repo).

          "text": "I spent some time searching for a good wiki a few months ago. It depends on your use case. The simplest and oldest wiki might be Docuwiki. There is no database, and organization is based on text files in folders. You can make decent wikis with it, but it’s minimalist and can be hard for the users to use it. Then we have enterprise solutions for collaboration by Microsoft, Google, Atlassian, etc. They can’t be used in our workplace, due to organization policy. I went with Bookstack for a wiki to be used by a group of people. The interface and fonts are pretty, it’s super fast, installation is easy, and automatic updates have been problem free so far. The content must be organized in terms of shelves/books/chapters/pages, but some people want any number of categories and titles.\nIt doesn’t allow a lot of customization, but the choices made are OK. Mediawiki is complex, and takes more time to administer. It could make sense for large number of users. I stopped using it after upgrades broke the installation a few times, and, frankly, the interface looks outdated to me in most themes, and needs customization which takes time. Obviously, it’s very customizable, there are tons of resources and we know it can scale to billions of people! reply",

(or even interweaves paragraphs in with a different color for either language)<p>If you also have the MP3s of audiobooks -- the tool can optionally let you playback select portions of the text in either language.<p>Additional features like integration into a dictionary on click for word definitions, individual word pronunciation guides, synonyms etc would make it even more feature rich.<p>Is there already a tool or say a Calibre plug-in that does something like this already?

A great team earning < 20k a year is also bad. Keep in mind: In your early career phase nobody (not even good customers) will pay you a fortune without an exceptionally great idea, great planning and a good portion of luck. There is a lack of trust... you're unknown, hard to assess, etc. Building a stable and growing career based on knowledge is much \"healthier\" (literally) - less up and downs, more stability, more planning (instead of having luck). Earning too much money too early can cause great damage to your life. reply",

If a developer used to write 100 lines of code per day (illustrative) but now AI writes 90% of the code, so you'd think that the load will go down to 10 lines, right? What I find is that the scope has exploded. Developers are now able to crank 1000 lines per day total and while you may say that AI writes 90% of them we are still writing 100 lines of the hard stuff.<p>Every feature that seemed too expensive before is suddenly doable. Every prototype becomes production system. The bottleneck shifted from typing to thinking, but the thinking load just got 10x bigger. We have also single-handedly increased the demand of that 10% chunk which is not as easy to scale as machines.\nAm I the only one noticing this?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I’ve posted about this problem before. It’s happened to me twice at two different companies. This is a legit problem. They pose as American citizens or permanent residents. Sometimes even using a VPN into the US. HR folks would not catch on. I’ve actually interviewed two of these people over the years. They somehow got through the initial screenings.\nIt’s a bizarre experience. Most of the time there is a significant delay with silence between your question and their answer. It’s as if they’re being fed the perfect answer. Problem is they could never answer or pretended to not understand any follow-up questions. You could always hear others in the background. One time I was given an answer that I had heard someone else in the room give just 2 minutes before. The question that really solidified my hunch was about their location. The applicants would always claim to be from a very small town somewhere in the US. In my two experiences I happened to know a lot about those towns. The first said they “really enjoyed the mountains” when I asked what brought them to a Houston suburb. When I asked the other applicant if they had any damage from the hurricane that went through St. Augustine, FL, they replied “What hurricane?” Now, neither of these people would have been hired even if they had stellar interviews as we do make use of background checks and verification services. This scheme really only works for third-party dev shops or desperate small companies. I’m glad this problem is getting more attention. reply",
