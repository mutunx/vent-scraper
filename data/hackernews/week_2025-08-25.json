Just about the only thing I get from reading other people's code is the most egregious ways to not do something. This is a pretty common thing, a plurality of humans learn this way. We just have different standards for software, for some reason. We like to pretend books teach you something more \"real\" than just getting your hands dirty and writing some real fucked up code.

          "text": "The term \"design\" is ambiguous here. When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

          "text": "This has 2 key things: * \"well designed\": What was the objectives and ideas... * \"codebases\": How well that was implemented They are a lot of lofty claims saying how this or that is \"fast, secure, etc\" but don't end like that in the actual implementation. But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

          "text": "That would be quite clever for an incredibly horrible website. The other day my SO, who is a Turkish citizen, was filling up her visa application and after half an hour of meticulous form filling the system just kick her out. I think the session times out or something. If you haven't created an account or you haven't write down the current application ID everything is lost. In the process she was also directed to a non-.gov website for something during the process, I thought she was getting scammed but no. It actually makes sense to have a paid service that makes this abomination less painful. Though they work with VFS Global for collecting the applications and relevant documents, the VFS Global itself is an abomination and doesn't help with the handling of the form filling anyway. Recently EU streamlined the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens as those \"visa agencies\" that are the official agencies and the only way to apply for a visa for many countries don't actually help with anything and are scamming people by selling the \"good hours\" for the visa appointment on the black market. An agency was dropped for this and the scams by agencies were listed among the reasons to streamline the application process. Both with US and EU people are losing scholarships etc. due to outrageous wait times that are sometimes are years ahead or there's an issue with the systems handling the applications. I guess there must be an opportunity there to fix all this together with smaller stuff like handling transliteration and character encodings, I wonder if some of those scam site are not scams and actually help with it. An AI agent  can be useful here. reply",

I'll approximate the throttle by limiting chrome to 128kbps, 500ms delay, and 5% packet loss for fun. With a fresh incognito session, google responds to \"here to 4th street\" in 10 seconds, and when I click to open maps it needs just under two minutes to load.  Then I can click on the transit option and it needs another 10 seconds to update. Not too bad for a cold cache.  If I do it again with a hot cache it only takes 20 seconds to go through the whole process.  And I expect the app to be similar to the hot cache situation.  Even with 64kbps I'd expect reasonable results.  Do any cell providers throttle worse than that? I agree with your argument about bloat in general, but google in particular has a lot of good engineering resources and tries to work well on bad connections. Also I would be in favor of some spectrum licensing rules that say you can't throttle below 1Mbps... reply",

This is common.  Work begins on some web sites immediately after the election. For example, when a new president is sworn in, the White House web site flips immediately. More to the parent poster's point, it has been widely reported in the legitimate media repeatedly that many federal web sites have been replaced or significantly altered by the current administration.  There's an entire pseudo-department for it that also makes headlines for its greater transgressions. Add to that severe and sudden budget and staffing cuts, and like all government functions -- you get what you pay for. reply",

          "text": "Hi, about the Schengen visa situation in Turkey you can find articles like these that describe how the appointments are on the black market(In Turkish but I'm sure AI will do good job translating): https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5r2l43kn2o https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/22/vize-sorunu-kontrolden-cikt... On the social media the anecdotes differ but some say they were able to get the visa appointments bots, others say it was agency personel selling it to them under the table. Maybe its really the agency personel, or maybe it's people running bots to snap appointments and sell those pretending to be from the agency - can't know for sure but there are multiple services where people purchase appointments unofficially. In general the news situation in Turkey isn't very good as with the law enforcement but as you can see even BBC took notice. Generally speaking, these visa agencies are very unfriendly and unreachable. They seem to just collect the money, provide no personalized help at all. My GF had some questions about her US visa application, we were not able to reach VFS Global.  The phone numbers provided don't work, it's not even like taking long to speak with a human, the phone just gives you calling error. She previously used the same company for her Schengen visa for a company event in Paris, of course unreachable again and no appointments available. Because she works at a French corporation, she was able to ask a high ranking French person in the company who has a contact with the French embassy and they arranged the appointment shortly. reply",

Besides that, EU has \"green passport\" exception for the Turkish nationals, where they can travel visa-free on this kind of passport that is provided to individuals that meet certain criteria and millions of such passports were issued. The rejection rates are also not bad and EU has a \"return agreement\" with Turkey, which is designed to keep the middle eastern refugees in Turkey(essentially, if you come from Turkey EU can send you back to Turkey right away ).

To a first approximation, nobody who needs 500 servers is interested in 500 old servers and if they were they already bought 500 servers or are waiting for a better deal or aren’t ready to move out their 500 servers to make room. Recyclers have the real estate to receive 500 servers and experience disposing 500 servers. And there are not 500 hobbyists lined up…and who wants to deal with misinformed consumers? There are all sorts of incompatibility nuances with complex computer hardware. ——- Advice: If your hobby is gonna be training models, just build a box.

We don’t need to provoke just to indulge our worst instincts, but we also need tolerance for expressions that aren’t perfectly curated. That said, my article isn’t really about political correctness.

But you were also chastised for saying “you guys” -\n even though the women said as much as the men, if you didn’t put the proper pronouns under your profile.  I got chastised for saying “war room”.  I heard an anecdote that now “pow wow” wasn’t allowed. One podcast I listen to - Stuff You Should Know - replayed an old episode and added a disclaimer up front apologizing  because the episode was about pregnancy complications and in the older episode they were being “heteronormative” by not calling out that this issue only affects cisgendered women. I’m not saying anyone should be disrespected or I wouldn’t call someone by whatever name or pronoun they prefer. I also found all of the “ally” groups, discussion of “micro aggressions” etc groan worthy. This is in the DNCs charter https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-gender-non... > The language now says committees “shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1).”\nGender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, “and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided.” Yes I would find this just as bad if the language was about race and someone of mixed race heritage. I would much rather hang out with good live and let live traditional “guns and church family centered” old school Hank Hill conservatives (even though I’m not one), than the posturing “anti-racist” leftist wing. reply",

Nobody felt “silenced” by avoiding harmful words.\nThen came the hyperboles and the rigid rules you describe. To me, these are very similar to the poor-quality AI filters I discuss in my article: they judge without context. But judging requires more than scanning words—it requires understanding how, why, when, and under what circumstances something is said.\nWhat you’ve experienced—and thank you for sharing—is the result of bad, simplistic policy created by people who haven’t truly tried to understand or adapt. Human beings, societies, even nature itself, are complex systems. They can’t be reduced to mechanical yes/no rules.\nThat’s the heart of my article. And what I truly believe—as an eternal optimist—is that we can get to a place of smarter filters and smarter ways to coexist. It will take time, patience, and sincere effort.

When I need to find something, I do the same. I only use Google with queries for \"site:reddit.com\" or \"site:news.ycombinator.com\" to get opinions of real people on a particular manner. Now, before you jump on me saying that AI is wrong, this is true. But at the same time, I no longer can be 100% sure that whatever SEO optimized website I land at provides accurate information. If I need solid facts, I usually double check AI with various other sources. For queries like \"best keyboard for software engineers\", I'd rather get a table with pros/cons from AI rather than landing on whatever affiliate related website is promoted on Google. LLM gives me a good starting point to either dig deeper into particular products, or query further to find more suggestions. Same for coding. I used to Google \"how to split a string in ruby\" and land on flame war, or 19 years old, StackOverflow question. Now I can get an updated answer from whatever LLM you prefer with a reference to the official documentation. It works for simple queries, as well as code snippets. Lastly, I use LLMs to plan trips or gift ideas. I'd just throw in my preferences, and let LLM build a rough plan, from which I can iterate further, or start doing my own research. reply",

Letting the LLM handle the boilerplate and framework jargon lets me focus on the business logic and the design patterns, and helps me contribute much faster. But LLMs do often make mistakes so it's not like I blindly trust the output. They don't replace your colleagues in terms of being the ultimate source of truth.

For example, using tailwind, I can just describe in english what I want to happen with page elements and for the most part AI gets the code right, sometimes its wrong and I need to debug. A common argument I hear about AI is \"I could just write it faster myself\", well I know CompSci and general info about a lot of software things but it would take hours of getting up to speed on areas I'm not an expert in to be productive. I can just delegate that to AI and get mostly correct outputs, this is okay with me and faster than what I could do. I think the cost is going to catch up with the AI companies running the models (not the companies building products that call AI APIs) and that is when the bubble will burst. They will need to keep increasing costs and at some threshold, fewer and fewer developers in an organization will have licenses because it may become unaffordable. reply",

It’s best when the deal is a known quantity vs looking over “who’s hiring monthly HN posts”. I had 10-15 people i was working with (not all employed) at my last startup and they all came through my network either directly (ex colleagues) or through trusted parties. Again it’s mostly a trust thing more than anything. I think a good strategy is to get close to the kind of startups you care about without (before) direct intent to join. It’s easy to hang out (or at least it used to be) through various events, meetups or co-working places. Many startups I didn’t join and could have been good, I’ve met through open-source (Hadoop, HBase, Mesos, etc.) these are companies like Cloudera, DataBricks etc. when they were tiny. I still miss that crowd, years later. So it’s mostly a matter of being close to what’s happening, able to filter and ready to jump when opportunity arises. reply",

          "text": "1. Twitter: Founders and employees of early stage startups are often on twitter. 2. Portfolios of great angel investors and VC firms. 3. Emailing people you admire, eg investors, founders, or engineers. 4. Write down your friends and past and current colleagues who you think are a) most likely to be successful and b) you’d most enjoy working with. Or even just who you most like, trust, and admire. Then see where they work. And ask them about other companies they know. The simplest version of this is go on LinkedIn, and browse your network, and click to check out the companies all of your past classmates and colleagues work at. 5. Go to events that would have interesting technologists in your field (ie the areas where you have skill and taste, so you can pick who you admire), and ask them where they work, and which startups they’ve been impressed by. Talks, conferences, meetups, maker spaces. 6. Biased self-promotion: I’m kind of obsessed with interesting startups and sometimes share lists of startups, eg https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957834156794343730 and https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957446016950816866 7. HN who is hiring thread: there are lots of interesting ones there, you’ll just want to dig through to find them. 8. Look up university career fair company lists to see which companies are hiring, if they’re hiring new grads and interns then they’re very likely hiring senior engineers too. 9. Podcasts: some technologists have great podcasts, so do some investors and VC firms. 10. Search for startups founded by alumni from your school, you’re more likely to have alumni second degree connections there. I’ll note that investors get many bets, employees get one at a time. So you need a higher bar. Meeting in person is particularly high signal. My tip for filtering companies is to spend as much time as possible in person with the team before accepting an offer, ideally at least on 3+ separate occasions, with 3+ separate people. If there’s doubt, skip. This is also why it’s so good to start by identifying your most impressive friends and colleagues and see where they work, because you start with that high trust filter. reply",

          "text": "It’s a technique that will favor those skilled in BS — or more charitably, those skilled in social persuasion. And this is a risk for the founders, but there are plenty of cracked engineers who are also persuasive. The problem is they have little motivation to join a company with instability and looming uncertainty. So if the founders aren’t careful they’ll end up hiring someone more skilled at BS than any technical competency. I’ve been the founder in this position, and I’m confident in my ability to judge talent, so I don’t worry too much about the risk of hiring a BSer. I know that if I want to hire someone then they’re qualified. But at what price? Once I’ve decided I want to hire them, the cost of passing — and restarting the cycle — is too high to push back on high counteroffers, especially when the investors are pressuring us to hire fast. (fwiw, my next startup I will avoid raising any money until we have product/market fit… or at least I’ll tell the VCs pressuring me to hire too early to pound sand… this rushed hiring was a big contributor to the soft failure (acquihire), but I am proud we built a very strong team. For all our missteps and failures, hiring was not one of them.) reply",

          "text": "If you look at a lot of products out there that are basically what people want Siri to be (a truly integrated AI assistant), they either fall super flat (see rabbit r1) or are prohibitively expensive (see motion ai). Additionally, I think another one people forget is that Apple positioned itself with their marketing as the last bastion of privacy (I'm emphasizing marketing, not reality here), which gets contradicted with AI's current public perception. There's also the issue of choosing whether to keep things in the cloud or on device. One final major thing that I think Apple is considering: how could AI integration inadvertently cannibalize their app store profits?  If they're able to offer AI integration that other calendar, todo, etc. apps can't, how will that affect a user's purchasing decision?  If doing this would potentially eat into app store profits, then the next logical step is to create a system that allows developers to essentially have an API into the user's trained data, which is likely no small feat, especially if Apple is trying to obscure the data exposed to the app developer. reply",

Do they _want_ people using Siri?  Yes, it is actually a valuable feature for me to be able to get directions while driving or play a song while cooking.  Everything else has a weird cost-benefit ratio to Apple I imagine.  The things that make you think the iPhone is substantively more valuable because Siri can do them are hard.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It's the weekend. Let's do some brainstorming. What's forefront on your mind with regards to the human predicament, and how we move forward? \nWe all see that it seems pretty much everyone has gone insane, or at least that's what the narrative portrays. Why are companies, governments, and other organizations doing such stupid things? \nSo we've made machines that can appear to \"think\", by articulating linguistic constructs that make sense. In fact, there appears to be actual semantic and logical structure embedded within the neural networks of LLMs. Ok, let's keep our heads on straight, keep in mind the mathematics involved, chill out, and just think about what it is that we actually want (and what \"we\" are, for that matter). Are we going to someday transcend language? I'm aware that I'm typing this message out to you, using language, with hopes that this form of communication will become obsolete. But what will that look like? I know that human language in it's current form is severely limited. \nIf we're to design some future communication protocol and methodology, let's contemplate what types of things even need to be communicated? For example, what is \"the news\" nowadays? Could it be simply a video stream of the sunrise? Well it would take a long time to get there. In the meantime, it should probably be something like \"yeah, it's another day, and humans are doing the work necessary to put order to chaos and make things better for everyone\".<p>From a more concrete perspective, I'd say that we've reached the point when we can transcend the idea of what \"work\" is currently. We can see beyond the limited view of doing things for monetary profit, and see that certain systems could be implemented much better if there were certain forms of entity-organization and resource-allocation at play. What is a company if it's ran by a computer? What does it serve? I mean, it sounds silly to suggest some big companies with overlapping domains of operation should consolidate their operations, but we all know that that's where things should be headed in many cases.<p>So yeah, what's your vision for the future?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "My vision for the future includes greatly reducing the power requirements for AI by rethinking computing using first principles thinking. Every single attempt at this so far wasn't willing to go far enough, and ditch the CPU or RAM.  FPGAs got close, but they went insane with switching fabrics and special logic blocks. Now they've added RAM, which is just wrong. Edit/Append: I've had this idea [1] forever (since the 1990s, possibly earlier... don't have notes going that far back).  Imagine the simplest possible compute element, the look up table... arranged in a grid.  Architectural optimizations I've pondered over time lead me to a 4 bits in, 4 bits out look up table, with latches on all outputs and a clock signal. This prevents race conditions by slowing things down. The gain is that you can now just clock a vast 2d array of these cells with a 2 phase clock (like the colors on a chessboard) and it's a universal computer, Turing complete, but you can actually think about it without your brain melting down. The problem (for me) has always been programming it and getting a chip made.  Thanks to the latest \"vibe coding\" stuff, I've gotten out of analysis paralysis, and have some things cooking on the software front.  The other part is addressed by TinyTapeout, so I'll be able to get a very small chip made for a few hundred dollars. Because the cells are only connected to neighbors, the runs are all short, low capacitance, and thus you can really, REALLY crank up the clock rates, or save a lot of power. Because the grid is uniform, you wont have the hours or days long \"routing\" problems that you have with FPGAs. If my estimates are right, it will cut the power requirements for LLM computing by 95%.

On the superintelligence front, focusing on empathetic LLMs for companionship taps into real societal issues like rising loneliness (e.g. reports from the WHO highlight it as a global health threat).\nThis approach risks exacerbating dependency rather than alleviating it, potentially creating echo chambers of artificial interaction over genuine human bonds.

Honestly, I consider those two pretty different questions. At the very least, I'd approach them very differently in terms of time-scale. What's \"top of mind\" for me is more about the short-term threats I perceive to our way of life, whereas my \"vision for the future\" is - to my way of thinking - more about how I'd like things to be in some indeterminate future (that might never arrive, or might arrive long after my passing). To the first question then: what's on my mind? 1. The rise of authoritarianism and right-wing populism, both in the US and across the world. 2. The increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence systems, and the specter of continued advances exacerbating existing problems of unequal wealth / power imbalances / injustice / etc. Combine (1) and (2) and you have quite a toxic stew on your hands in the worst case. Now I'm not necessarily predicting the worst case, but I wouldn't bet money that I couldn't afford to lose against it either. So worst case, we wind up in a prototypical cyberpunk dystopia, or something close to it. Only probably less pleasant than the dystopias we are familiar with from fiction. And even if we don't wind up in a straight up \"cyberpunk dystopia\", one has to wonder what's going to happen if fears of AI replacing large numbers of white-collar jobs come true. And note that that doesn't have to happen tomorrow, or next year, or 5 years from now or whatever. If it happens 15 years, or 25 year, or 50 years, or whatever, from now, the impact could still be profound. So even for those of you who are dismissive of the capabilities of current AI systems, I encourage you to think about the big picture and play some mental simulations with different rates of change and different time scales. reply",

Backing out of setup on every startup is possible --- but it is often a multi-step process that becomes extremely annoying.

Smart TVs are actually cheaper --- which make no sense until you realize they are counting on recurring revenue from privacy invasion. They try to strong arm you into connecting the TV to the internet --- unless you run the TV in store demo mode. Also, the picture quality on lower ends models differ from the more expensive ones primarily because their bightness, contrast and color saturation controls are artificially limited --- except when run in store demo mode. So my solution is to buy a low end smart TV and run it in demo/store mode without connecting it to the internet. Whereupon, it it will act just like a dumb TV with the brightness and contrast jacked up to simulate the more expensive models. reply",

It's long since disappeared from the app stores, but my son recently asked if he could play it, which got me thinking about whether it might be recoverable.<p>I'm wondering if there's any way to find a copy of it somewhere on the web (I assume it was probably pirated at some point during its lifetime). And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps? I'd appreciate any suggestions on:<p>* Where to look for archived APKs or IPAs\n* How to sideload/run old mobile apps on modern devices\n* Whether emulators might be a viable option</p></p></p></div>",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

I've got years of random side projects and pretty much every photo I've taken going back many years. It's a complete mess, with various duplications, it's just not that big (few hundred GB maybe? I'm away from home so can't open up my NAS and look) so not worth my time to optimize it. On the flip side it's fun to randomly browse through and take a trip down memory lane. When there's a particular thing I definitely want can be more of a pain to find than if I had any decent organization but that comes up rarely enough that I don't really care. reply",

          "text": "Three things that have bitten me recently: 1. beware of encryption, especially Microsoft and Apple. I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

(it's in the 'Framework Desktop', for example, but not in their laptop lineup yet) AMD/Intel hasn't surpassed Apple yet (there's no answer for the M4 Max / M3 Ultra, without exploding the energy use on the AMD/Intel side), but AMD does at least have a comparable and competitive offering. reply",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon. Apple Silicon optimizes for idle states and x86 optimizes for throughput, which assumes very different use cases. One of the challenges for using x86 in laptops is that the microarchitectures are server-optimized at their heart. ARM in general does not have the top-end performance of x86 if you are doing any kind of performance engineering. I don't think that is controversial.

Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article.

The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

It also requires highly competent operating system developers focusing on the issue for a very long time, and being able to co-design the operating system, firmware and hardware together.

To be fair, usually the linux itself has hardware acceleration available but the browser vendors tend to disable gpu rendering except on controlled/known perfectly working combinations of OS/Hardware/Drivers and they have much less testing in Linux. In most case you can force enabling gpu rendering in about:config and try it out yourself and leave it unless you get recurring crashes. reply",

I assume this is referring to the tweet from the launch of the M1 showing off that retaining and releasing an NSObject is like 3x faster. That's more of a general case of the ARM ISA being a better fit for modern software than x86, not some specific optimization for Apple's software. x86 was designed long before desktops had multi-core processors and out-of-order execution, so for backwards compatibility reasons the architecture severely restricts how the processor is allowed to reorder memory operations. ARM was designed later, and requires software to explicitly request synchronization of memory operations where it's needed, which is much more performant and a closer match for the expectations of modern software, particularly post-C/C++11 (which have a weak memory model at the language level). Reference counting operations are simple atomic increments and decrements, and when your software uses these operations heavily (like Apple's does), it can benefit significantly from running on hardware with a weak memory model. reply",

          "text": "I honestly don't see myself ever leaving Macbooks at this point. It's the whole package: the battery life is insane, I've literally never had a dead laptop when I needed it no matter what I'm doing or where I'm at; it runs circles around every other computer I own, save for my beastly gaming PC; the stability and consistency of MacOS, and the underlying unix arch for a lot of tooling, all the way down to the build quality being damn near flawless save for the annoying lack of ports (though increasingly, I find myself needing ports less and less). Like, would I prefer an older-style Macbook overall, with an integrated card reader, HDMI port, ethernet jack, all that? Yeah, sure. But to get that now I have to go to a PC laptop and there's so many compromises there. The battery life isn't even in the same zip code as a Mac, they're much heavier, the chips run hot even just doing web browsing let alone any actual work, and they CREAK. Like my god I don't remember the last time I had a Windows laptop open and it wasn't making all manner of creaks and groans and squeaks. The last one would be solved I guess if you went for something super high end, or at least I hope it would be, but I dunno if I'm dropping $3k+ either way I'd just as soon stay with the Macbook. reply",

After three years, I upgraded to a MacBook Pro with M3 Pro, 36GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. I use this as my main machine with 2 displays attached via a TB4 dock. I'm working in IT and I get all new machines for our company over my desk to check them, and I observed the exact same points as the OP. The new machines are either fast and loud and hot and with poor battery life, or they are slow and \"warm\" and have moderate battery life. But I had no business laptop yet, ARM, AMD, or Intel, which can even compete with the M1 Air, not to speak of the M3 Pro! Not to speak about all the issues with crappy Lenovo docks, etc. It doesn’t matter if I install Linux or Windows. The funny point is that some of my colleagues have ordered a MacBook Air or Pro and use their Windows or Linux and a virtual machine via Parallels. Think about it: Windows 11 or Linux in a VM is even faster, snappier, more silent, and has even longer battery life than these systems native on a business machine from Lenovo, HP, or Dell. Well, your mileage may vary, but IMHO there is no alternative to a Mac nowadays, even if you want to use Linux or Windows. reply",

          "text": "There’s a number of reasons, all of which in concert create the appearance of a performance gap between the two: * Apple has had decades optimizing its software and hardware stacks to the demands of its majority users, whereas Intel and AMD have to optimize for a much broader scope of use cases. * Apple was willing to throw out legacy support on a regular basis. Intel and AMD, by comparison, are still expected to run code written for DOS or specific extensions in major Enterprises, which adds to complexity and cost * The “standard” of x86 (and demand for newly-bolted-on extensions) means effort into optimizations for efficiency or performance meet diminishing returns fairly quickly. The maturity of the platform also means the “easy” gains are long gone/already done, and so it’s a matter of edge cases and smaller tweaks rather than comprehensive redesigns. * Software in x86 world is not optimized, broadly, because it doesn’t have to be. The demoscene shows what can be achieved in tight performance envelopes, but software companies have never had reason to optimize code or performance when next year has always promised more cores or more GHz. It boils down to comparing two different products and asking why they can’t be the same. Apple’s hardware is purpose-built for its userbase, operating systems, and software; x86 is not, and never has been. Those of us who remember the 80s and 90s of SPARC/POWER/Itanium/etc recall that specialty designs often performed better than generalist ones in their specialties , but lacked compatibility as a result. The Apple ARM vs Intel/AMD x86 is the same thing. reply",

          "text": "Fair enough, but Apple Silicon is not a specialist chip in the way a SPARC chip was. It's a general purpose SoC & SiP stack. There is nothing stopping Intel being able to invest in SoC & SiP and being able to maintain backward compatibility while providing much better power/performance for a mobile (including laptop and tablet), product strategy. They could also just sit down with Microsoft and say \"Right, we're going to go in an entirely different direction, and provide you with something absolutely mind-blowing, but we're going to have to do software emulation for backward compatibility and that will suck for a while until things get recompiled, or it'll suck forever if they never do\". Apple did this twice in the last 20 years - once on the move from PowerPC chips to Intel, and again from Intel to Apple Silicon. If Microsoft and enough large OEMs (Dell, etc.), thought there was enough juice in the new proposed architecture to cause a major redevelopment of everything from mobile to data centre level compute, they'd line right up, because they know that if you can significantly reduce the amount of power consumption while smashing benchmarks, there are going to long, long wait times for that hardware and software, and its pay day for everyone. We now know so much more about processor design, instruction set and compiler design than we did when the x86 was shaping up, it seems obvious to me that: 1. RISC is a proven entity worth investing in 2. SoC & SiP is a proven entity worth investing in 3. Customers love better power/performance curves at every level from the device in their pocket to the racks in data centres 4. Intel is in real trouble if they are seriously considering the US government owning actual equity, albeit proposed as non-voting, non-controlling Intel can keep the x86 line around if they want, but their R&D needs to be chasing where the market is heading - and fast - while bringing the rest of the chain along with them. reply",

The 'emulation story' only needs to work for a couple of generations, then it itself can be sunsetted and is not expected to be backwards compatible with newer OSes. It is also the reason it is pretty much impossible to upgrade CPUs in Apple machines. > IMO, this is better then carrying around 40 years of cruft. Backwards compatibility is such a strong point, it is why windows survives even though it has become a bloated ad riddled mess. You can argue which is better, but that seriously depends on your requirements. If you have a business application coded 30 years ago on x86 that no developer in your company understands any more, then backwards compatibility is king.

This is something that few companies have the ability to do as they target a wide array of hardware. This is even more impressive given the scale of Apple's hardware. The same kernel runs on a Watch and a Mac Studio. Second, the x86 platform has a lot of legacy, and each operation on x86 is translated from an x86 instruction into RISC-like micro-ops. This is an inherent penalty that Apple doesn't have pay, and it is also why Rosetta 2 can achieve \"near native\" x86 performance; both platform translate the x86 instructions. Third, there are some architectural differences even if the instruction decoding steps are removed from the discussion. Apple Silicon has a huge out-of-order buffer, and it's 8-wide vs x86 4-wide. From there, the actual logic is different, the design is different, and the packaging is different. AMD's Ryzen AI Max 300 series does get close to Apple by using many of the same techniques like unified memory and tossing everything onto the package, where it does lose is due to all of the other differences. In the end, if people want crazy efficiency Apple is a great answer and delivers solid performance. If people want the absolute highest performance, then something like Ryzen Threadripper, EPYC, or even the higher-end consumer AMD chips are great choices. reply",

AFAIK, M4 is now 10-wide, and most x86 is 6-wide (Ryzen 5 does some weird stuff). X86 was 4-wide at the time of M1’s introduction. 4. M1 has over 600 reorder buffer registers… it’s significantly larger than competitors. 5. Close relative to x86 competitors. reply",

This is an inherent penalty that Apple doesn't have pay, and it is also why Rosetta 2 can achieve \"near native\" x86 performance; both platform translate the x86 instructions. Can we please stop with this myth? Every superscalar processor is doing the exact same thing, converting the ISA into the µops (which may involve fission or fusion) that are actually serviced by the execution units. It doesn't matter if the ISA is x86 or ARM or RISC-V--it's a feature of the superscalar architecture, not the ISA itself. The only reason that this canard keeps coming out is because the RISC advocates thought that superscalar was impossible to implement for a CISC architecture and x86 proved them wrong, and so instead they pretend that it's only because x86 somehow cheats and converts itself to RISC internally. reply",

I love how I can unplug my headphones from my work Mac, plug directly into the phone (no adapter required!) and it effectively mutes Slack without actually muting it. Syncing with the latest version of iTunes still works, albeit slowly. I also use an iPad 4 (tethered to iOS 6) as an ebook. iBooks works great and I love the pseudomorphic design.

          "text": "I recommend calm and caution :) You will quickly end up researching mechanical split keyboard market and start convincing yourself that 500-1000€ is not that expensive (sic!). I made an adventure into mechanicals, around half a year on research and getting used to it. Configurability is amazing. Quality great. Noise was not a problem. Ended up going back to some flat (laptop-like) dell keyboard and a vertical mouse instead. Because my hands started to stiffen up, hurt, the typical stuff. Keyboards were too high (with normal keys) and too expensive+weird (with low profile keys). I tried adding dedicated palm rests, changing habits a bit, changing bindings... In the end I'm considering buying MS' Sculpt ergonomic keyboard again (it's the one that's actually split, low profile, with optional negative tilt. I think it's only sold with a mouse). It has a lot of flaws, but fatigue was not one of them. What I'm trying to say: you may spend a lot of time, effort and money and still feel miserable. There are amazing builds out there, but don't forget non mechanical options exist. reply",

My take on it is that ergonomic keyboards that limit the amount of finger movement make your typing more repetitive - hence you need to be sure as hell that there is as little strain as possible. I also went with a minimal split keyboard and quickly started to feel pain. When I however looked at my desk/chair/screen, I found that they don't promote the correct posture. Once these were corrected, I got no pain at all. I think the right lesson is that this is a journey, rather than a problem you can throw some money at once and have it solved. reply",

Since this project is an AI resume builder, the accounts hosting the project can easily extract private data, such as phone numbers, emails, and addresses, and use it for malicious purposes, scams, etc. And that's what I'm more worried about. :(<p>I never intended to paywall this project. My goal was to provide a local first alternative to some online resume builders, and the accounts are doing the exact opposite, and they've hosted it at: https://gojob.ing/<p>I've tried commenting on the PR about the features they're working on, but I haven't received any replies so far.<p>What am I supposed to do here?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

          "text": "> This shows how immature the field of software engineering is. Imagine bridges or houses were built like that. You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

          "text": "For me, software design is more comparable to business system and organization design. It’s just that instead of humans executing the processes you design, it’s machines doing it. I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

If you put five engineers of any discipline in a room, you will get five different answers. Every contractor and architect has their own ideas about how things should be done. Furthermore, we do build houses this way, even in the modern age with building codes. The builder is going to do whatever they can get away with and this is a universal truth. The only reason bridges are held to such high standards is because of the monetary cost of a collapse. The \"norms\" are not what you think they are. They're tradition, they're \"we've always done it this way\". What you're talking about are laws written for public safety. Those laws only exist because we tried and failed to do things a certain way and the cost in money or lives was untenable. > \"I recognize a good solution when I see it\" is just not good enough for a serious engineering discipline. You're conflating engineering with science. A scientist will rigorously test and validate, but a huge part of engineering is just recognizing a good solution.

Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

You could imagine a rewrite into another programming language which would preserve the design but completely replace the implementation. You should practice writing design docs.  Don't worry about what the doc is supposed to look like, and definitely don't work off of a template.  The most important thing about the doc is that another human could do the implementation if you gave it to them. The doc can also function as a \"proof of consideration\". If you choose to do something one way, but there are other possible ways to do it, you can acknowledge the other possible ways, and say why they are worse.  By preemptively acknowledging an alternative, you have proved to readers that you considered it. All a \"good\" system designer is doing is considering a larger design space than most, and consistently finding good points in the space.  Pick a problem, sample points in the design space, tell me why some points are better than others, and write it all down. reply",

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

For example how do you determine which code bases are well designed if you yourself are not comfortable determining such? Instead, heed the guidance of some of the other comments and just start building things. Plan on failing and solving for the failure. That’s called practice. With enough practice you will know what works well for you. If you are measuring things along the way you will also know what’s slow. reply",

          "text": "I've done this for years and swear by it. Top 5 codebases for changing my mind about things: Wietse Venema's Postfix mail server. Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

          "text": "That would be quite clever for an incredibly horrible website. The other day my SO, who is a Turkish citizen, was filling up her visa application and after half an hour of meticulous form filling the system just kick her out. I think the session times out or something. If you haven't created an account or you haven't write down the current application ID everything is lost. In the process she was also directed to a non-.gov website for something during the process, I thought she was getting scammed but no. It actually makes sense to have a paid service that makes this abomination less painful. Though they work with VFS Global for collecting the applications and relevant documents, the VFS Global itself is an abomination and doesn't help with the handling of the form filling anyway. Recently EU streamlined the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens as those \"visa agencies\" that are the official agencies and the only way to apply for a visa for many countries don't actually help with anything and are scamming people by selling the \"good hours\" for the visa appointment on the black market. An agency was dropped for this and the scams by agencies were listed among the reasons to streamline the application process. Both with US and EU people are losing scholarships etc. due to outrageous wait times that are sometimes are years ahead or there's an issue with the systems handling the applications. I guess there must be an opportunity there to fix all this together with smaller stuff like handling transliteration and character encodings, I wonder if some of those scam site are not scams and actually help with it. An AI agent  can be useful here. reply",

I'll approximate the throttle by limiting chrome to 128kbps, 500ms delay, and 5% packet loss for fun. With a fresh incognito session, google responds to \"here to 4th street\" in 10 seconds, and when I click to open maps it needs just under two minutes to load.  Then I can click on the transit option and it needs another 10 seconds to update. Not too bad for a cold cache.  If I do it again with a hot cache it only takes 20 seconds to go through the whole process.  And I expect the app to be similar to the hot cache situation.  Even with 64kbps I'd expect reasonable results.  Do any cell providers throttle worse than that? I agree with your argument about bloat in general, but google in particular has a lot of good engineering resources and tries to work well on bad connections. Also I would be in favor of some spectrum licensing rules that say you can't throttle below 1Mbps... reply",

This is common.  Work begins on some web sites immediately after the election. For example, when a new president is sworn in, the White House web site flips immediately. More to the parent poster's point, it has been widely reported in the legitimate media repeatedly that many federal web sites have been replaced or significantly altered by the current administration.  There's an entire pseudo-department for it that also makes headlines for its greater transgressions. Add to that severe and sudden budget and staffing cuts, and like all government functions -- you get what you pay for. reply",

          "text": "Hi, about the Schengen visa situation in Turkey you can find articles like these that describe how the appointments are on the black market(In Turkish but I'm sure AI will do good job translating): https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5r2l43kn2o https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/22/vize-sorunu-kontrolden-cikt... On the social media the anecdotes differ but some say they were able to get the visa appointments bots, others say it was agency personel selling it to them under the table. Maybe its really the agency personel, or maybe it's people running bots to snap appointments and sell those pretending to be from the agency - can't know for sure but there are multiple services where people purchase appointments unofficially. In general the news situation in Turkey isn't very good as with the law enforcement but as you can see even BBC took notice. Generally speaking, these visa agencies are very unfriendly and unreachable. They seem to just collect the money, provide no personalized help at all. My GF had some questions about her US visa application, we were not able to reach VFS Global.  The phone numbers provided don't work, it's not even like taking long to speak with a human, the phone just gives you calling error. She previously used the same company for her Schengen visa for a company event in Paris, of course unreachable again and no appointments available. Because she works at a French corporation, she was able to ask a high ranking French person in the company who has a contact with the French embassy and they arranged the appointment shortly. reply",

Besides that, EU has \"green passport\" exception for the Turkish nationals, where they can travel visa-free on this kind of passport that is provided to individuals that meet certain criteria and millions of such passports were issued. The rejection rates are also not bad and EU has a \"return agreement\" with Turkey, which is designed to keep the middle eastern refugees in Turkey(essentially, if you come from Turkey EU can send you back to Turkey right away ).

But you were also chastised for saying “you guys” -\n even though the women said as much as the men, if you didn’t put the proper pronouns under your profile.  I got chastised for saying “war room”.  I heard an anecdote that now “pow wow” wasn’t allowed. One podcast I listen to - Stuff You Should Know - replayed an old episode and added a disclaimer up front apologizing  because the episode was about pregnancy complications and in the older episode they were being “heteronormative” by not calling out that this issue only affects cisgendered women. I’m not saying anyone should be disrespected or I wouldn’t call someone by whatever name or pronoun they prefer. I also found all of the “ally” groups, discussion of “micro aggressions” etc groan worthy. This is in the DNCs charter https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-gender-non... > The language now says committees “shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1).”\nGender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, “and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided.” Yes I would find this just as bad if the language was about race and someone of mixed race heritage. I would much rather hang out with good live and let live traditional “guns and church family centered” old school Hank Hill conservatives (even though I’m not one), than the posturing “anti-racist” leftist wing. reply",

Nobody felt “silenced” by avoiding harmful words.\nThen came the hyperboles and the rigid rules you describe. To me, these are very similar to the poor-quality AI filters I discuss in my article: they judge without context. But judging requires more than scanning words—it requires understanding how, why, when, and under what circumstances something is said.\nWhat you’ve experienced—and thank you for sharing—is the result of bad, simplistic policy created by people who haven’t truly tried to understand or adapt. Human beings, societies, even nature itself, are complex systems. They can’t be reduced to mechanical yes/no rules.\nThat’s the heart of my article. And what I truly believe—as an eternal optimist—is that we can get to a place of smarter filters and smarter ways to coexist. It will take time, patience, and sincere effort.

Of course, it did reach a point of hyperbole—where even historic artworks were misread as offensive or racist. As the Greeks said: “Μέτρον ἄριστον”—balance is best. We don’t need to provoke just to indulge our worst instincts, but we also need tolerance for expressions that aren’t perfectly curated. That said, my article isn’t really about political correctness. It’s about low-quality AI filters that can’t read context, and the corporate shortcuts that rely on them. My point isn’t to rant or complain, but to suggest a new era of content moderation—one that’s smarter, fairer, and more democratic. reply",

The thing that is driving me crazy in this world though is the 'tab tab tab' view that these approaches have. It is hard enough when predictive text tries to finish the word I am typing much less a whole sentence or code block. It is very hard to think freely when something is whispering in your ear what you should say next. I am very hesitant to look at VSCode. I have strong push back against Microsoft related tools (related, best alternative to GitHub?) That is mostly on principle now though. I have avoided them so long that I can't honestly comment on their quality anymore. Everything Microsoft though long term seem so to...degrade. It does it in a way that when you finally realize you hate the tool you also realize you should have jumped 2 years ago. They are so good at finding the line where it is just good enough and just barely keeping you there, but not clearly above it. Thanks for the suggestions! reply",

I know when people are lying, I know when something is off, but I cannot really pinpoint what it is.<p>And by the way, if you are hinting at autism and whatever, this is not helpful. Not for me, not for you, not for anybody.<p>The question is if you can relate. And what you did yourself, if you can or could relate, to get out of this. And only speak from experience, I don't want some \"ten rules on how to do whatever\" by some guru, but I want your real experience, how you handled this, how you got out of it, and how you started trusting your own opinion more, or how you found truth outside that made you so secure in a solution for problem or gave you a lot of answers at once like an avalanche.<p>Just in general, what is your source for answers?<p>PS: Currently AI fills this void for me.

I’d first note down what I already know or would try. Then compare outside input to that. It built trust in my own reasoning. Now I treat all advice (AI included) as raw input, not truth.

The only issue with this plan is that as far as I can tell there's no easy way to only install the Audio Bookshelf app, and remove all other apps. While if the device does not have internet access I'm not concerned about them poking around in the email, calendar, etc it'd be nice if there were fewer distractions.

          "text": "I wonder where the prior-generation servers end up once well-funded companies upgrade E-waste recyclers because they can handle bulk. Suppose 500 servers get replaced. To a first approximation, nobody who needs 500 servers is interested in 500 old servers and if they were they already bought 500 servers or are waiting for a better deal or aren’t ready to move out their 500 servers to make room. Recyclers have the real estate to receive 500 servers and experience disposing 500 servers. And there are not 500 hobbyists lined up…and who wants to deal with misinformed consumers? There are all sorts of incompatibility nuances with complex computer hardware. ——- Advice: If your hobby is gonna be training models, just build a box. If you want a server rack hobby, then buy a server rack and be ready to pay the dumb tax. reply",

From this pov, AI is the best thing that has happened to my weekend coding. I code recreationally way more than before. Before AI, I would try a new language or framework, and I’d give up halfway because re-figuring out basic stuff for the umpteenth time is boring, it’s not fun at all. Now AI lets me skip those boring parts. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>My daily workhorse is a M1 Pro that I purchased on release date, It has been one of the best tech purchases I have made, even now it really deals with anything I throw at it. My daily work load is regularly having a Android emulator, iOS simulator and a number of Dockers containers running simultaneously and I never hear the fans, battery life has taken a bit of a hit but it is still very respectable.<p>I wanted a new personal laptop, and I was debating between a MacBook Air or going for a Framework 13 with Linux. I wanted to lean into learning something new so went with the Framework and I must admit I am regretting it a bit.<p>The M1 was released back in 2020 and I bought the Ryzen AI 340 which is one of the newest 2025 chips from AMD, so AMD has 5 years of extra development and I had expected them to get close to the M1 in terms of battery efficiency and thermals.<p>The Ryzen is using a TSMC N4P process compared to the older N5 process, I managed to find a TSMC press release showing the performance/efficiency gains from the newer process: “When compared to N5, N4P offers users a reported +11% performance boost or a 22% reduction in power consumption. Beyond that, N4P can offer users a 6% increase in transistor density over N5”<p>I am sorely disappointed, using the Framework feels like using an older Intel based Mac. If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.<p>Why haven’t AMD/Intel been able to catch up? Is x86 just not able to keep up with the ARM architecture? When can we expect a x86 laptop chip to match the M1 in efficiency/thermals?!<p>To be fair I haven’t tried Windows on the Framework yet it might be my Linux setup being inefficient.<p>Cheers,\nStephen</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life. If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming. Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU . 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours. Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power. All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing. > If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up. It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube. reply",

MeeGo proceeded far too slowly and Elop chose his former employers' Windows instead in 2011. Nokia's decline only increased and Intel hired many Nokia engineers. Soon Nokia made no phone anymore and Intel did not even manage to make their first mass-selling product. ARM-based SoCs were 10 years ahead in power saving. The ARM ecosystem did not make any fatal mistakes, Intel never caught up. reply",

And the atoms were buggy as hell, never had more problems with dumb cache/fabric/memory controller issues. To me the Atom team always felt like a dead-end inside intel - everyone seemed to be trying to get in to a different higher-status team ASAP - our engineering contacts often changed monthly, if we even knew who our \"contacts\" were meant to be at any time.

That makes its CPU cores a fair bit less efficient that AMDs even on the same production node. If Apple Silicon didn't exist then you might instead argue that x86-64 is more efficient than ARM. If all that's true then why does Snapdragon have better battery life? As I said in my comment the great battery life comes from when the CPU isn't being used. It's everything else around it. That's where AMD is still significantly behind. reply",

Perfect example is trying to get to the bottom of why your windows laptop won't go to sleep and cooks itself in your backpack So, I was thinking like this as well, and after I lost my Carbon X1 I felt adventurous, but not too adventurous, and wanted a laptop that \"could just work\". The thinking was \"If Microsoft makes both the hardware and the software, it has to work perfectly fine, right?\", so I bit my lip and got a Surface Pro 8. What a horrible laptop that was, even while I was trialing just running Windows on it. Overheated almost immediately by itself, just idling, and STILL suffers from the issue where the laptop sometimes wake itself while in my backpack, so when I actually needed it, of course it was hot and without battery. I've owned a lot of shit laptops through the years, even some without keys in the keyboard, back when I was dirt-poor, but the Surface Pro 8 is the worst of them all, I regret buying it a lot. I guess my point is that just because Apple seem really good at the whole \"vertically integrated\" concept, it isn't magic by itself, and Microsoft continues to fuck up the very same thing, even though they control the entire stack, so you'll still end up with backpack laptops turning themselves on/not turning off properly. I'd wager you could let Microsoft own every piece of physical material in the world, and they'd still not be able to make a decent laptop. reply",

For Blender numbers, M4 Pro numbers came from Max Tech's review.[0] I don't remember where I got the Strix Halo numbers from. Could have been from another Youtube video or some old Notebookcheck article. Anyway, Blender has official GPU benchmark numbers now: M4 Pro: 2497 [1] Strix Halo: 1304 [2] So M4 Pro is roughly 90% faster in the latest Blender. The most likely reason for why Blender's official numbers favors  M4 Pro even more is because of more recent optimizations.

How is you bringing up synthetics relevant to race to idle? Regardless, a number of things can be done on Strix Halo to improve the performance, first would be switching to some optimized Linux distro, or at least the kernel. That would claw back 5-20% depending on the task. It would also improve single core efficiency, I've seen my 7945hx drop from 14-15w idle on Windows to about 7-8 on Linux, because Windows likes to jerk off the CCDs non stop and throw the tasks around willy nilly which causes the second CCD and I/O die to never properly idle. reply",

For high-throughput server software x86 is significantly more efficient than Apple Silicon.

A lot of the problems here can't actually be fixed by intel, amd, or anyone designing x86 laptops because getting that level of efficiency requires the ability to strongly lead the app developer community. It also requires highly competent operating system developers focusing on the issue for a very long time, and being able to co-design the operating system, firmware and hardware together. Microsoft barely cares about Windows anymore, the Linux guys only care about servers since forever, and that leaves Apple alone in the market. I doubt anything will change anytime soon. reply",

And if I could find it, what would be the best approach to get it running again?<p>Has anyone here successfully recovered and revived their old mobile apps?

I'm away from home so can't open up my NAS and look) so not worth my time to optimize it. On the flip side it's fun to randomly browse through and take a trip down memory lane.

          "text": "+1. My basic structure is a big share/ directory that is mounted on all my machines (over sshfs + tailscale if need be). There's some basic top-level organization (Projects, Financial Documents, Photos) but other than that, the key thing for me was a Projects/Active/, Projects/Ice/, Projects/Done folder that I move things between. If I don't know where to file a thing, I just make a new folder under Projects/Active/, keep an eye on your workflow, and reorganize if you see an issue. Stick to the process, not the plan[1]. The absolute worst approach I tried was to curate things. Nothing got filed. Embracing the chaos allowed the pattern to evolve around my revealed workflows, and now after a couple years I pretty much know where to instantly find or file things.

I've encrypted Apple disk images with lost passwords, and USB drives that I'm not sure I'll ever decrypt now that I've mostly moved to Linux 2. USB drives rot. I have at least one sitting on my desk that doesn't work, or doesn't work with Linux, or is encrypted, I can't tell but I think it's dead and I've no idea what's on it 3. assume anything other than text or open formats will be useless later. I've a ton of info archived in closed proprietary formats that I might never be able to access. Duplication is inevitable. I've a box of CD/DVD archives, a dozen large USB drives, two NAS, and half a dozen computers, and with all that storage and space I can't even have a definitive music collection. It's on both NAS, multiple computers, an MP3 player, my phone, and all the copies are different. We've 14 terabytes of photos, and so I now need to buy another NAS to replace the two I have and keep the old ones as a backup. It's endless curation, both for hardware and data. And yet, the code I've lost. The photos that didn't make it to backup. I have those regrets too, like they were truly valuable. Final thoughts: cloud storage isn't storage, it's short term for shuffling data between devices. Even email isn't secure - Yahoo deleted all my messages without warning because I didn't log in for a year. reply",

Luckily I’ve been able to find an emulator called Cloudpilot Emu to run some of my old PalmOS games in the browser. I think if I was doing a game now and wanted to be able to look back on it in 10 to 20 years time I’d be doing it in C with SDL or JavaScript - although you’re betting on those being around.

His family has spent years and $millions getting him to the point of looking & sounding pretty good, within that very limited social context.  But he's never actually made a PB&J sandwich.  Let alone gotten dressed and gone to the grocery store by himself. Over cocktails, Mr. ChatGPT seems darned impressive.

          "text": "A couple of things I'll point out. Evolution occurs at the level of population genetics, and it's not concerned with finding a stable state for any characteristic, at least not directly. But more importantly to your question, the way we define society right now, or agree to be governed, is not a given, and it's not a fundamental quality of the universe or its reality. Society in this point in time is an artifact of this point in time, and the accumulation of our historical and cultural works. So what is the societal problem, and for whom? How is the meaning of such a problem transferred from a social phenomena (resource allocation) to a biological one (stress responses, like cortisol homeostasis) to one which affects populations (propagation of some phenotype or genes)? You have to connect sentience and cognition in a direct line with biological stress responses and evolutionary genetics, and its effect on brain evolution. It's an interesting question, but it depends on how it is decomposed and framed. reply",

          "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not a researcher in this topic and I have no idea what I'm talking about, just putting my thoughts here I think that depends on how you define stress? The brain is all electrical signals, so from this simplistic point of view there shouldn't be such thing as \"stress\", but from my understanding the connections, even though electrical, produce chemical by-products which have to be \"flushed away\" by the gray matter. This and just human experience suggests brain can get \"tired\". However, I don't think the societal problems throughout history had much relevance to the individual stress brains my experience, but more caused by cognitive dissonance when you try to put two conscious beings together, as every brain is different so produces different outputs to same input. Additionally, we still are very much driven by our animal instincts, even though we like to pretend we've \"ascended\" and have free will. Now the question is, where can we evolve from here? What evolutionary pressure is there to evolve? We've pretty much peaked as lifeforms, we can dominate any and every environment we want to the point of being detrimental to the Earth itself. Also this highly scientific documentary I re-watched recently called \"Idiocracy (2006)\" suggests that higher brain function doesn't necessarily increase the chance of passing genes along, and I tend to agree. reply",

But this is preventing me from using some services and products (Vercel, DocuSign, etc.)<p>I’m curious about the reasons behind this. Is it primarily technical (spam prevention, deliverability issues), business-driven (carriers pushing back on VoIP), or just an easy way to block disposable accounts? Is something more dystopian going on, like some kind of behind-the-scenes lookup of my \"true\" info if I provide my cell?<p>Also, if anyone has insight into how companies technically detect and filter VoIP numbers at scale, I’d love to understand that side too. E.g. what lookup info via Twilio causes a number to get rejected?  I assume it is the 'type' from Twilio Line Type Intelligence (or equivalent)?<p>https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api/line-type-intelligence</p></p></p></p></div>",

Do I believe other intelligent life forms visit earth in their flying saucers, abduct people, anal probe them, abduct and slaughter cows, build pyramids, and - apparently - crash often? No, not really. I mean, I can't rule it out, but my personal subjective Bayesian prior towards this notion would probably be something like 0.001 or so. But that's actually up from years past, as we learn more about more possibly inhabitable planets that are closer to Earth than was previously known, etc. reply",

In the past in various projects this approach proved problematic because \"environment parity\" with the target runtime (browser) couldn't be achieved (e.g. no WebRTC[1]). In those projects we resolved this problem by writing our own test runner that could be injected into a headless browser process.<p>So now the same sort of problem has arisen with a mobile device project using react native: I assumed that unit tests would be runnable on a device or at least an emulator, but it seems not (see: https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/). Or at least so far I haven't found the secret sauce or tool to allow that. Any pointers welcome.<p>[1]Yes there is a WebRTC port for Node that uses an old version of Google's C++ library, but it doesn't actually work properly.</p></p></div>",

I'm a senior web developer and help maintain hundreds of PHP repositories for work. I avoid the use of AI as best I can. When I do ask questions to an LLM, I feel that I'm partaking in a dirty habit that I should quit. I don't have anything for that installed on my machine/integrated in my IDE. I feel that using LLMs to understand and solve problems is unreliable, a barrier for my personal development, a threat to the future of the industry I work in, unfair to those who wrote the content it is trained on, and bad for the environment.

          "text": "The term \"design\" is ambiguous here. When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better.

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

A team of juniors will butcher your intricate design and Conway’s Law makes your software reflect the team. reply",

The most important thing about the doc is that another human could do the implementation if you gave it to them. The doc can also function as a \"proof of consideration\". If you choose to do something one way, but there are other possible ways to do it, you can acknowledge the other possible ways, and say why they are worse.

It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match .

Good design is so deeply tied to the domain details. Wonham's Internal Model Principle applies to code. Example: I wanted to solve the problem of unit testing for embedded targets. I found open source projects that do this and read the code critically to see how and why it is written. As I build my own approach, I revisit theirs to learn more as my understanding of the domain deepens. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">By \"archetypically savvy\", I mean websites and other online communities that are both somewhat niche and known for specific mannerisms. I'd say that the key mannerism that distinguishes these online communities from the rest is when someone posts a link to another unfamiliar site and other users of the community respond almost reflexively that it is an \"ip logger\" or an \"ip grabber\", since they have assimilated into the online community's culture.<p>I've also found that these sites have a tendency to revolve around their Discord channels more than the actual website, oftentimes creating a secretive culture that lacks transparency. The participants of the Discord usually come there to spill the tea about users who've been caught up in a scandal. At best, it's usually something like a user \"scraping the site\" or \"botting the site\", and at worst, the userbase finding out that a prominent user has engaged in online grooming and what have you. More often than not, it's a member of the \"staff team\" that gets caught red handed.<p>Lastly, I would also like to mention that online communities that exhibit the hallmarks outlined above seem disproportionately prone to either having server emulators and \"private servers\" created to replicate the functionality of the online community's website or game, or having parts of their codebase leaked outright. Whichever of those two happens, there's always a culture about users having access to the original site or game source code being the gatekeepers of secret knowledge.<p>I'm aware that these online communities can be very sketchy, and I don't mean to condone these specific online communities that have these traits. I just want to get everyone's input on the extent that they have encountered online communities that match my description, without explicitly naming the sites or games in question. I just wonder if this archetype is actually more common than I previously thought.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I'm building Concert Map [1], an interactive map of live music events all over the world. I was frustrated with how difficult it was to find concerts and festivals when travel plans are flexible. Questions like: - Is there any show I could catch on my next cross country road trip? - I want an excuse to visit Seattle this summer, is there a good weekend I could pick where I could see live music there or along the way? - I like to travel for one big music festival per year, is there a good match for me anywhere in the country, or abroad? The idea behind concert map is to show all events on a map, and highlight the \"most relevant\" events for any area, so you can skim through the map and find events that are worth the travel. The \"relevant\" events depend on the view context. If you import your top artists, then the most relevant events are ones with artists that you listen to most. Otherwise, it's based on global artist popularity. I'm currently working on integrating with more event providers, and working on loading performance. I've been using leaflet.js [2] which has worked great, but I'm experimenting with switching to supercluster [3].
