Just about the only thing I get from reading other people's code is the most egregious ways to not do something. This is a pretty common thing, a plurality of humans learn this way. We just have different standards for software, for some reason. We like to pretend books teach you something more \"real\" than just getting your hands dirty and writing some real fucked up code.

          "text": "The term \"design\" is ambiguous here. When design is a process to build something pleasing (like in music or painting), then yes, it's an art, and you can rightfully have different opinions about outcomes, sometimes diametrically opposed opinions, which is all not just fine and accepted but inherent in the field and a required ingredient. When design is about building something functional, then it's part of engineering. You can objectively measure whether it does satisfy the requirements. That's where serious engineering disciplines are and where software engineering needs to aim for if it wants to keep engineering in its title without getting laughed at. As long as programmers consider themselves part artists, that's hard to achieve, but as the field matures, there is hope. Note that some fields are trying to be both. For example architecture. There it's solved by making a more or less clear distinction between the pleasing art part (that's what the architect does) and the functional engineering part (structural engineer). Both roles are not being conflated. In software, we still do that. reply",

You're forgetting a key difference between software and the physical world. The blessing and curse of software is that there are few constraints on the solution so it can take an enormous number of different forms and still be valid.  There isn't gravity, friction or the various other things that constrain physical solutions. And each of those almost limitless solutions has different trade-offs related to a large number of different variables. It takes many many years of seeing the different impacts of those design decisions across the different variables within the constraints of different domains and contexts. It's truly a combinatorial problem with so many dimensions that no human is smart enough to just simulate the impact of design decisions in new and unfamiliar domains+context. You could argue that there could be standard ways of doing things within specific domains+context, but the context is so varied between companies, and business priorities have so many differences that I don't think it's a solvable problem. The best we can do is have higher level patterns and approaches to specific types of problems that can guide people based on others experiences, but all of that still needs to be mixed and matched for the specific problem space. reply",

I don’t think business system and organization design is approached like bridge design either, is it? Also, bridges, houses and surgeons can physically kill people if something goes wrong. Software that can physically kill people, such as that in airplanes or missiles, is actually treated quite differently from most software, I think? I don’t have experience in those industries those so I can’t comment on the specifics of how is it different, but my impression is that things are a lot more rigid. Business organization design also can’t directly kill people. In general, I think that there is a fundamental tension between looseness and flexibility of operations and innovation. If you are super rigorous and have set in stone best practices, it is going to be harder to find new ways of doing things that work better. I’m not really bothered if people don’t consider software to be a serious engineering discipline. I’m not sure I do either. If someone wants that kind of thing, I’d recommend they go into a different engineering discipline, rather than trying to make software like that. reply",

          "text": "My immediate reaction to this question is: \"your team's\". Nothing will teach you more about how to design software then really understanding why good and bad solutions were adapted to solve a certain real problem. Software exists precisely because there is still a messy layer connecting user requirements to actions on a computer. If there was not messiness then we could just automate it all. Approaching software from some sort of Platonic ideal of what software should be will frequently lead to bad decisions on it's own. When you start to see how certain pressures lead to certain paths you learn to recognize the wrong decisions that are often good at the time, and avoid them. At the same time, you need to learn to develop methods that work quickly and effectively. By far the biggest real challenge in real world software is time constraints . This is almost never discussed in theoretical views of software, but the truth is you're always going to be writing code under pressure to ship. You will come across situations where you do not have time to do what you want to do or think is best. Good software is software that runs and solves the user need, but you will come to realize that there are design solutions that will make successfully running happen more often. The best way to find these is to study the real software you're writing. reply",

          "text": "I think there is value in groking entire code bases. It's not just about whether or not they are well designed though. It is an important skill to be able to analyze and see the big picture of how things work together in large systems. For me it often involves drawing diagrams (sometimes UML) to map things out. Being able to view systems in this way is a pre-requisite to intentionally designing your own systems at this level. And yes, once you can work at this level you can learn from good designs, but also see problems with bad ones. EDIT: and to answer your question, if you're working on something that is \"like X but different\" then read the source code for X. You could also look at source code for software that you use from day to day: software where you already know what it does. For example, if you're in web, maybe the web framework, or web server, if you write python, maybe a core library that you use, or maybe the python interpreter, or if you use vscode ..., if you use android ..., you get the idea. At the start I would suggest smaller programs, and programs where you already know the domain (e.g. cpython might not be the best place to start if you never implemented an interpreter before, you may spend more time learning about interpreters than the design of this one, still a good thing to learn of course.) reply",

          "text": "This has 2 key things: * \"well designed\": What was the objectives and ideas... * \"codebases\": How well that was implemented They are a lot of lofty claims saying how this or that is \"fast, secure, etc\" but don't end like that in the actual implementation. But most of the time, that could be seen in the \"design claims\" already! Good design is not just full of adjectives and nice sounding goals, but the concrete considerations, what was the trade-offs, false-starts, and reasons behind the decisions. You can see some examples reading about the design of Erlang, early pascal, most RDBMS, etc. So, you first mid/long term goal is to learn to distinguish what good design actual look like. then, in relation with codebases then to be kinda easier: It actually follow the design? A good example is the 'std' library of Rust. It has a lot of lofty claims about security and such things that could sound alarms, but then you dive in the code of it and see is there A LOT of care about it, and a lot of docs comments discussing this stuff and then the code match . P.D: The \"std\" or equivalent of the lang is one of the most important codebases you need to learn and study, and the MAJOR way to judge how truly good is it. reply",

          "text": "While studying well-designed codebases is incredibly valuable, there's an important \"tip of the iceberg\" effect to consider: much of good software design lives in the \"negative space\" - what's deliberately not there. The decisions to exclude complexity, avoid premature abstractions, or reject certain patterns are often just as valuable as the code you can see. But when you're studying a codebase, you're essentially seeing the final edit without the editor's notes - all the architectural reasoning that shaped those choices is invisible. This is why I've started maintaining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my projects. These document the \"why\" behind significant technical choices, including the alternatives we considered and rejected. They're like technical blog posts explaining the complex decisions that led to the clean, simple code you see. ADRs serve as pointers not just for future human maintainers, but also for AI tools when you're using them to help with coding. They provide readable context about architectural constraints and compromises - \"we've agreed not to do X because of Y, so please adhere to Z instead.\" This makes AI assistance much more effective at respecting your design decisions rather than suggesting patterns you've deliberately avoided. When studying codebases for design patterns, I'd recommend looking for projects that also maintain ADRs, design docs, or similar decision artifacts. The combination of clean code plus the architectural reasoning behind it - especially the restraint decisions - provides a much richer learning experience. Some projects with good documentation of their design decisions include Rust's RFCs, Python's PEPs, or any project following the ADR pattern. Often the reasoning about what not to build is more instructive than the implementation itself. reply",

Taught me tons about security posture, the architecture i'd describe as microservices before microservices was a thing, but contrary to the modern take on microservices (it's mostly a tool for decomposing work across large semi-isolated groups) this was primarily about security and simplicity. Spring framework - this opened my eyes to ways of working that i hadn't really thought enough about before, the developers on that project have a culture of deeply considering the needs of their users (who are java developers often in an enterprise environment). Git - the thing i like about the git code base is that once you've covered the objects database (e.g. blobs, trees and commits) and the implementation of refs, everything else just feels like additional incremental features. With those core concepts, everything else is kinda harmoniously built on top. Varnish by Poul Henning-Kamp is another one - feels like he went to great lengths to make that code base a teaching tool despite the fact it's also a top tier reverse proxy. Last one isn't a code base - but it will help with software design in the large; studying how the lieutenants model works in the linux kernel. Thinking about my answers, i think i've highlighted something subtly different than \"well designed codebases\" it's more a list of codebases that left a notable long lasting impression on me because of design decisions they made. reply",

          "text": "That would be quite clever for an incredibly horrible website. The other day my SO, who is a Turkish citizen, was filling up her visa application and after half an hour of meticulous form filling the system just kick her out. I think the session times out or something. If you haven't created an account or you haven't write down the current application ID everything is lost. In the process she was also directed to a non-.gov website for something during the process, I thought she was getting scammed but no. It actually makes sense to have a paid service that makes this abomination less painful. Though they work with VFS Global for collecting the applications and relevant documents, the VFS Global itself is an abomination and doesn't help with the handling of the form filling anyway. Recently EU streamlined the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens as those \"visa agencies\" that are the official agencies and the only way to apply for a visa for many countries don't actually help with anything and are scamming people by selling the \"good hours\" for the visa appointment on the black market. An agency was dropped for this and the scams by agencies were listed among the reasons to streamline the application process. Both with US and EU people are losing scholarships etc. due to outrageous wait times that are sometimes are years ahead or there's an issue with the systems handling the applications. I guess there must be an opportunity there to fix all this together with smaller stuff like handling transliteration and character encodings, I wonder if some of those scam site are not scams and actually help with it. An AI agent  can be useful here. reply",

I'll approximate the throttle by limiting chrome to 128kbps, 500ms delay, and 5% packet loss for fun. With a fresh incognito session, google responds to \"here to 4th street\" in 10 seconds, and when I click to open maps it needs just under two minutes to load.  Then I can click on the transit option and it needs another 10 seconds to update. Not too bad for a cold cache.  If I do it again with a hot cache it only takes 20 seconds to go through the whole process.  And I expect the app to be similar to the hot cache situation.  Even with 64kbps I'd expect reasonable results.  Do any cell providers throttle worse than that? I agree with your argument about bloat in general, but google in particular has a lot of good engineering resources and tries to work well on bad connections. Also I would be in favor of some spectrum licensing rules that say you can't throttle below 1Mbps... reply",

This is common.  Work begins on some web sites immediately after the election. For example, when a new president is sworn in, the White House web site flips immediately. More to the parent poster's point, it has been widely reported in the legitimate media repeatedly that many federal web sites have been replaced or significantly altered by the current administration.  There's an entire pseudo-department for it that also makes headlines for its greater transgressions. Add to that severe and sudden budget and staffing cuts, and like all government functions -- you get what you pay for. reply",

          "text": "Hi, about the Schengen visa situation in Turkey you can find articles like these that describe how the appointments are on the black market(In Turkish but I'm sure AI will do good job translating): https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5r2l43kn2o https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/22/vize-sorunu-kontrolden-cikt... On the social media the anecdotes differ but some say they were able to get the visa appointments bots, others say it was agency personel selling it to them under the table. Maybe its really the agency personel, or maybe it's people running bots to snap appointments and sell those pretending to be from the agency - can't know for sure but there are multiple services where people purchase appointments unofficially. In general the news situation in Turkey isn't very good as with the law enforcement but as you can see even BBC took notice. Generally speaking, these visa agencies are very unfriendly and unreachable. They seem to just collect the money, provide no personalized help at all. My GF had some questions about her US visa application, we were not able to reach VFS Global.  The phone numbers provided don't work, it's not even like taking long to speak with a human, the phone just gives you calling error. She previously used the same company for her Schengen visa for a company event in Paris, of course unreachable again and no appointments available. Because she works at a French corporation, she was able to ask a high ranking French person in the company who has a contact with the French embassy and they arranged the appointment shortly. reply",

Besides that, EU has \"green passport\" exception for the Turkish nationals, where they can travel visa-free on this kind of passport that is provided to individuals that meet certain criteria and millions of such passports were issued. The rejection rates are also not bad and EU has a \"return agreement\" with Turkey, which is designed to keep the middle eastern refugees in Turkey(essentially, if you come from Turkey EU can send you back to Turkey right away ).

To a first approximation, nobody who needs 500 servers is interested in 500 old servers and if they were they already bought 500 servers or are waiting for a better deal or aren’t ready to move out their 500 servers to make room. Recyclers have the real estate to receive 500 servers and experience disposing 500 servers. And there are not 500 hobbyists lined up…and who wants to deal with misinformed consumers? There are all sorts of incompatibility nuances with complex computer hardware. ——- Advice: If your hobby is gonna be training models, just build a box.

We don’t need to provoke just to indulge our worst instincts, but we also need tolerance for expressions that aren’t perfectly curated. That said, my article isn’t really about political correctness.

But you were also chastised for saying “you guys” -\n even though the women said as much as the men, if you didn’t put the proper pronouns under your profile.  I got chastised for saying “war room”.  I heard an anecdote that now “pow wow” wasn’t allowed. One podcast I listen to - Stuff You Should Know - replayed an old episode and added a disclaimer up front apologizing  because the episode was about pregnancy complications and in the older episode they were being “heteronormative” by not calling out that this issue only affects cisgendered women. I’m not saying anyone should be disrespected or I wouldn’t call someone by whatever name or pronoun they prefer. I also found all of the “ally” groups, discussion of “micro aggressions” etc groan worthy. This is in the DNCs charter https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-gender-non... > The language now says committees “shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1).”\nGender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, “and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided.” Yes I would find this just as bad if the language was about race and someone of mixed race heritage. I would much rather hang out with good live and let live traditional “guns and church family centered” old school Hank Hill conservatives (even though I’m not one), than the posturing “anti-racist” leftist wing. reply",

Nobody felt “silenced” by avoiding harmful words.\nThen came the hyperboles and the rigid rules you describe. To me, these are very similar to the poor-quality AI filters I discuss in my article: they judge without context. But judging requires more than scanning words—it requires understanding how, why, when, and under what circumstances something is said.\nWhat you’ve experienced—and thank you for sharing—is the result of bad, simplistic policy created by people who haven’t truly tried to understand or adapt. Human beings, societies, even nature itself, are complex systems. They can’t be reduced to mechanical yes/no rules.\nThat’s the heart of my article. And what I truly believe—as an eternal optimist—is that we can get to a place of smarter filters and smarter ways to coexist. It will take time, patience, and sincere effort.

When I need to find something, I do the same. I only use Google with queries for \"site:reddit.com\" or \"site:news.ycombinator.com\" to get opinions of real people on a particular manner. Now, before you jump on me saying that AI is wrong, this is true. But at the same time, I no longer can be 100% sure that whatever SEO optimized website I land at provides accurate information. If I need solid facts, I usually double check AI with various other sources. For queries like \"best keyboard for software engineers\", I'd rather get a table with pros/cons from AI rather than landing on whatever affiliate related website is promoted on Google. LLM gives me a good starting point to either dig deeper into particular products, or query further to find more suggestions. Same for coding. I used to Google \"how to split a string in ruby\" and land on flame war, or 19 years old, StackOverflow question. Now I can get an updated answer from whatever LLM you prefer with a reference to the official documentation. It works for simple queries, as well as code snippets. Lastly, I use LLMs to plan trips or gift ideas. I'd just throw in my preferences, and let LLM build a rough plan, from which I can iterate further, or start doing my own research. reply",

Letting the LLM handle the boilerplate and framework jargon lets me focus on the business logic and the design patterns, and helps me contribute much faster. But LLMs do often make mistakes so it's not like I blindly trust the output. They don't replace your colleagues in terms of being the ultimate source of truth.

For example, using tailwind, I can just describe in english what I want to happen with page elements and for the most part AI gets the code right, sometimes its wrong and I need to debug. A common argument I hear about AI is \"I could just write it faster myself\", well I know CompSci and general info about a lot of software things but it would take hours of getting up to speed on areas I'm not an expert in to be productive. I can just delegate that to AI and get mostly correct outputs, this is okay with me and faster than what I could do. I think the cost is going to catch up with the AI companies running the models (not the companies building products that call AI APIs) and that is when the bubble will burst. They will need to keep increasing costs and at some threshold, fewer and fewer developers in an organization will have licenses because it may become unaffordable. reply",

It’s best when the deal is a known quantity vs looking over “who’s hiring monthly HN posts”. I had 10-15 people i was working with (not all employed) at my last startup and they all came through my network either directly (ex colleagues) or through trusted parties. Again it’s mostly a trust thing more than anything. I think a good strategy is to get close to the kind of startups you care about without (before) direct intent to join. It’s easy to hang out (or at least it used to be) through various events, meetups or co-working places. Many startups I didn’t join and could have been good, I’ve met through open-source (Hadoop, HBase, Mesos, etc.) these are companies like Cloudera, DataBricks etc. when they were tiny. I still miss that crowd, years later. So it’s mostly a matter of being close to what’s happening, able to filter and ready to jump when opportunity arises. reply",

          "text": "1. Twitter: Founders and employees of early stage startups are often on twitter. 2. Portfolios of great angel investors and VC firms. 3. Emailing people you admire, eg investors, founders, or engineers. 4. Write down your friends and past and current colleagues who you think are a) most likely to be successful and b) you’d most enjoy working with. Or even just who you most like, trust, and admire. Then see where they work. And ask them about other companies they know. The simplest version of this is go on LinkedIn, and browse your network, and click to check out the companies all of your past classmates and colleagues work at. 5. Go to events that would have interesting technologists in your field (ie the areas where you have skill and taste, so you can pick who you admire), and ask them where they work, and which startups they’ve been impressed by. Talks, conferences, meetups, maker spaces. 6. Biased self-promotion: I’m kind of obsessed with interesting startups and sometimes share lists of startups, eg https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957834156794343730 and https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1957446016950816866 7. HN who is hiring thread: there are lots of interesting ones there, you’ll just want to dig through to find them. 8. Look up university career fair company lists to see which companies are hiring, if they’re hiring new grads and interns then they’re very likely hiring senior engineers too. 9. Podcasts: some technologists have great podcasts, so do some investors and VC firms. 10. Search for startups founded by alumni from your school, you’re more likely to have alumni second degree connections there. I’ll note that investors get many bets, employees get one at a time. So you need a higher bar. Meeting in person is particularly high signal. My tip for filtering companies is to spend as much time as possible in person with the team before accepting an offer, ideally at least on 3+ separate occasions, with 3+ separate people. If there’s doubt, skip. This is also why it’s so good to start by identifying your most impressive friends and colleagues and see where they work, because you start with that high trust filter. reply",

          "text": "It’s a technique that will favor those skilled in BS — or more charitably, those skilled in social persuasion. And this is a risk for the founders, but there are plenty of cracked engineers who are also persuasive. The problem is they have little motivation to join a company with instability and looming uncertainty. So if the founders aren’t careful they’ll end up hiring someone more skilled at BS than any technical competency. I’ve been the founder in this position, and I’m confident in my ability to judge talent, so I don’t worry too much about the risk of hiring a BSer. I know that if I want to hire someone then they’re qualified. But at what price? Once I’ve decided I want to hire them, the cost of passing — and restarting the cycle — is too high to push back on high counteroffers, especially when the investors are pressuring us to hire fast. (fwiw, my next startup I will avoid raising any money until we have product/market fit… or at least I’ll tell the VCs pressuring me to hire too early to pound sand… this rushed hiring was a big contributor to the soft failure (acquihire), but I am proud we built a very strong team. For all our missteps and failures, hiring was not one of them.) reply",

          "text": "If you look at a lot of products out there that are basically what people want Siri to be (a truly integrated AI assistant), they either fall super flat (see rabbit r1) or are prohibitively expensive (see motion ai). Additionally, I think another one people forget is that Apple positioned itself with their marketing as the last bastion of privacy (I'm emphasizing marketing, not reality here), which gets contradicted with AI's current public perception. There's also the issue of choosing whether to keep things in the cloud or on device. One final major thing that I think Apple is considering: how could AI integration inadvertently cannibalize their app store profits?  If they're able to offer AI integration that other calendar, todo, etc. apps can't, how will that affect a user's purchasing decision?  If doing this would potentially eat into app store profits, then the next logical step is to create a system that allows developers to essentially have an API into the user's trained data, which is likely no small feat, especially if Apple is trying to obscure the data exposed to the app developer. reply",

Do they _want_ people using Siri?  Yes, it is actually a valuable feature for me to be able to get directions while driving or play a song while cooking.  Everything else has a weird cost-benefit ratio to Apple I imagine.  The things that make you think the iPhone is substantively more valuable because Siri can do them are hard.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It's the weekend. Let's do some brainstorming. What's forefront on your mind with regards to the human predicament, and how we move forward? \nWe all see that it seems pretty much everyone has gone insane, or at least that's what the narrative portrays. Why are companies, governments, and other organizations doing such stupid things? \nSo we've made machines that can appear to \"think\", by articulating linguistic constructs that make sense. In fact, there appears to be actual semantic and logical structure embedded within the neural networks of LLMs. Ok, let's keep our heads on straight, keep in mind the mathematics involved, chill out, and just think about what it is that we actually want (and what \"we\" are, for that matter). Are we going to someday transcend language? I'm aware that I'm typing this message out to you, using language, with hopes that this form of communication will become obsolete. But what will that look like? I know that human language in it's current form is severely limited. \nIf we're to design some future communication protocol and methodology, let's contemplate what types of things even need to be communicated? For example, what is \"the news\" nowadays? Could it be simply a video stream of the sunrise? Well it would take a long time to get there. In the meantime, it should probably be something like \"yeah, it's another day, and humans are doing the work necessary to put order to chaos and make things better for everyone\".<p>From a more concrete perspective, I'd say that we've reached the point when we can transcend the idea of what \"work\" is currently. We can see beyond the limited view of doing things for monetary profit, and see that certain systems could be implemented much better if there were certain forms of entity-organization and resource-allocation at play. What is a company if it's ran by a computer? What does it serve? I mean, it sounds silly to suggest some big companies with overlapping domains of operation should consolidate their operations, but we all know that that's where things should be headed in many cases.<p>So yeah, what's your vision for the future?</p></p></div>",

          "text": "My vision for the future includes greatly reducing the power requirements for AI by rethinking computing using first principles thinking. Every single attempt at this so far wasn't willing to go far enough, and ditch the CPU or RAM.  FPGAs got close, but they went insane with switching fabrics and special logic blocks. Now they've added RAM, which is just wrong. Edit/Append: I've had this idea [1] forever (since the 1990s, possibly earlier... don't have notes going that far back).  Imagine the simplest possible compute element, the look up table... arranged in a grid.  Architectural optimizations I've pondered over time lead me to a 4 bits in, 4 bits out look up table, with latches on all outputs and a clock signal. This prevents race conditions by slowing things down. The gain is that you can now just clock a vast 2d array of these cells with a 2 phase clock (like the colors on a chessboard) and it's a universal computer, Turing complete, but you can actually think about it without your brain melting down. The problem (for me) has always been programming it and getting a chip made.  Thanks to the latest \"vibe coding\" stuff, I've gotten out of analysis paralysis, and have some things cooking on the software front.  The other part is addressed by TinyTapeout, so I'll be able to get a very small chip made for a few hundred dollars. Because the cells are only connected to neighbors, the runs are all short, low capacitance, and thus you can really, REALLY crank up the clock rates, or save a lot of power. Because the grid is uniform, you wont have the hours or days long \"routing\" problems that you have with FPGAs. If my estimates are right, it will cut the power requirements for LLM computing by 95%.

On the superintelligence front, focusing on empathetic LLMs for companionship taps into real societal issues like rising loneliness (e.g. reports from the WHO highlight it as a global health threat).\nThis approach risks exacerbating dependency rather than alleviating it, potentially creating echo chambers of artificial interaction over genuine human bonds.

Honestly, I consider those two pretty different questions. At the very least, I'd approach them very differently in terms of time-scale. What's \"top of mind\" for me is more about the short-term threats I perceive to our way of life, whereas my \"vision for the future\" is - to my way of thinking - more about how I'd like things to be in some indeterminate future (that might never arrive, or might arrive long after my passing). To the first question then: what's on my mind? 1. The rise of authoritarianism and right-wing populism, both in the US and across the world. 2. The increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence systems, and the specter of continued advances exacerbating existing problems of unequal wealth / power imbalances / injustice / etc. Combine (1) and (2) and you have quite a toxic stew on your hands in the worst case. Now I'm not necessarily predicting the worst case, but I wouldn't bet money that I couldn't afford to lose against it either. So worst case, we wind up in a prototypical cyberpunk dystopia, or something close to it. Only probably less pleasant than the dystopias we are familiar with from fiction. And even if we don't wind up in a straight up \"cyberpunk dystopia\", one has to wonder what's going to happen if fears of AI replacing large numbers of white-collar jobs come true. And note that that doesn't have to happen tomorrow, or next year, or 5 years from now or whatever. If it happens 15 years, or 25 year, or 50 years, or whatever, from now, the impact could still be profound. So even for those of you who are dismissive of the capabilities of current AI systems, I encourage you to think about the big picture and play some mental simulations with different rates of change and different time scales. reply",

Backing out of setup on every startup is possible --- but it is often a multi-step process that becomes extremely annoying.

Smart TVs are actually cheaper --- which make no sense until you realize they are counting on recurring revenue from privacy invasion. They try to strong arm you into connecting the TV to the internet --- unless you run the TV in store demo mode. Also, the picture quality on lower ends models differ from the more expensive ones primarily because their bightness, contrast and color saturation controls are artificially limited --- except when run in store demo mode. So my solution is to buy a low end smart TV and run it in demo/store mode without connecting it to the internet. Whereupon, it it will act just like a dumb TV with the brightness and contrast jacked up to simulate the more expensive models. reply",
