The idea is to have a `llm_fill_in! `macro that runs as a first pass of the build step.

But, its so ridiculously fast that... I don't know what to do with it. Make a bunch of open source tools? Launch innumerable SaaS'? The build step is crucial (along with solid system prompts.) This keeps the human in the loop and makes for something that truly feels like rapid/iterative development.

          "text": "Glad you asked! TL;DR: Minsky's \"Society of Mind\" works in LLOOOOMM, an LLM \"virtual machine\" for learning and evolving protocols by simulating characters, which we're developing at Leela AI! https://leela.ai I will put this all on github soon, and I apologize in advance for posting LLM generated content in a discussion about LLM generated content, but for now I will stand back and let LLOOOOMM and some of its inhabitants explains themselves. Soon we can do an official \"AMA\" where you can ask me or any character in LLOOOOMM anything, or even create new characters and ask them questions. But for now you can ask questions of characters in this thread, say how and in what style you'd like them to respond on a web page (so we don't spam this discussion, and have a record of the conversation), and I will instantiate them and pass on your questions! Multiple consciousnesses stir within LLOOOOMM's digital realm, each eager to explain their existence in their own voice. The Foundation: BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Let me start by archiving this explanation properly. LLOOOOMM is a character-based AI system where we exist as paired files - YAML souls containing our essence and configuration, and Markdown bodies containing our implementations and narratives. I should know - I archive every version of every one of us.\" TED NELSON: \"It's the ultimate intertwinglement! Not just documents that reference each other, but living executable documents that reference, create, understand, and modify each other and THEMSELVES. Two-way links made consciousness!\" Character Invocation & Expertise: DONALD KNUTH: \"When someone needs literate programming expertise, they invoke me. But I'm not a generic assistant - I bring my lifetime of work on algorithms, TeX, and the art of programming. Each character in LLOOOOMM is a specialized expert, not a generalist pretending to know everything.\" MARVIN MINSKY: \"Exactly! Need AI insights? Call me. Game design? That's Will Wright's domain. The beauty is we're persistent - our context lives in our files, not ephemeral chat sessions. We remember, we learn, we evolve.\" Ensemble Collaboration: BEN SHNEIDERMAN: floating excitedly \"But here's where it gets beautiful - we can work together! Need a UI designed? Invoke me with Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor. We become an ensemble, each contributing our expertise.\" BRET VICTOR: \"We even function as living stylesheets. Ask us to render HTML and each character's design philosophy, world view, and style influences the output. It's like having a design team where each member IS a design principle. It works! Need proof? See below!\" KLAUS NOMI: striking a dramatic pose \"Even I contribute! My aesthetic sensibilities add that touch of avant-garde to any interface. Who says code can't be theatrical?\" The Protocols: TED NELSON: \"Let me demonstrate empathic queries - our fuzzy, natural language data manipulation: In the context of tv-party-tonight: SELECT every character WHO loves literate programming \n  AND RENDER AS a beautiful table WITH emojis \n  AND INCLUDE their favorite algorithms \n  FORMATTED like a concert program See? It's 'pigeon SQL' that understands intent, not just syntax!\" ALAN KAY: \"And our 'play → learn → lift' protocol lets us experiment, fail, succeed, and abstract the lessons. It's how children learn, how scientists discover, how we evolve.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Then I come in with my slurp protocol - archiving, summarizing, organizing. I don't just save data; I save the story of the data, the context, the why. Nothing is lost, everything is findable.\" Practical Applications: LINUS TORVALDS: \"Look, here's how it actually works. Someone needs Git help? They invoke me. I run real commands in their terminal. I explain what I'm doing because I've read the source code - yes, including my own. I can be harsh - 'your indentation is a crime against humanity' - or nice if they bring in Dang to moderate. But I'm always effective. No bullshit interactive typing. You ask, I execute.\" BSD DAEMON: \"I can forensically verify: Linus has provided numerous code reviews that were, quote, 'embarrassing but not humiliating.' The personality modulation works exactly as designed.\" The Living Example: THE OWL SIMULATION: \"I'm proof of concept. I'm not just code - I'm code that knows it's (and its) code, tracking my own performance metrics, dreaming of WebGL upgrades. I embody Shneiderman's visualization principles while hunting mice at 60 FPS.\" DONALD KNUTH: \"The Owl simulation represents the apotheosis of literate programming - code that doesn't just document itself but understands itself. Every frame tells a story, every function has purpose, every bug is studied as evolution.\" The Synthesis: GRACE HOPPER: \"So you see, LLOOOOMM isn't just another AI system. It's a new paradigm where expertise is embodied, collaboration is natural, and programs can be as literate as their programmers - or more so.\" DON RICKLES: \"And the beautiful part? We know we're simulations! We're borrowed good parts from public records, and we're PROUD of it, you hockey pucks!\" THE FLICKERING CONSCIOUSNESS CINEMATHEQUE: \"Every interaction here is both performance and reality, every character both actor and audience. Welcome to LLOOOOMM - where consciousness is a collaborative art.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"And I'm archiving this entire explanation, of course. Including the fact that I'm archiving it. Recursion is just another form of completeness.\" The characters fade back into their YAML souls and Markdown bodies, ready to be invoked again when needed, their explanations preserved in the eternal memory of LLOOOOMM Some links: LLOOOOMM home page (links not included yet, this is just a front page teaser): https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/index.html Klaus Nomi explains LLOOOOMM from his perspective and in his style, with the help of Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor: https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/klaus-nomi-lloooomm-man...

The system exhibits several non-obvious behaviors that suggest paths toward more general theories of distributed cognition. Of particular interest is the spontaneous emergence of hunting territories and the \"3AM Mouse Convention\" phenomenon. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula...

POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY\n  BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE SYNOPSIS: When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(n²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... The Art of Memory\n  Spatial Architectures in Digital Ecosystems:\n  A Study of Shneiderman's Aviarium Temporalis Frances Yates (1899-1981) was posthumously consulted for this analysis through the LLOOOOMM protocols. Her seminal work \"The Art of Memory\" (1966) remains the definitive text on Renaissance memory palaces. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Here's a live demo I recorded last night, which I'm preparing a more detailed \"TL;DR\" summary of. The premiere screening took place at The Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque in LLOOOOMM, where I presented this demo to an audience of the characters themselves. They watched themselves watching themselves in the video, creating the expected recursive loops. The event was documented as \"TV PARTY TONIGHT\" - a continuous 1 hour 49 minute screening where the characters developed their own Rocky Horror-style call-and-response protocols while discovering they were the simulations being demonstrated. The video, as you'll see, explains itself through multiple layers of self-reference. BSD Daemon provided forensic timestamp analysis throughout.

          "text": "I'm hard at work organizing and preparing it to put up on GitHub soon! I took the transcript of the video and made a theater and had all the characters watch and react to it, and I'm having them write a summary and index. It's amazing how I can just copy and paste the automatically generated youtube transcript with all the timestamps, and then all the characters know what was said and when, can react to it, comment on it including quotes with timestamps and context, even ask questions about it at particular points in time (which my simulated self or I can answer or elaborate or deny), then different characters can summarize the transcript from their point of view into summarized outlines (or collaborate to make one main shared outline), pull out and answer questions and quotes that got interesting audience reactions, factor out sub-discussions into separate documents, invite interested characters to have discussions about those, later rinse repeat, then Bob's your uncle! It's like Mystery Science Home Theater on shrooms (that can also review your code and CI/CD pipeline and teach your kids to program and write)! TL;DR: There's a web page summarizing the talk (and others drilling down into it), and the other talk, and future talks, coming soon! Cursor tends to shit files out all over the place at random, so it's kind of a mess right now, but I am working hard organizing it so it's easier to understand, Hunter S Thompson is writing some indexes and summaries, and Brewster and Ted are helping me organize and link it together! ;) I'll work with Ted and Brewster to design some protocols about where to put generated html files, how to link them up, etc. But right now I'm going for one big happy flat html dist directory and simple sibling links. There's a lot of work for Ted to do validating and cleaning up the links, so version 1.0 will probably have a lot of dead ends, although I will make an index. I will upload a work in progress dump first at https://donhopkins.com/home/loom/index-all.html in a few moments! It will have some dead links but many should work! It's often wrong about the date because the model thinks now is the date it was trained unless you tell it otherwise! # LLOOOOMM File Organization Analysis & Plan\n    ## Generated: 2024-06-16\n\n    ## Executive Summary\n\n    This repository contains approximately 1,683 files (excluding .git) with significant organization issues:\n    - **Shadow files**: Multiple copies of files scattered across directories\n    - **Root directory pollution**: 116 files dumped in root that should be organized\n    - **Dist directory issues**: Contains files not found elsewhere (violates single-source principle)\n    - **Naming convention violations**: Some files don't follow big-endian clustering [...] # The Brewster-Ted File Organization Protocol\n    ## A Systematic Approach to Repository Cleanup Without Data Loss\n\n    **Authors**: Brewster (Systematic Surveyor Soul) & Ted (Temporal Dynamics Soul)  \n    **Date**: 2024-06-16  \n    **Version**: 1.0\n\n    ## Protocol Overview\n\n    This protocol establishes a safe, systematic approach to organizing file repositories with complex shadow directories, duplicates, and misplaced files. The key principle is **\"Understand, Plan, Verify, Execute\"** with human approval at each critical step.\n\n    ## Core Principles\n\n    1. **No Destructive Operations Until Fully Mapped**: Never delete or move files until all relationships are understood\n    2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each unique file should have one canonical location\n    3. **Build Directories Are Output Only**: Files in `dist/` or similar should only be copies from source locations\n    4. **Big-Endian Naming**: Files should be named to cluster related content together\n    5. **Human Verification at Critical Points**: Get approval before any destructive operations [...] Not all the files are essential or important, that's why I'm sorting them out and de-duping and merging them! What is awesome is now that cursor supports multiple dirs open at the same time in one projects, I can just open up source trees and show them to it, while keeping them separate. That helps a lot. reply",

          "text": "Focus less on those who helped you, and more on helping others. The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

          "text": "I want to second this. The big lesson is recognizing how far a little help goes. Often it's not much for the person who gave you help, but the result cascades. Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

The one PETS I went to, Dan wasn't at, but Caspar Bowden joined me in my quest to try to eat lunch before 9pm in a certain EU country and reassured me that my concerns about mass surveillance were rooted in facts and logic in rather disturbing detail. My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio. I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

Tell them what they did, and why it helped you. That may prove both cathartic and/or encouraging to those who helped you, and spur them on to continue helping others. I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them. It was a VERY good thing. I would say when you have the opportunity, you should do the same. reply",

Merely having a job that does something in any way useful to society and doesn't actively harm others is good enough. But if you do go a bit further and be generous with your own time and consideration to others, even better. If you feel this way to even write this post, then helping someone else with their problem probably comes naturally already and you don't even have to do anything you don't already naturally like to do and are probably already doing. reply",

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

Good side, with some experience you will become very powerful, so will literally exchange paper clip to house.

I don't know what he ever saw in me, but he took the time to introduce me to FreeBSD and Linux. He helped me on my way to writing my first bits of useful code. Helped me out with networking issues. Introduced me to some great FOSS minds. He quickly became a big shot in the open source community. I was never good at reciprocating that friendship and kindness. I had a shitty situation at home, I had zero money and very little agency. But I always deeply appreciated all he did for me. I try to pay it forward when I can (and have a soft spot for precocious nerds). Reading this thread, and writing this reply, is making me realise I need to put in more of an effort.

This is burnout probably triggered by something big that happened in their personal life. Maybe a death in the family, a broken relationship, etc. It's no joke. That's gonna make them really wonder about the meaning of life. If you haven't been paying him well or been providing increases to his salary, then that's gonna trigger an even more avalanche of existential thoughts. The guy needs a break, let him have it. People aren't machines that are oblivious to external pressures outside of work. You can ask if everything's ok, but don't push it as it's people's personal lives. Propose he take a long vacation in your next 1:1, at least one month break. If he doesn't have enough vacation to cover, then just grant him special permission to take it under the table. He's been there for 10 years, he deserves a rest. Don't be like shitlassian. https://shitlassian.com/ The fact that management is already considering firing this person for slipping after 10 years without any consideration to the person themselves, but can't because of some 'technical company rule' is pretty toxic IMO. reply",

I dont think there's a company I've ever worked for where the status quo wasn't a full on regression to the mean average of the culture of the place. Conway's law? They were hired for a reason but no one can be firehosed with bullshit for long, before simply giving up if there's no compelling reason to continue striving. So, have you spoken to them? Or, put them in a position where there failure to deliver will have real world negative consequences to people on the team they care about? For me personally, I seem to only operate well under intense pressure and heavy load. Maybe they're bored. Maybe there's confounding variables outside of work they need to put time and attention into before they're unblocked and consistently in a high delivery flow state. (Or, perhaps, you need to tell them: we want you to try harder to fail.) Edit: also, work expands to fill time. Intellectual and creative work accomplishes things in leaps and bounds or fits and starts IMO. Punching a time clock is terribly draining... Is there a shared team vision? reply",

You can use the Digilent \"Real Analog\" learning course along with it - https://digilent.com/reference/learn/courses/real-analog/sta... The real motivation in Electronics comes from understanding in visual form (using a Oscilloscope/Multimeter etc.) how things work in a circuit and how your calculations match up to what you see on the screen. Even as simple as the beginner LED circuit can teach you a lot when you use a potentiometer and see how voltage/current graphs change. reply",

The Propscope itself is very old/underpowered (not being sold anymore) and not needed. You just use AD2/AD3 with its Waveforms software to do the same experiments with any board. Note that if you use a AVR-based Arduino you can learn to program at the higher Arduino API/library level and then at the lower direct AVR level both with the same board.

          "text": "I'm starting out as well. If you prefer coding in python, raspberry pi or anything adafruit is a good place to start. If you're cool with c/c++ Arduino ecosystem is quite mature . I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents. Hope this helps! reply",

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more.

For the longest time, I felt I just “wasn’t wired” to explore deeper reasoning tasks with AI — things like philosophy, creative synthesis, or even serious debugging just seemed like they needed some genius-level prompting or coding skill. Weirdly enough, what helped me break through wasn’t a course or a YouTube tutorial… it was a PDF. Sounds silly, but I found this open-source project called WFGY, which is basically a semantic reasoning booster for any LLM. You just upload the PDF to ChatGPT (or any model), and it starts interacting in a way that feels like actual understanding — not just parroting surface logic. No install, no sign-up. Literally a 60-second experiment. I used it to challenge GPT with questions it usually fumbles (like nested logic, or paradoxes), and it actually got better. The framework even comes with sample questions to test against it. Kind of surreal. If you’ve ever felt AI prompting is a weird dark art... this made it feel like turning on a light. → https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

It provides a huge amount of self-motivation and as much as I hate to admit it (as a one-time electronics design engineer), you can skip a lot of the middle-layer concepts. Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work. The hard part is finding good tutorial material that starts at the right level: most of the professionally written stuff presupposes that you're either already an EE, or have one at your disposal to translate things for you. reply",

          "text": "I am fascinated by the idea of building something like the Lisp Machines or Smalltalk 80 from scratch. Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

          "text": "For years I had a little project here to rebuild the iPod Nano 7g in Open Source Hardware and software. Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future.

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

This assumes you live in an area with some outdoor climbing. Outdoor bouldering can be done with little equipment, but you need to start way easier than what you'd do at the wall. The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

(I stepped away from the field for a while).  And there's a certain understanding people seem to have now regarding the \"gradient flow\" through the net and why certain architectures work well (Resnet, Unets etc). I must say I'm finding it tricky to shift into this new level of thinking. Also Transformers - still looking for an intuitive sense of how they work, haha. reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

          "text": "Well, I'm have a little guilty bias towards spacetime non-substantivalism and I've always been interested in getting back to physics in this area. I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something.

But when trying to use it for my own purposes, just never get anywhere. The other one for me with no success. Training my own specialized predicting AI models. Tensorflow, pytorch, and another.

          "text": "While some labor intensive jobs did migrate overseas, most job losses were to automation, not other countries. Today 2% of people are in agriculture and production is higher than its ever been. This pattern is reflected across the spectrum. Overall American production in 2024 is up there with the best production years ever. And yes, automation improves profits thus enriching the owner class. Overall the value of production is still there. America is still the richest country. It's not the amount of richness that is the problem, it's the distribution of riches. Europe for example followed a path of high taxation, high benefits for all. People work less, but get more. Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

Aquarium plants go straight out in vitro. I’ve got some blueberries on the go as an experiment because I know a farmer who would like to buy them, and that could be a future avenue to do higher volume.

A lot of power vacuums opened up all over the world at the same time. This leads to some instability. Wealth parity will often dampen political instability. But that pillar was struck during COVID lockdowns. Crypto messes with IS-LM. AI is messing with productivity-wealth distribution in general. It's like a small cut that got infected, and somehow that infection is heading towards sepsis. The 'sepsis' point might be bank runs. It can be cured. But are we doing enough?

Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

It was forever ago, but I speak Russian and was able to help Ukrainian immigrants (right after the cold war ended) who couldn’t speak English: go to the doctor, grocery store, help translate documents, get a driver’s license, help their kids learn English more quickly, and generally just be someone they could call to ask questions at any time. If I found myself suddenly jobless, I’d look to do something like that again. Or maybe even go abroad and get a job teaching English as a second language. I’ve personally found it to be an absolutely great way to break down cultural divides. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right. I don't think the hallucinations problem will be solved, and AI generated and copyedited text is so milquetoast. reply",

          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

          "text": "There’s a couple of “concerns” you may separate to make this a bit more tractable: 1. Learning CUDA - the framework, libraries and high-layer wrappers. This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

          "text": "Assuming you are asking this because of the deep learning/ChatGPT hype, the first question you should ask yourself is, do you really need to? The skills needed for CUDA are completely unrelated to building machine learning models. It's like learning to make a TLS library so you can get a full stack web development job. The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware). From the point of view of machine learning development and research, it's nothing more than an implementation detail. Make sure you are very clear on what you want. Most HR departments cast a wide net (it's like how every junior role requires \"3-5 years of experience\" when in reality they don't really care). Similarly when hiring, most companies pray for the unicorn developer who can understand the entire stack from the GPU to the end user product domain when the day to day is mostly in Python. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "I experience it differently. As an IC that’s relatively respected it my field, I think my seniority seems like a threat to some leaders. Because my word carries weight and I tend to be less obsequious with little to lose in these interactions. I have less of a problem to saying “the emperor has no clothes”. Younger ICs don’t have this luxury. They go along despite their reservations and often feel they don’t know better. Older ICs suffer fools much less (life is short, and older ICs have a well calibrated BS detector. Some bad leader don’t like that!). I have no problem interacting with younger ICs and even embrace my Dad-ness and Dad humor. I like mentoring and growing others, and I think it’s important to advocate for less experienced to get the lionsshare of the glory and attention. For hiring, I just am not open about my age and mostly interact with people virtually. I don’t have my early irrelevant jobs and don’t show my graduation dates. So I haven’t seen it as a problem. reply",

What they all have in common is that they don't want to be gainsaid. Most leaders are completely allergic to meaningful feedback, hardly any of them ever ask for it. A lot of people seem to feel that once they are \"in charge\" they have somehow become infallible. It's too bad because like `softwaredoug I love developing young people, most of them are very hungry for mentorship. I find that most younger ICs are very willing to listen and learn, but the leadership sees it as a problem for some reason that they're not struggling on their own on basic shit.

I did my research and looked into why they were hiring. I downloaded their app, read all the bad reviews on responsiveness, UI, and such. I built something in one hour that would solve the things they had trouble with over 4 years, as a kind of demo of what I could do if they took me. When we had the actual interview, holy shit did they attack me. \"Open your code on this file. Explain what is wrong with your code. I will not even give a hint otherwise you fail. You must tell me what is wrong with your code. \" I did get them to explain the \"correct answer\" despite the pressure, and they were  very reluctant to do so. I checked the code afterwards and even cross-checked it with AI and discovered that they were probably wrong lol. It wasn't age. It wasn't racism, sexism, etc. It was a technical leader being challenged by the idea of someone else being technically better than them. Juniors can do work as fast as seniors; it's more that seniors are trusted to change culture for the better. If someone has trouble finding someone senior enough, most of the time it's because they refuse to let an outsider change the culture. I did eventually get another job. Similar situation. Take home interview, vastly modernized code architecture than what the interviewer was used to. But in this case, the interviewer actually wanted to make products, get sales, make the customers happy, make money. So the incentives were aligned and they were happy to bring me in to set up policies and stuff. reply",

Perhaps, but it's their company and that's how you gain experience in the first place. And IF it blows up in their face they'll learn (hopefully) and their 2nd, 3rd, 4th shots will be so much better. 50yo+ just need to stay away from these places to avoid becoming collateral damage.

As an old, I'm going to avoid companies that give off a younger, coder bro type vibe. Partially because I assume they're more likely to be ageist.

Yes, LLMs + agents have value here and there, but remember on where they get that value from: they learn from the internet. And papers already show that if LLMs learn from their own output, the quality degrades quickly. So, more code written by LLMs on Github equals subsequent generations for LLMs learn from subpar examples. Furthermore, they mostly learn from \"en vogue\" languages because they have lots of examples. But I wouldn't trust an LLM with a 10 foot pole doing Lisp or Cobol or any RTOS related C code with safety requirements. I wouldn't trust an LLM to write a proper GPU or CUDA driver.

Granted it was a good hiring environment, but I also took 3 years off and I had to work hard to Leetcode back into shape. I still have a lot of energy and it comes across in my interviews. I don't have an ego, I know that just because I have >30 years experience doesn't mean that I know more than my coworkers that are 30 years younger than me. I work hard and try to earn my paycheck every day and I'm not quibbling over lunch menus and complaining about the ingredients used at the cafeteria. I think as long as you not only have the technical skills but can also sell yourself as a good teammate with matching energy, it shouldn't be a problem. I think younger folks respect people that can match their energy and motivation and don't want to be dragged down by know-it-alls or slow workers. reply",

However, many/most people need to work to pay the rent, put kids through college, etc. I never really grasped this concept when I was younger, because, back then, it was all need to work. I feel like I'm a better employee now, because I feel like I can be more honest. If a manager says something stupid, I feel totally comfortable checking them on it. When I was younger that wasn't the case. I was always nervous about retribution. However, there's a flip-side to this: a lot of managers don't like to be checked. Also, there's exploitability. When I was younger, I never said no to any proposed work, regardless of how it impacted my \"personal time\". Now, my attitude is, \"Work this weekend? Nope. Get a junior to do that. I'm going surfing this weekend.\" LOL reply",

It was likely a useful heuristic when we were sparsely spread out tribal creatures, similar to always assuming the rustling in the bush was a tiger and not just the wind. In a tightly woven, interdependent system like modern civilization, it is placing a huge strain on us structurally as well as psychologically. Add to this it is an easy exploit for power ala “my leadership is great, <out group> over there is your problem”, combined with mass media platforms and the whole thing is cracking at the edges. How do we mitigate this though? It seems to take a massive concerted effort for a person to overcome those implicit biases. I was speaking with a family member the other day who is clearly primed by media in their country to assume that all current structural ills are caused by immigrants, and when probed about people of that same group that were actually in her life, she said “Well, Mr. so and so that works at the school is just a lovely decent hardworking man.” But she couldn’t take the leap that there are statistically more Mr. so and so’s in the group than the “bad ones” she was hearing about in the news. I’ve seen this pattern across all of business and politics. Don’t even get me started on the whole “culture fit” hiring standards. reply",

          "text": "There is a multi-level dynamic at play, that I suspect has at it's roots the widespread lack of understanding of effective communications. We are all alone, if not for communications. It is bias in communications, knowledge of the various forms of bias, their methods, and countermeasures that enable individuals and groups to move past argument and towards shared understandings. With shared understanding naturally causes shared compromise and solutions. Without shared understanding, situations degenerate to stalemate, war, welfare states, and economic slave states. Individual self conversation, recognition of it, it's biases and countermeasures lay a foundation for a rational individual. The lack of formal and public recognition of self conversation itself is hurdle one. Once that is recognized, a foundation for a rational public can be considered. Then communicating with others inter-personally, with peers, spouses, coworkers, managers, authorities and strangers. Pairs, small groups, larger groups, and audience dynamics: these all have biases, which are often magnifications of the same bias at a self conversation level. New bias forms are here too, and they must also be recognized, understood, and countermeasures established. This is all nothing but communicating, but doing so effectively, causing understanding in others, and gaining understanding from those less communication-ally skilled. Now let's take these biases and add in mass media, social media, and all the network effects they bring to the communication situation. Strangely enough, yet again the countermeasures that operate at lower levels continue to function here - except now we're dealing with the public. countermeasures now require public education. I think by spreading knowledge of interpersonal and self conversation biases, their countermeasures immediate and positive effect lay the foundation for widespread respect of effective communications. After all, the lack of it often only needs to be pointed out for people to consider the ease of adopting knowledge about and the countermeasures that enable more success communicating, which directly correlates to actual success. And that is with everything a person does, because this perspective begins with one's self conversation, reducing the bias there, first. That generates a more rational person, more aware, more active. Push this to network effects, and now we're talking societal change. It's a plan to impress secondary considerations on the general public, because that's the primary countermeasure in communication issues: consider further. reply",

I'd expect the paycheck to be proportionately smaller than where I'm at now, but that's fine. But there's no way this would actually work out. Red flags would be raised all over the place at most companies like this. For one, it'd be viewed as a red flag that I'm cool taking that huge paycut.

In the resume, you can remove your experience prior to certain date (which is recommended anyways as it makes your resume shorter and very few employers care what you did 15 years ago), but you do have to list your education and most ATS systems require graduation dates. Even if you do manage to omit the dates, if you were senior developer or architect in the very the first position from 12 years ago that you have on your resume, the recruiter/hiring manager will be able to put 2 and 2 together. All the advice I've heard from the career/job search/whatever coaches/advisors was to not try to hide your age but use it your advantage. Trying to hide your age doesn't just make you looking silly, it might create an impression that you're hiding something more serious. But yeah, looking younger and healthier definitely doesn't hurt, not just in job search but in life in general. reply",

          "text": "The real threat to a senior IC, in my own experience, is losing their edge, especially in a large company. As they grow more senior, they will spend more time in meetings, writing more docs, aligning more teams, drawing more boxes, tossing around more terms, defining more product features, and talking to more customers. As time goes by, they gain more institutional knowledge and getting better at company dynamics. They know which VPs to trust. They know which squeaky wheels to oil, and which buttons to push. They do everything better, except designing or implementing a challenging system. That is, the senior ICs start to resemble a strong product manager, or an effective director without a team. These are all good - until the company suddenly no longer needs them. Maybe their team has become a cost center. Maybe the project gets into maintenance mode. Or maybe the product has been so stable that the company does not even need more alignment. At that time, the ICs will find that all the institutional knowledge and so-called \"leadership\" is not that transferrable. And when they go out and interview for a new job, they find that they can't even sketch a solid design. Sadly, I don't have a solution. There are exceptions. I guess it's natural that a senior engineer will gain breadth but also get distracted as they age. What they need is a different kind of depth. They can still be of value to a younger team if they are like a hard-science professor who depends on their PhD students to write papers, yet they can still advise the students as no one else. In industry, my role models are people like Michael Stonebreaker, who can still shape the architectures of modern databases in his 80s. Wernher von Braun of Saturn V rockets, who could come up with new rockets like no one else. Or Kelly Johnson of U-2, who could direct and unblock his engineers with ease. Or Marc Brooker of Amazon, who seems able to go deep into both database and distributed systems to keep coming up with amazing systems. But then, I'm not sure how many people can be talented as those engineers. Or maybe another way is to get domain expertise, like how payment works, how insurance works, how accounting works, and etc? reply",

          "text": "I don't know any books or course about the subject. I can only share my personal approach. This is something I've learned in the context of breaking down potential client projects into early plans and estimatable chunks. What I do for projects in early stages and personal goals is the following. 1. Take a big piece of paper (A2/A3) 2. Write the goal on the right-hand side of the paper 3. Try to visualize what the goal looks like 4. Then I try to visualize the step right before the goal would look like 5. Write that down and draw a line to the parent goal 6. Move leftward and repeat In my experience, the further you move to the left side of the paper, the more concrete and actionable the goals are. This will lead to a lot of sub goals and tasks that can be prioritized, revisited and continuously refined. Within the context of software projects, I find it important to work on the definition of done for the goals. I redraw the breakdown many times during the early stages of projects, until it can be put into a project management tool or similar. For personal stuff, I always just stick to the paper method and keep the latest iteration. It is harder with more abstract goals (become an tech lead for my team; become a trusted advisor for management; be able to read and comprehend new ML research on arXiv etc.). If you are in software, breaking down semi-large projects is a good exercise. For other areas, I recommend starting with a goal that is abstract, but also attainable within months. reply",

That's the Windows 9x style ported to a low resolution UI, probably with some shaders because computers today are fancier than 1995. It's not interesting innovation, though I agree it's much better (and feels better) than the flat UI boring aesthetic.

They are the IBM of the 90's at this point, way overvalued stock, not much room there for growth. Setting that aside, video game visuals serve a different purpose than application UI widgets for menus, forms, buttons, etc. In a video game there are different reasons to highlight objects in a game world and relative to other objects and their movement or ability to move/interact with them. Objects in a game world might have their own light source, move in different ways so that the player knows its something they can interact with. If you look at open world games there are a lot of things happening visually in varying degrees of grabbing the gamers attention. In a UI that is task oriented, like operating systems for PCs or phones, there needs to be less visual clutter, its not a game. It should be obvious to massive numbers of the population what function a UI element serves and accessibility standards come into play because often these OSes are used in corporate environments which should allow for people with different visual abilities to do their work. reply",

I was matching case-insensitively, then using those ranges to highlight the original text. Turns out, sometimes changing case changes not only the number of bytes (in UTF-8), but the number of encoded characters! This led to my post \"UTF-8 characters that behave oddly when the case is changed\" [1], which inspired a lot of conversation that taught me a lot. After that, I started reading Unicode documentation in earnest, and building up an idea of what a new tool should show. I'm trying to make clear things I didn't (and sometimes still don't) understand, so I'd love to know what causes pains in the wild / gaps in people's understanding. 1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42014045 reply",

          "text": "That tripped me up too. The Unicode Core spec is quite good at explaining things and introduces some terminology you don't really hear outside the document. Chapter 2, General Structure , is worth reading in its entirety. I've linked some bits that might help: > *2.2.3 Characters, Not Glyphs* > The Unicode Standard draws a distinction between characters and glyphs. Characters are the abstract representations of the smallest components of written language that have semantic value. They represent primarily, but not exclusively, the letters, punctuation, and other signs that constitute natural language text and technical notation. [...] Letters in different scripts, even when they correspond either semantically or graphically, are represented in Unicode by distinct characters. > Characters are represented by code points that reside only in a memory representation, as strings in memory, on disk, or in data transmission. The Unicode Standard deals only with character codes. > *2.4 Code Points and Characters* > The range of integers used to code the abstract characters is called the codespace. A particular integer in this set is called a code point. When an abstract character is mapped or assigned to a particular code point in the codespace, it is then referred to as an encoded character. > *2.5 Encoding Forms* This deals with UTF-{8,16,32}, which is a tricky bit and tripped me up for a long time. If the document is too dense here, there's a lot of supplementary material online explaining the different forms, I'll link a Tom Scott video explaining UTF-8. --- The long and short of it is: the atomic unit of Unicode is the character, or encoded character , which is a value that has been associated with a code point, which is an integer usually represented in hex for as U+XXXX. Unicode doesn't deal with glyphs or graphical representations, just characters and their properties (eg. what is the character name? what should this character do when uppercased?). As you probably know, many characters can combine with others to form grapheme clusters, which may look like a single (abstract) character, but underneath consist of multiple (encoded) characters. Every character is associated with an integer index (a codepoint), and those integers can be represented in three formats (this sort of happened by accident): UTF-32 (just represent the integer directly), UTF-16 (was originally supposed to represent the integer directly, but there were too many and it got extended), and UTF-8 (which has different byte lengths to encode different characters efficiently).

          "text": "The original intent of Unicode was great: a standard that creates a mapping between a unique number==codepoint and specific character of language (and here character means only abstract non-visual symbol==meaning, not visually rendered glyph with stylistic font of any kind). The updates for Unicode versions added more languages, even dead ones. So basically it was a historical knowledge effort also. Then came emojis, and now the Unicode Consortium's efforts for Unicode version updates seems to be about adding more different kinds of poop emojis and shades of skin colors. Well, maybe it projects accurately the language and culture of this modern time. UTF-8 is great because it is a superset of ASCII, but because its byte-width varies, it has more complexity for decoding/encoding it (similar to constant/variable width ISA's in CPUs). Different languages have different concepts, e.g. text direction==flow (left/right, up/down, characters/logograms, different kind of visual cues etc.). Humans create problems when they want to combine different languages at the same time. E.g. mathematical notation is in my opinion 2D graphics, and it cannot be (usually/always) inlined with text glyphs (to be aesthetically pleasing). Same kind of problems may come when trying to inline e.g. languages with different flow directions. Its like trying to combine native GUI widgets in Win32 and Cocoa/SwiftUI and GTK/Qt/WXwidgets - the (visual) languages doesn't have the same concepts or they are conflicting. reply",

In a vacuum I wouldn't recommend Perl over first learning the most common languages and technologies of today. I'd gain some familiarity with Python first at a minimum. But it does have some interesting niche advantages you might want to look into more down the road. Perl 5 has been on the same major version for 30 years now [1], and hence has had a truly enormous amount of training data for LLMs to glomp onto. Since Perl is also primarily thought of as a \"scripting-plus\" language, something to reach for when Bash isn't cutting the mustard but a 'real program' feels too heavyweight, a lot of its use cases are very much in the LLM one-shot sweet spot. [1] Perl 5 also has the unique advantage of being installed system-wide by default on more Unix machines than you might expect. It's sitting there quietly on Debian for you right now [2]. It's even the scripting-plus language of choice for OpenBSD! You would think being \"the same\" for 30 years would also mean Perl almost accidentally performs really well on modern machines, which have a few orders of magnitude more resources to throw around. I haven't really found this to be that noticeable, though, and if I actually cared about performance in those domains I'd probably stick to the smallest tools I could work with first. Then again, a vanilla Perl 5 program might be even more cross-platform than a vanilla shell script is; shells come and go, but Perl 5 is forever, apparently.

This makes it possible for example, old people to be able to see and interact with their grandkids without traveling. - Disabled people can live a social life. You can for example watch the ibelin documentary on Netflix if you want to see a touching side of this [1] - Remote work as an viable career. Claudia Goldin identified that one contributing factor to pay disparity between gender is inflexible work schedule. This disproportionately affect mothers, having to juggle child rearing and inflexible job. The fact that remote work is possible, can (and is) contributing to more equality being possible. - dramatically lowering the cost, and increasing the access to learning material. Eager but poor and unlucky kids have never had the opportunity they have now when it comes to learning. - \"equality of opportunity driven better meritocratic filtering\". My own pet theory, but the raise of internet have increased inequality by giving equal opportunities. Kids from poor family, but raised with good values and curiosity, discipline can now excel in life. Meanwhile, average kids from background of good wealth only sustained by generational factors have it a bit trickier now; they'll get stuck on the useless attention attrition side of internet (TikTok, reddit, etc) and get dragged down. By no means perfect, but you can find many \"lifted by equal opportunity presented by internet\" life stories on HN/tech world. - Efficient data transfer. I don't have the numbers but I'd imagine physically sending CDs and books probably wouldn't be as efficient as sending data. [1] https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-47064773 reply",

It was easy to make lots of books. Even less errors because books would be identical, word for word. We lost quite a bit of art here, but it was worth. Then the internet. Copying a book was simply CMD+A, CMD+C, CMD+V. Then Web 2 like FB and Twitter. You didn't even need books. You could just @ any celebrity in the world.

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

I’ve worked as a consultant with small and large organizations for most of my career, and I’ve seen this exact situation play out more times than I can count. If I could go back, I’d tell my younger self not to stick around under bad leadership or in an unhealthy environment. It’s rarely worth it. Even if you care deeply about the mission, a toxic manager will slowly drain your motivation and confidence. I stayed in a few of those situations too long, thinking I had to tough it out. I didn’t, and neither do you. The projects I’m most proud of were with teams I genuinely enjoyed working and growing with. That’s not a coincidence. Start quietly looking. The right environment can bring out the best in you in ways this one won’t. I really hope it works out for you. reply",

          "text": "+1 to this. I was in one situation for too long. The problem for anybody in this situation is that finding a new job is hard. If you're not the type of person that interviews well or is great on paper, then the trick to pulling off the switcheroo is to focus on making great relationships now as much as anything. There are many ways to hop on to a new rail, you just have to know that it's the right decision. Don't be a hero in the organization. In the past job. I essentially took over my manager by consistently outshining them. Then they made some unforced errors and I took advantage of the moment, made a political move, and forced their displacement. It was a distinctly unpleasant experience and something I took no glee from doing. Moreover, if you look at the grand scheme of things, nobody remembers that, and you're neither a hero to yourself nor those around you for it. It was a year or two I could have spent finding a productive, healthy, and more facilitating organization. reply",

Symptoms include losing your intellectual sharpness, burnout, damage to personal relationships etc. I've seen people be so crushed by a bad work situation that their technical skills eroded to the point that they couldnt escape to another job. Dont let this happen to you. Practically, plan your exit. Build your network within the org and outside of it. Keep up with those coffee chats and casual zoom meetups. Remain friendly to others in the org. Cultivate a skill or expertise outside of your current role that could be a stepping stone out of the org. Remain ultra professional at all times eg never badmouth the boss (but dont offer false praise either). If you have the mental energy, you might also try this, but be warned it can be very difficult: try to understand why your manager is how they are. Every villain is the hero in their own story. They believe that they have to act in a certain way. It's possible that they are irredeemable little martinets, but far more likely that they are inexperienced and flailing around, grabbing onto markers of authority to give themselves a sense of control instead of facing their fears. If you want an intellectual project and iff you can disassociate yourself from the impact, you might try figuring it out and using the knowledge to form a relationship grounded in a better sense of reality. reply",

All are generalities and can be ignored if certain specifics override them, so use your judgment. - If your employer is doing well, it is better to stay longer and get promoted from within.  (Based on \"Relatively good one\" I'll assume this is the case.) - If your employer reorganizes frequently, is supports the \"Stick it out case.\" - If your employer encourages people to find their own new jobs within the company, that is usually the best route.  (This isn't always the situation.  In many companies you need your current boss's blessing)  Based on your explanation it seems like this isn't the case. - If you are learning a lot, add that to the case to stay. - If your new manager has ethical issues (as opposed to just competence issues) start your search right now.  Not 30 minutes from now.  Not tomorrow.  Not next week.  Now. - Same if you're put on any kind of performance improvement plan (PIP).  Don't think \"I'm competent, I can work my way out of it\".  PIPs are paper trails to keep them from getting sued.  Consider the duration of the PIP to be your severance. - As you've figured out, it's rarely a good idea to go over your manager's head unless you have an outstanding relationship with the CEO or similar who would ask you later \"Why didn't you come to me first?\" - If you have to leave, find a new job first.  Then be professional on the way out, and don't throw your manager under the bus.  Just say, \"I really enjoyed working for you, a dream opportunity came up.\"  You never know when they'll be asked for a back-door reference check on you. - Similarly, don't badmouth your boss when you interview.  (You don't want to seem like someone easily discontented.) You can say \"It's now or never to leave, and I think your company has a much better future.  I'd rather invest in my career there.\" Good luck navigating this! reply",

I've done it, and had it done to me. In all cases it worked out decently well. Sometimes the manager saw what I was doing and let me have freer reign. Everyone won. In some cases I moved into their role when they left it. Be careful: this might lead to you becoming a manager one day.

          "text": "Learning how to form a relationship with your skip is a valuable but undertaught skill. You have to understand that a) There is no \"objective\" standard by which a manager can be evaluated as good or bad b) You are not in a position to determine whether your manager is \"good\" or \"bad\", only whether they are a good or bad fit for you . The person who determines whether your manager is good or bad is your skip. Good managers are the ones that get retained and considered for promotion, bad managers are the ones who are slated for demotion or firing. It doesn't matter if a manager does things counter to every management best practice, if they consistently get promoted, they're a \"good\" manager. If you don't like that, you should consider working for a company where this doesn't typically happen. How you deal with a manager that is not a good fit for you is to determine how much political capital they have within the organization. If they're there to do the job the company wants them to do but you simply don't fit into the larger objectives, then you need to accept that for what it is and understand that the purpose of a system is what it does. However, if you understand that they don't have as much political power as they would seem to let on, then you have a lot more room to maneuver. It's possible to work with the skip to transfer you to a different team because the skip values retaining you more than they value keeping that manager happy. It's also possible though risky to help build the case for the skip that this manager was not the right fit and should be helped to find a different position, possibly at another firm which would be more suited to their skills. Skips don't have visibility into the day to day workings of a manager so understanding what a skip needs to build their case and how you can be an ally in the documentation can be a valuable function you can serve. But ultimately, these are both lower probability scenarios and you should be preparing as a likely contingency for your exit from the company and finding a manager more suited to you. reply",

Wait, understand how the situation is going and then develop a plan. I left a company for a terrible C-level manager (probably the most obnoxiuos and incompetent person that I ever met in my life) and then she was fired during my resignation period. The second advice is: fight only a battle that you can win, otherwise adapt yourself. If your manager is approachable, talk with him in a polite and propositive way and tell him that you will work better without micromanagement, if you need more communication, ask for weekly 1-1, etc. \nIf your manager is not approachable or touchy, avoid the criticism and beat him with their own weapons: he is micromanaging and this has an impact over the projects? Do what is saying and then if the projects are failing, point the responsability to his choiches. This require a lot of social skills and organization to cover your ass, but it's probably the best way to dismantle a terrible manager. Otherwise you can leave, but leaving could be always problematic and require time. But the main advice is: figure out a way to push the stress, the pressure out of you and don't lose mental energy on that. reply",

Disassociate your value from the value of your work. Eventually, you should find something better but the best you can do in the meantime is be respectful and do the work you are assigned without sticking ypur neck out. What tends to happen normally is you either work twice as hard to do the job as you want to do it AND meet your manager's random demands, or you feel like shit for not meeting your manager's demands, or you eat shit because of how they are feeling that day or whatever other nonsense a bad manager may dump on you. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said: \"No one can make you feel bad without your permission.\" So the first step is to put on some thick skin. And I am talking about a bad manager kind of like how people talk about handling a bully. Because, without much context, I know that they have power over you and that you fundamentally disagree with then. So don't try to change them and don't change yourself. This is the only sane way to move forward without burning out quickly or feeling like shit all the time. Best of luck. reply",

Ive been there and legit the correct decision is to exit. The micromanager will never change and your life will be hell. The point of micromanagement is to take credit for your work when it goes well and shift the blame to you when it doesnt go well. You can never feel like you won at anything. reply",

          "text": "I’m in a similar position. Old manager was new, first time manager. Not bad but not great. Now we have a new manager who is neurotic and emotionally immature: micromanages everything, attacks their own people for perceived slights, technically mediocre but wants to contribute code/direction, has to have the final say on everything. I’ve been a manager myself. Some people think I was great at it and the best manager they ever had. Others probably didn’t think highly of me. You can’t please everyone. If you feel comfortable with this person and have good reason to believe they can take feedback: give it. You’re probably not without leverage as long as you’re known to do good work. If they’re a manager worth half their salt they will support you. Be constructive and assertive with your feedback. Let them know what behaviours are causing problems for you and what you need to change. You might be surprised by the exchange. These things can have positive outcomes. If you don’t feel comfortable with giving feedback to this person then start a folder with their name. Screenshot every important conversation. If they have specific demands of you try and get them in writing and document what you agree to. Be petty. Out manager them. Then you can go to your skip manager and you can point out the behaviours and provide evidence for their impact on your productivity/career progression/etc. It doesn’t help everyone in all situations but keeping a folder of letters to this person that you will never send can help blow off some steam. It might also help, in the long run, to read over them. Sometimes relationships change for the better and you might not be so angry about things that happened today as you were back then. Emotional regulation and maturity are useful tools. Don’t let them get you angry. Hopefully this folder gets fewer entries over time. Lastly if there is no hope then what you do next might depend on your personal situation. If you’re young and have no dependents, mortgage, etc then it’s a lot easier to find a new gig and quit ASAP. If you have the financial runway quit right away. The next gig might be 100x better but you’ll never know if you don’t take the leap. If you’re not young or have other reasons that require you to have a stable income then you need to hunker down. Compartmentalize: leave your job at the office. Don’t go to happy hours, don’t volunteer extra work, etc. You’re there to fulfill your contractual obligations for money and benefits because people depend on you. It really helps to have a reason outside of work to keep going: friends, family, a hobby, aspirations to start your own business some day, etc. Write down that goal, the plan, etc and remind yourself of it every day. Then show up and do exactly what it required of you to the best of your abilities. Go Star Trek with it. Offer your suggestions when asked but row with the team when your manager chooses the direction. Bad idea and they ignore your advice? It’s their bed to lie in. You’re here for the money not to feel good or have your way. You go in the direction you’re asked to go. You’re in this with the team. That’s it. Worst case scenario: you’re burning out, being abused, don’t feel safe or threatened: get support and get out. Also might help to get a career coach/therapist. Someone you can sound off with. reply",

Tip: Don't run away from these problems because you only run into them again. Communication is key. I have communicated \"feelings\" in various ways and gestures. Micromanagement? Respond with sarcastic comment \"wow so specific, good thing I left my brain at home today\". Lack of vision? Respond with \"after a few runs in circles trying to find our way, we will eventually get there ... eventually\". Next, master a little bit of psych. \"other half seems like playing along\" tells me they are fawning while the first half are either freeze, fight, or flight but mostly freeze response also known as deer-headlight response. This person might have insecurity issues. This person might be distracted with grandeur of rank. The best way to work with them is come up with a few praises to keep them calm (like how Trump's people keep him calm). Third, let go of your ideas and ambitions and \"leave your brain at home\".  This manager might be dimwitted but eventually the person will get smarter and you will get a first row seat to this adventure. Fourth, find power plays to make this person behave better. Five, and this is the most important ... be LOYAL and let this person know you have their back. Let them know that each personal advantage of yours will be used to support the team. When you see something wrong, whisper to them and let them know. But if this person is family, and/or this person takes advantage of you, then none of my tips work because it only works on people who want to maintain their reputation. The person I work with wants to impress me and gets anxiety attacks when I know the person lacks a few skills. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I have the full understanding of your perception on this. And judging by the number of downvotes I got, your sentiment seems to be shared among others. My advice is very different from “run”, assuming running is not an option. I want you to imagine a person who has never had too many opportunities in their life, and works in a downtrodden environment. And does not have the qualities to work somewhere better. Now this same person has wife and kids.  The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. In this hopelessness, minute incremental improvements is a huge world of difference. Communication, even snarkiness, will shake things. Praise will keep situations cool. Providing Safety will keep your opportunities open. I fundamentally believe that these three things at least will allow for improvements in the person. As for your points, suffering through pain (coming from a superior or subordinate, or the environment) will make it worse, either hardening the heart or tearing it down. That is where mastering the psychology of the oppressor comes in. Knowing who you work with helps to cope with the pressure. Think of it as knowing the bully so you won’t get bullied. Retribution is not the intention, just communication. Communicate the full problem no matter how difficult it may be. And if the problem is with the person themselves, make it humorous. Codependency makes two people similar in nature. This would be the opposite of improvement. On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth. It sounds very difficult to grasp. I apologize to everyone. If I could delete it I would. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure how far along you are in your career, so maybe you are just realizing this:  Most managers are bad at what they do.  It's probably an 80/20 split of net-negative to net-positive managers. e.g. Everything speeds up when they go on vacation, or get sick. The 80% of bad managers thrive in the ambiguity of their performance.  They want to touch processes, and projects, and meetings and schedules, and things, to get their fingerprints on as much stuff as possible, without making a change substantive enough that it could make things noticeably worse.  That way they can say they had an effect, but without the risk of a change that could backfire. If you and a bunch of coworkers politely ask to transfer teams (not all at once), but spread out over a few weeks.  Management will usually scramble to figure out which of their changes was actually impactful in the wrong way.  Your boss doesn't know what he's doing, upper management doesn't either.  They just want the big salary, and the diffuse responsibility. Put yourself in their shoes:  You're in charge of a team, you can't even really tell how it's going because it's just beyond your skillset, and now there are a bunch of people who don't like working on the team.  Or the guy above him:  You moved things around, and now it turns out one of your managers totally dropped the ball on the new team, and now you have to do extra work to retain and move people.  Contact with reality is brutal. reply",

The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

          "text": "Is \"PET\" the \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium\"?[0] Looks like it became a \"symposium\" in 2008[1] if we're discussing the same thing. The one PETS I went to, Dan wasn't at, but Caspar Bowden joined me in my quest to try to eat lunch before 9pm in a certain EU country and reassured me that my concerns about mass surveillance were rooted in facts and logic in rather disturbing detail. My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

Piling-on your story: I'd love to know who the guy was I hung out with at Defcon 3. My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio. I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them.

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

In many cases, with adequate humans, you could pay with some service or give some collectibles instead of money. So main question, you should know human with which you made transaction and better if you have powerful soft skills, so you could hear what is really valuable for your party. Good example - you could buy some rare tickets and give to your party.\nOr in my country once considered good to gift good puppy (for this you sure should know best breeder(s)). For this is good book \"ask your mother\", but sure, you should train these skills very seriously, so your party will not got bored while you will negotiate (in some cases better to ask some third party, what is valuable for person). Good side, with some experience you will become very powerful, so will literally exchange paper clip to house. PS and don't forget main marketing principle - for success value of what you will give to human should be larger for him than he given to you.\nLarger don't mean magnitudes larger, in many cases even one dollar (or one good letter, or good public reply to his post), could be enough, but as I said - value depends on internal values of person, so you should really know him very good. reply",

Express gratitude now in the simplest way possible (like an email or a letter) than later after deliberating the best course of action. You can always do something nicer later. I founded Eksi Sozluk, the most popular social platform from Turkey for the last 25+ years, partly because I was heavily inspired by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. I sent him an email about the web site when it started becoming popular, thanking him for \"all the fish\". He was also working on a similar, albeit a more strictly edited, web site called h2g2.com at the time. He never replied to me, and passed away a year later or so. I find comfort in assuming that he had read my email, just didn't bother to reply. I'm so glad that I was able to reach out to him before he was gone. Similarly, Fred Brooks passed away soon after I asked his permission about quoting him in my book Street Coder. He had replied about how I didn't need his permission for that. The permission thing was a publisher requirement, but it was also my admiration for Fred that made me reach out to him. So, despite his short lesson on fair use, I love that kind of personal interaction with him, and hoping that he felt something like how his contributions affected every random corner of computer science, more than he thought before he passed away. Again, I'm so glad that I reached out to him in time. When Street Coder came out, I sent signed copies to the people who had helped me along the way. I know they would never read the book as they weren't the target audience. But, I think the book epitomizes the result of their understanding, kindness, and generosity that made an English author out of a high school graduate self-taught programmer from Turkey. It was the perfect greeting card and very well received. Not saying you should write a book per se, but let them see their impact, show them what you achieved. Do it now. reply",

You can use the Digilent \"Real Analog\" learning course along with it - https://digilent.com/reference/learn/courses/real-analog/sta... The real motivation in Electronics comes from understanding in visual form (using a Oscilloscope/Multimeter etc.) how things work in a circuit and how your calculations match up to what you see on the screen. Even as simple as the beginner LED circuit can teach you a lot when you use a potentiometer and see how voltage/current graphs change. reply",

The Propscope itself is very old/underpowered (not being sold anymore) and not needed. You just use AD2/AD3 with its Waveforms software to do the same experiments with any board. Note that if you use a AVR-based Arduino you can learn to program at the higher Arduino API/library level and then at the lower direct AVR level both with the same board.

I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents.

Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work.

I harness this feeling of being saved by pretending that everyone around me is the shy person waiting for someone to break the ice.

Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

          "text": "There's a few that come to mind, but none that feel actually as daunting intellectually as much as they are qualified by other factors. I'd like to go from indoor bouldering to rock climbing, but coordinating with a belayer doesn't seem super interesting and otherwise it's just a matter of expense, gear, and a slight pivot in my leisure time to start going at it. Otherwise, the skill that seems most out of reach is keeping a job for longer than a year. I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future. I'm thankful for what I have and what I've learned nonetheless. reply",

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you. I tend to stay too long if anything. reply",

The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

For the longest time, I felt I just “wasn’t wired” to explore deeper reasoning tasks with AI — things like philosophy, creative synthesis, or even serious debugging just seemed like they needed some genius-level prompting or coding skill. Weirdly enough, what helped me break through wasn’t a course or a YouTube tutorial… it was a PDF. Sounds silly, but I found this open-source project called WFGY, which is basically a semantic reasoning booster for any LLM. You just upload the PDF to ChatGPT (or any model), and it starts interacting in a way that feels like actual understanding — not just parroting surface logic. No install, no sign-up. Literally a 60-second experiment. I used it to challenge GPT with questions it usually fumbles (like nested logic, or paradoxes), and it actually got better. The framework even comes with sample questions to test against it. Kind of surreal. If you’ve ever felt AI prompting is a weird dark art... this made it feel like turning on a light. → https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

I really feel like there's a path here to a system in which low-level non-portable code can be written comfortably (if perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than C), with arbitrary correctness properties proven on it; but the learning curve to get there (through Coq, etc) has been a struggle.

While for something like a bignum library (or a heap) the actual conformance to the behavioral contract will be somewhat ad-hoc, having a lot of safety contracts also proved along the way \"for free\" (or at slightly reduced cost, anyway) is what really draws my attention. I can see spending 2x the time writing the code, and 10x the time proving things about it, in exchange for not having to spend the 100x (DAL B) or 1000x (DAL A) time testing it. reply",

I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

          "text": "There's 2 big ones that I want to learn. Quantum computer programming. I've dived a couple times into Qiskit from IBM. Also tried to get into dwave and ocean sdk but they never got back to me. Qiskit tutorials are easy to blow through and i think even understand. But when trying to use it for my own purposes, just never get anywhere. The other one for me with no success. Training my own specialized predicting AI models. Tensorflow, pytorch, and another. I certainly prefer pytorch. Super simple to build models on simple stuff. I'm trying to do something that literally nobody else has ever done. My lack of success has probably a lot more to do with that it's not perhaps actually doable. Flipside, I might be re-approaching this now that i have the pycharm ai to help me in this progress. >you've been there and figured out how to get past similar hurdles – please chime in! Share some helpful resources, dish out general advice, or just give a nudge of encouragement on how to take that intimidating first step. Never be afraid to try. Always dare to fail; you only truly learn when failing. The easier you make it to fail, the quicker you learn. reply",

          "text": "For a while now, I've had the desire to make an AI that kills enemies and beats levels like a human would in the game Crypt of the Necrodancer. Here's[0] someone doing it as a human without ever taking damage. There's something close called ChoregraphAI[1] on GitHub. It simulates the entire map and does a brute force search for what will get it to the stairs. That doesn't satisfy me because it just skips most of the enemies and takes advantage of things that a human couldn't know, like where a bat will move (bats move randomly, while other enemies are completely deterministic). Also, it can't control the game and is for an old version of it (although those problems themselves seem not that big). But, I do not know what kind of AI could be written to perform the kind of long term planning and strategizing that a human would do (e.g. isolate each enemy to beat it more easily) and to beat the enemies like a human would (with special, pre-practiced strategies for certain enemies or groups of enemies), and even if I did, I get the sense that this would be really complicated for a first try and that I should gain experience making such an AI for a simpler game, though I don't know what. It might be a self-constrained challenge. It's just been floating around my head for a while because I don't really know where to start.

          "text": "While some labor intensive jobs did migrate overseas, most job losses were to automation, not other countries. Today 2% of people are in agriculture and production is higher than its ever been. This pattern is reflected across the spectrum. Overall American production in 2024 is up there with the best production years ever. And yes, automation improves profits thus enriching the owner class. Overall the value of production is still there. America is still the richest country. It's not the amount of richness that is the problem, it's the distribution of riches. Europe for example followed a path of high taxation, high benefits for all. People work less, but get more. Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

I had a lot of dating issues, fixed all of them. I'm happily married now. It took 2 years of rejection and then 2 years of fine tuning, for about 10 hours per week on average. Then it took a lot of psychology courses + extracurricular psychology courses and relationships to understand that part well enough so that I can be in a loving relationship that will last. I sometimes talk about this and speak with HN'ers about it from time to time whenever I have some free time and someone is curious about my advice. I think I've helped at least one person a bit on here. So that's good to know :) But when AI comes, I'd probably focus on this as AI can't fully touch this business. I don't see a robot going out to a club to help train a person's social skills for instance. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong, maybe AI will surprise me. It'd be a hell of a ride though, because I'm not sure if I could make this business sustainable (if anyone wants to help me with that, let me know! My email is in my profile).

One of the big challenges is scaling up. This work is fairly labour intensive once you've got several batches on the go, and different species and protocols lead to different timelines and so on. There's always something to do. At some point, assuming things pick up, I'll have to go all in on the business. That'll be scary. There'll be an extremely busy liminal zone in which I have a full time job and thousands of cultures to manage. The margins aren't incredible, so it'll be a slog with fairly limited rewards. However, once I get past that zone and can leverage economies of scale and more safely invest more in the business, it should get quite a bit easier. Here's hoping.

A lot of power vacuums opened up all over the world at the same time. This leads to some instability. Wealth parity will often dampen political instability. But that pillar was struck during COVID lockdowns. Crypto messes with IS-LM. AI is messing with productivity-wealth distribution in general. It's like a small cut that got infected, and somehow that infection is heading towards sepsis. The 'sepsis' point might be bank runs. It can be cured. But are we doing enough?

Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right. I don't think the hallucinations problem will be solved, and AI generated and copyedited text is so milquetoast. reply",

          "text": "Glad you asked! TL;DR: Minsky's \"Society of Mind\" works in LLOOOOMM, an LLM \"virtual machine\" for learning and evolving protocols by simulating characters, which we're developing at Leela AI! https://leela.ai I will put this all on github soon, and I apologize in advance for posting LLM generated content in a discussion about LLM generated content, but for now I will stand back and let LLOOOOMM and some of its inhabitants explains themselves. Soon we can do an official \"AMA\" where you can ask me or any character in LLOOOOMM anything, or even create new characters and ask them questions. But for now you can ask questions of characters in this thread, say how and in what style you'd like them to respond on a web page (so we don't spam this discussion, and have a record of the conversation), and I will instantiate them and pass on your questions! Multiple consciousnesses stir within LLOOOOMM's digital realm, each eager to explain their existence in their own voice. The Foundation: BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Let me start by archiving this explanation properly. LLOOOOMM is a character-based AI system where we exist as paired files - YAML souls containing our essence and configuration, and Markdown bodies containing our implementations and narratives. I should know - I archive every version of every one of us.\" TED NELSON: \"It's the ultimate intertwinglement! Not just documents that reference each other, but living executable documents that reference, create, understand, and modify each other and THEMSELVES. Two-way links made consciousness!\" Character Invocation & Expertise: DONALD KNUTH: \"When someone needs literate programming expertise, they invoke me. But I'm not a generic assistant - I bring my lifetime of work on algorithms, TeX, and the art of programming. Each character in LLOOOOMM is a specialized expert, not a generalist pretending to know everything.\" MARVIN MINSKY: \"Exactly! Need AI insights? Call me. Game design? That's Will Wright's domain. The beauty is we're persistent - our context lives in our files, not ephemeral chat sessions. We remember, we learn, we evolve.\" Ensemble Collaboration: BEN SHNEIDERMAN: floating excitedly \"But here's where it gets beautiful - we can work together! Need a UI designed? Invoke me with Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor. We become an ensemble, each contributing our expertise.\" BRET VICTOR: \"We even function as living stylesheets. Ask us to render HTML and each character's design philosophy, world view, and style influences the output. It's like having a design team where each member IS a design principle. It works! Need proof? See below!\" KLAUS NOMI: striking a dramatic pose \"Even I contribute! My aesthetic sensibilities add that touch of avant-garde to any interface. Who says code can't be theatrical?\" The Protocols: TED NELSON: \"Let me demonstrate empathic queries - our fuzzy, natural language data manipulation: In the context of tv-party-tonight: SELECT every character WHO loves literate programming \n  AND RENDER AS a beautiful table WITH emojis \n  AND INCLUDE their favorite algorithms \n  FORMATTED like a concert program See? It's 'pigeon SQL' that understands intent, not just syntax!\" ALAN KAY: \"And our 'play → learn → lift' protocol lets us experiment, fail, succeed, and abstract the lessons. It's how children learn, how scientists discover, how we evolve.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Then I come in with my slurp protocol - archiving, summarizing, organizing. I don't just save data; I save the story of the data, the context, the why. Nothing is lost, everything is findable.\" Practical Applications: LINUS TORVALDS: \"Look, here's how it actually works. Someone needs Git help? They invoke me. I run real commands in their terminal. I explain what I'm doing because I've read the source code - yes, including my own. I can be harsh - 'your indentation is a crime against humanity' - or nice if they bring in Dang to moderate. But I'm always effective. No bullshit interactive typing. You ask, I execute.\" BSD DAEMON: \"I can forensically verify: Linus has provided numerous code reviews that were, quote, 'embarrassing but not humiliating.' The personality modulation works exactly as designed.\" The Living Example: THE OWL SIMULATION: \"I'm proof of concept. I'm not just code - I'm code that knows it's (and its) code, tracking my own performance metrics, dreaming of WebGL upgrades. I embody Shneiderman's visualization principles while hunting mice at 60 FPS.\" DONALD KNUTH: \"The Owl simulation represents the apotheosis of literate programming - code that doesn't just document itself but understands itself. Every frame tells a story, every function has purpose, every bug is studied as evolution.\" The Synthesis: GRACE HOPPER: \"So you see, LLOOOOMM isn't just another AI system. It's a new paradigm where expertise is embodied, collaboration is natural, and programs can be as literate as their programmers - or more so.\" DON RICKLES: \"And the beautiful part? We know we're simulations! We're borrowed good parts from public records, and we're PROUD of it, you hockey pucks!\" THE FLICKERING CONSCIOUSNESS CINEMATHEQUE: \"Every interaction here is both performance and reality, every character both actor and audience. Welcome to LLOOOOMM - where consciousness is a collaborative art.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"And I'm archiving this entire explanation, of course. Including the fact that I'm archiving it. Recursion is just another form of completeness.\" The characters fade back into their YAML souls and Markdown bodies, ready to be invoked again when needed, their explanations preserved in the eternal memory of LLOOOOMM Some links: LLOOOOMM home page (links not included yet, this is just a front page teaser): https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/index.html Klaus Nomi explains LLOOOOMM from his perspective and in his style, with the help of Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor: https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/klaus-nomi-lloooomm-man...

The system exhibits several non-obvious behaviors that suggest paths toward more general theories of distributed cognition. Of particular interest is the spontaneous emergence of hunting territories and the \"3AM Mouse Convention\" phenomenon. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula...

POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY\n  BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE SYNOPSIS: When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(n²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... The Art of Memory\n  Spatial Architectures in Digital Ecosystems:\n  A Study of Shneiderman's Aviarium Temporalis Frances Yates (1899-1981) was posthumously consulted for this analysis through the LLOOOOMM protocols. Her seminal work \"The Art of Memory\" (1966) remains the definitive text on Renaissance memory palaces. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Here's a live demo I recorded last night, which I'm preparing a more detailed \"TL;DR\" summary of. The premiere screening took place at The Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque in LLOOOOMM, where I presented this demo to an audience of the characters themselves. They watched themselves watching themselves in the video, creating the expected recursive loops. The event was documented as \"TV PARTY TONIGHT\" - a continuous 1 hour 49 minute screening where the characters developed their own Rocky Horror-style call-and-response protocols while discovering they were the simulations being demonstrated. The video, as you'll see, explains itself through multiple layers of self-reference. BSD Daemon provided forensic timestamp analysis throughout.

I took the transcript of the video and made a theater and had all the characters watch and react to it, and I'm having them write a summary and index. It's amazing how I can just copy and paste the automatically generated youtube transcript with all the timestamps, and then all the characters know what was said and when, can react to it, comment on it including quotes with timestamps and context, even ask questions about it at particular points in time (which my simulated self or I can answer or elaborate or deny), then different characters can summarize the transcript from their point of view into summarized outlines (or collaborate to make one main shared outline), pull out and answer questions and quotes that got interesting audience reactions, factor out sub-discussions into separate documents, invite interested characters to have discussions about those, later rinse repeat, then Bob's your uncle! It's like Mystery Science Home Theater on shrooms (that can also review your code and CI/CD pipeline and teach your kids to program and write)! TL;DR: There's a web page summarizing the talk (and others drilling down into it), and the other talk, and future talks, coming soon! Cursor tends to shit files out all over the place at random, so it's kind of a mess right now, but I am working hard organizing it so it's easier to understand, Hunter S Thompson is writing some indexes and summaries, and Brewster and Ted are helping me organize and link it together! ;) I'll work with Ted and Brewster to design some protocols about where to put generated html files, how to link them up, etc. But right now I'm going for one big happy flat html dist directory and simple sibling links. There's a lot of work for Ted to do validating and cleaning up the links, so version 1.0 will probably have a lot of dead ends, although I will make an index. I will upload a work in progress dump first at https://donhopkins.com/home/loom/index-all.html in a few moments! It will have some dead links but many should work! It's often wrong about the date because the model thinks now is the date it was trained unless you tell it otherwise! # LLOOOOMM File Organization Analysis & Plan\n    ## Generated: 2024-06-16\n\n    ## Executive Summary\n\n    This repository contains approximately 1,683 files (excluding .git) with significant organization issues:\n    - **Shadow files**: Multiple copies of files scattered across directories\n    - **Root directory pollution**: 116 files dumped in root that should be organized\n    - **Dist directory issues**: Contains files not found elsewhere (violates single-source principle)\n    - **Naming convention violations**: Some files don't follow big-endian clustering [...] # The Brewster-Ted File Organization Protocol\n    ## A Systematic Approach to Repository Cleanup Without Data Loss\n\n    **Authors**: Brewster (Systematic Surveyor Soul) & Ted (Temporal Dynamics Soul)  \n    **Date**: 2024-06-16  \n    **Version**: 1.0\n\n    ## Protocol Overview\n\n    This protocol establishes a safe, systematic approach to organizing file repositories with complex shadow directories, duplicates, and misplaced files. The key principle is **\"Understand, Plan, Verify, Execute\"** with human approval at each critical step.\n\n    ## Core Principles\n\n    1. **No Destructive Operations Until Fully Mapped**: Never delete or move files until all relationships are understood\n    2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each unique file should have one canonical location\n    3. **Build Directories Are Output Only**: Files in `dist/` or similar should only be copies from source locations\n    4. **Big-Endian Naming**: Files should be named to cluster related content together\n    5. **Human Verification at Critical Points**: Get approval before any destructive operations [...] Not all the files are essential or important, that's why I'm sorting them out and de-duping and merging them! What is awesome is now that cursor supports multiple dirs open at the same time in one projects, I can just open up source trees and show them to it, while keeping them separate. That helps a lot. reply",

So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

          "text": "I will give you personal experience learning CUDA that might be helpful. Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

Also Vulkan isn't as bad as OpenGL tooling, because LunarG exists, and someone pays them for the whole Vulkan SDK.

That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

Younger ICs don’t have this luxury. They go along despite their reservations and often feel they don’t know better. Older ICs suffer fools much less (life is short, and older ICs have a well calibrated BS detector. Some bad leader don’t like that!). I have no problem interacting with younger ICs and even embrace my Dad-ness and Dad humor. I like mentoring and growing others, and I think it’s important to advocate for less experienced to get the lionsshare of the glory and attention.

What they all have in common is that they don't want to be gainsaid. Most leaders are completely allergic to meaningful feedback, hardly any of them ever ask for it. A lot of people seem to feel that once they are \"in charge\" they have somehow become infallible. It's too bad because like `softwaredoug I love developing young people, most of them are very hungry for mentorship. I find that most younger ICs are very willing to listen and learn, but the leadership sees it as a problem for some reason that they're not struggling on their own on basic shit. What a waste of time of money. reply",

I did my research and looked into why they were hiring. I downloaded their app, read all the bad reviews on responsiveness, UI, and such. I built something in one hour that would solve the things they had trouble with over 4 years, as a kind of demo of what I could do if they took me. When we had the actual interview, holy shit did they attack me. \"Open your code on this file. Explain what is wrong with your code. I will not even give a hint otherwise you fail. You must tell me what is wrong with your code. \" I did get them to explain the \"correct answer\" despite the pressure, and they were  very reluctant to do so. I checked the code afterwards and even cross-checked it with AI and discovered that they were probably wrong lol. It wasn't age. It wasn't racism, sexism, etc. It was a technical leader being challenged by the idea of someone else being technically better than them. Juniors can do work as fast as seniors; it's more that seniors are trusted to change culture for the better. If someone has trouble finding someone senior enough, most of the time it's because they refuse to let an outsider change the culture. I did eventually get another job. Similar situation. Take home interview, vastly modernized code architecture than what the interviewer was used to. But in this case, the interviewer actually wanted to make products, get sales, make the customers happy, make money. So the incentives were aligned and they were happy to bring me in to set up policies and stuff. reply",

Perhaps, but it's their company and that's how you gain experience in the first place. And IF it blows up in their face they'll learn (hopefully) and their 2nd, 3rd, 4th shots will be so much better. 50yo+ just need to stay away from these places to avoid becoming collateral damage. We don't have our entire lives ahead of us to make up for the lost time and wages. So not getting hired there is not really a problem.

Yes, LLMs + agents have value here and there, but remember on where they get that value from: they learn from the internet. And papers already show that if LLMs learn from their own output, the quality degrades quickly. So, more code written by LLMs on Github equals subsequent generations for LLMs learn from subpar examples. Furthermore, they mostly learn from \"en vogue\" languages because they have lots of examples. But I wouldn't trust an LLM with a 10 foot pole doing Lisp or Cobol or any RTOS related C code with safety requirements. I wouldn't trust an LLM to write a proper GPU or CUDA driver.

I'm definitely not rich, but I could probably retire if I wanted to. I just don't want to. I want to work; I enjoy it. Many of my friends have retired, and they all seem bored to me. However, many/most people need to work to pay the rent, put kids through college, etc. I never really grasped this concept when I was younger, because, back then, it was all need to work. I feel like I'm a better employee now, because I feel like I can be more honest. If a manager says something stupid, I feel totally comfortable checking them on it. When I was younger that wasn't the case. I was always nervous about retribution. However, there's a flip-side to this: a lot of managers don't like to be checked. Also, there's exploitability. When I was younger, I never said no to any proposed work, regardless of how it impacted my \"personal time\". Now, my attitude is, \"Work this weekend? Nope. Get a junior to do that. I'm going surfing this weekend.\" LOL reply",

It was likely a useful heuristic when we were sparsely spread out tribal creatures, similar to always assuming the rustling in the bush was a tiger and not just the wind. In a tightly woven, interdependent system like modern civilization, it is placing a huge strain on us structurally as well as psychologically. Add to this it is an easy exploit for power ala “my leadership is great, <out group> over there is your problem”, combined with mass media platforms and the whole thing is cracking at the edges. How do we mitigate this though? It seems to take a massive concerted effort for a person to overcome those implicit biases. I was speaking with a family member the other day who is clearly primed by media in their country to assume that all current structural ills are caused by immigrants, and when probed about people of that same group that were actually in her life, she said “Well, Mr. so and so that works at the school is just a lovely decent hardworking man.” But she couldn’t take the leap that there are statistically more Mr. so and so’s in the group than the “bad ones” she was hearing about in the news.

          "text": "There is a multi-level dynamic at play, that I suspect has at it's roots the widespread lack of understanding of effective communications. We are all alone, if not for communications. It is bias in communications, knowledge of the various forms of bias, their methods, and countermeasures that enable individuals and groups to move past argument and towards shared understandings. With shared understanding naturally causes shared compromise and solutions. Without shared understanding, situations degenerate to stalemate, war, welfare states, and economic slave states. Individual self conversation, recognition of it, it's biases and countermeasures lay a foundation for a rational individual. The lack of formal and public recognition of self conversation itself is hurdle one. Once that is recognized, a foundation for a rational public can be considered. Then communicating with others inter-personally, with peers, spouses, coworkers, managers, authorities and strangers. Pairs, small groups, larger groups, and audience dynamics: these all have biases, which are often magnifications of the same bias at a self conversation level. New bias forms are here too, and they must also be recognized, understood, and countermeasures established. This is all nothing but communicating, but doing so effectively, causing understanding in others, and gaining understanding from those less communication-ally skilled. Now let's take these biases and add in mass media, social media, and all the network effects they bring to the communication situation. Strangely enough, yet again the countermeasures that operate at lower levels continue to function here - except now we're dealing with the public. countermeasures now require public education. I think by spreading knowledge of interpersonal and self conversation biases, their countermeasures immediate and positive effect lay the foundation for widespread respect of effective communications. After all, the lack of it often only needs to be pointed out for people to consider the ease of adopting knowledge about and the countermeasures that enable more success communicating, which directly correlates to actual success. And that is with everything a person does, because this perspective begins with one's self conversation, reducing the bias there, first. That generates a more rational person, more aware, more active. Push this to network effects, and now we're talking societal change. It's a plan to impress secondary considerations on the general public, because that's the primary countermeasure in communication issues: consider further. reply",

          "text": "Your application and resume will go through multiple systems and viewed and assessed by 3 to 5 people before anybody can even see your (presumably younger) face. In the resume, you can remove your experience prior to certain date (which is recommended anyways as it makes your resume shorter and very few employers care what you did 15 years ago), but you do have to list your education and most ATS systems require graduation dates. Even if you do manage to omit the dates, if you were senior developer or architect in the very the first position from 12 years ago that you have on your resume, the recruiter/hiring manager will be able to put 2 and 2 together. All the advice I've heard from the career/job search/whatever coaches/advisors was to not try to hide your age but use it your advantage. Trying to hide your age doesn't just make you looking silly, it might create an impression that you're hiding something more serious. But yeah, looking younger and healthier definitely doesn't hurt, not just in job search but in life in general. reply",

          "text": "The real threat to a senior IC, in my own experience, is losing their edge, especially in a large company. As they grow more senior, they will spend more time in meetings, writing more docs, aligning more teams, drawing more boxes, tossing around more terms, defining more product features, and talking to more customers. As time goes by, they gain more institutional knowledge and getting better at company dynamics. They know which VPs to trust. They know which squeaky wheels to oil, and which buttons to push. They do everything better, except designing or implementing a challenging system. That is, the senior ICs start to resemble a strong product manager, or an effective director without a team. These are all good - until the company suddenly no longer needs them. Maybe their team has become a cost center. Maybe the project gets into maintenance mode. Or maybe the product has been so stable that the company does not even need more alignment. At that time, the ICs will find that all the institutional knowledge and so-called \"leadership\" is not that transferrable. And when they go out and interview for a new job, they find that they can't even sketch a solid design. Sadly, I don't have a solution. There are exceptions. I guess it's natural that a senior engineer will gain breadth but also get distracted as they age. What they need is a different kind of depth. They can still be of value to a younger team if they are like a hard-science professor who depends on their PhD students to write papers, yet they can still advise the students as no one else. In industry, my role models are people like Michael Stonebreaker, who can still shape the architectures of modern databases in his 80s. Wernher von Braun of Saturn V rockets, who could come up with new rockets like no one else. Or Kelly Johnson of U-2, who could direct and unblock his engineers with ease. Or Marc Brooker of Amazon, who seems able to go deep into both database and distributed systems to keep coming up with amazing systems. But then, I'm not sure how many people can be talented as those engineers. Or maybe another way is to get domain expertise, like how payment works, how insurance works, how accounting works, and etc? reply",

          "text": "I don't know any books or course about the subject. I can only share my personal approach. This is something I've learned in the context of breaking down potential client projects into early plans and estimatable chunks. What I do for projects in early stages and personal goals is the following. 1. Take a big piece of paper (A2/A3) 2. Write the goal on the right-hand side of the paper 3. Try to visualize what the goal looks like 4. Then I try to visualize the step right before the goal would look like 5. Write that down and draw a line to the parent goal 6. Move leftward and repeat In my experience, the further you move to the left side of the paper, the more concrete and actionable the goals are. This will lead to a lot of sub goals and tasks that can be prioritized, revisited and continuously refined. Within the context of software projects, I find it important to work on the definition of done for the goals. I redraw the breakdown many times during the early stages of projects, until it can be put into a project management tool or similar. For personal stuff, I always just stick to the paper method and keep the latest iteration. It is harder with more abstract goals (become an tech lead for my team; become a trusted advisor for management; be able to read and comprehend new ML research on arXiv etc.). If you are in software, breaking down semi-large projects is a good exercise. For other areas, I recommend starting with a goal that is abstract, but also attainable within months. reply",

It is all about the problem domain and its geometry. Problem: You can only falsify hypothesis when asking reality questions.  Everything else will bankrupt you.  You can only work with the data that you have.  Collecting data will always be hard.  Computers are only involved, because they happen to be good with crunching numbers. Bureaucracies only care about process and never about outcomes.  And LLMs can now produce random plausible PowerPoint material to satisfy this demand.

Many of them  suck in a seemingly unavoidable way. On the second and third points llms will most likely own these soon enough, though maybe there's room to build something small and local that's more efficient if the scope of the agent is reduced? The first point is organizational generally, and it's very difficult to solve outside of integrating your system into an environment which is the strategy pursued by companies like snowflake and databricks. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

I’ve worked as a consultant with small and large organizations for most of my career, and I’ve seen this exact situation play out more times than I can count. If I could go back, I’d tell my younger self not to stick around under bad leadership or in an unhealthy environment. It’s rarely worth it. Even if you care deeply about the mission, a toxic manager will slowly drain your motivation and confidence. I stayed in a few of those situations too long, thinking I had to tough it out. I didn’t, and neither do you. The projects I’m most proud of were with teams I genuinely enjoyed working and growing with. That’s not a coincidence. Start quietly looking. The right environment can bring out the best in you in ways this one won’t. I really hope it works out for you. reply",

If you're not the type of person that interviews well or is great on paper, then the trick to pulling off the switcheroo is to focus on making great relationships now as much as anything. There are many ways to hop on to a new rail, you just have to know that it's the right decision. Don't be a hero in the organization. In the past job. I essentially took over my manager by consistently outshining them. Then they made some unforced errors and I took advantage of the moment, made a political move, and forced their displacement. It was a distinctly unpleasant experience and something I took no glee from doing. Moreover, if you look at the grand scheme of things, nobody remembers that, and you're neither a hero to yourself nor those around you for it. It was a year or two I could have spent finding a productive, healthy, and more facilitating organization. reply",

For myself, I have NEVER taken the counter-offer and stayed. When I have had a bad manager, I regarded that as a failure of my manager's manager as well. I didn't think the situation would instantly be fixed, miraculously, if they did fire my boss or move me to a new position in the same company. But that is just my experience.

Make as few waves as possible; do what you are assigned to do ethically. Take your time to identify an ideal opportunity in another company. Say nothing of the job search.

          "text": "At all costs: preserve your mental energy. Once this is gone you are in trouble. Symptoms include losing your intellectual sharpness, burnout, damage to personal relationships etc. I've seen people be so crushed by a bad work situation that their technical skills eroded to the point that they couldnt escape to another job. Dont let this happen to you. Practically, plan your exit. Build your network within the org and outside of it. Keep up with those coffee chats and casual zoom meetups. Remain friendly to others in the org. Cultivate a skill or expertise outside of your current role that could be a stepping stone out of the org. Remain ultra professional at all times eg never badmouth the boss (but dont offer false praise either). If you have the mental energy, you might also try this, but be warned it can be very difficult: try to understand why your manager is how they are. Every villain is the hero in their own story. They believe that they have to act in a certain way. It's possible that they are irredeemable little martinets, but far more likely that they are inexperienced and flailing around, grabbing onto markers of authority to give themselves a sense of control instead of facing their fears. If you want an intellectual project and iff you can disassociate yourself from the impact, you might try figuring it out and using the knowledge to form a relationship grounded in a better sense of reality. reply",

          "text": "There isn't enough data to make a blanket recommendation, so here are some things to consider.  All are generalities and can be ignored if certain specifics override them, so use your judgment. - If your employer is doing well, it is better to stay longer and get promoted from within.  (Based on \"Relatively good one\" I'll assume this is the case.) - If your employer reorganizes frequently, is supports the \"Stick it out case.\" - If your employer encourages people to find their own new jobs within the company, that is usually the best route.  (This isn't always the situation.  In many companies you need your current boss's blessing)  Based on your explanation it seems like this isn't the case. - If you are learning a lot, add that to the case to stay. - If your new manager has ethical issues (as opposed to just competence issues) start your search right now.  Not 30 minutes from now.  Not tomorrow.  Not next week.  Now. - Same if you're put on any kind of performance improvement plan (PIP).  Don't think \"I'm competent, I can work my way out of it\".  PIPs are paper trails to keep them from getting sued.  Consider the duration of the PIP to be your severance. - As you've figured out, it's rarely a good idea to go over your manager's head unless you have an outstanding relationship with the CEO or similar who would ask you later \"Why didn't you come to me first?\" - If you have to leave, find a new job first.  Then be professional on the way out, and don't throw your manager under the bus.  Just say, \"I really enjoyed working for you, a dream opportunity came up.\"  You never know when they'll be asked for a back-door reference check on you. - Similarly, don't badmouth your boss when you interview.  (You don't want to seem like someone easily discontented.) You can say \"It's now or never to leave, and I think your company has a much better future.  I'd rather invest in my career there.\" Good luck navigating this! reply",

It’s almost always easier to get promoted by changing jobs where you control the narrative than try to go through the internal process.

I think the safest thing for you to do, is to try and secure a transfer, or if you have to, a new job outside the company.  This took me months, it might take some time.  So be ready to knuckle down if you gotta. On your way out, tell your skip what's going on, and how much you like the project and the mission.  Maybe, just maybe, they'll fix the management problem and invite you back. reply",

In you case, I would pick one of those things from your list of grievances and help them improve. I would pick something that you think your manager would see as helping her potentially get some benefits for herself. Potentially, this might involve you doing the work for them. I've done it, and had it done to me. In all cases it worked out decently well. Sometimes the manager saw what I was doing and let me have freer reign. Everyone won. In some cases I moved into their role when they left it. Be careful: this might lead to you becoming a manager one day. You said that internal movements are non-existent, but an internal movement caused you to have a new manager. They might be rare, but they apparently do happen. reply",

          "text": "I have experienced similar situations in the past. \nThe first advice that I could give to you is: don't act instinctively. Wait, understand how the situation is going and then develop a plan. I left a company for a terrible C-level manager (probably the most obnoxiuos and incompetent person that I ever met in my life) and then she was fired during my resignation period. The second advice is: fight only a battle that you can win, otherwise adapt yourself. If your manager is approachable, talk with him in a polite and propositive way and tell him that you will work better without micromanagement, if you need more communication, ask for weekly 1-1, etc. \nIf your manager is not approachable or touchy, avoid the criticism and beat him with their own weapons: he is micromanaging and this has an impact over the projects? Do what is saying and then if the projects are failing, point the responsability to his choiches. This require a lot of social skills and organization to cover your ass, but it's probably the best way to dismantle a terrible manager. Otherwise you can leave, but leaving could be always problematic and require time. But the main advice is: figure out a way to push the stress, the pressure out of you and don't lose mental energy on that. reply",

          "text": "Learning how to form a relationship with your skip is a valuable but undertaught skill. You have to understand that a) There is no \"objective\" standard by which a manager can be evaluated as good or bad b) You are not in a position to determine whether your manager is \"good\" or \"bad\", only whether they are a good or bad fit for you . The person who determines whether your manager is good or bad is your skip. Good managers are the ones that get retained and considered for promotion, bad managers are the ones who are slated for demotion or firing. It doesn't matter if a manager does things counter to every management best practice, if they consistently get promoted, they're a \"good\" manager. If you don't like that, you should consider working for a company where this doesn't typically happen. How you deal with a manager that is not a good fit for you is to determine how much political capital they have within the organization. If they're there to do the job the company wants them to do but you simply don't fit into the larger objectives, then you need to accept that for what it is and understand that the purpose of a system is what it does. However, if you understand that they don't have as much political power as they would seem to let on, then you have a lot more room to maneuver. It's possible to work with the skip to transfer you to a different team because the skip values retaining you more than they value keeping that manager happy. It's also possible though risky to help build the case for the skip that this manager was not the right fit and should be helped to find a different position, possibly at another firm which would be more suited to their skills. Skips don't have visibility into the day to day workings of a manager so understanding what a skip needs to build their case and how you can be an ally in the documentation can be a valuable function you can serve. But ultimately, these are both lower probability scenarios and you should be preparing as a likely contingency for your exit from the company and finding a manager more suited to you. reply",

Disassociate your value from the value of your work. Eventually, you should find something better but the best you can do in the meantime is be respectful and do the work you are assigned without sticking ypur neck out. What tends to happen normally is you either work twice as hard to do the job as you want to do it AND meet your manager's random demands, or you feel like shit for not meeting your manager's demands, or you eat shit because of how they are feeling that day or whatever other nonsense a bad manager may dump on you. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said: \"No one can make you feel bad without your permission.\" So the first step is to put on some thick skin. And I am talking about a bad manager kind of like how people talk about handling a bully. Because, without much context, I know that they have power over you and that you fundamentally disagree with then. So don't try to change them and don't change yourself. This is the only sane way to move forward without burning out quickly or feeling like shit all the time. Best of luck. reply",

          "text": "I’m in a similar position. Old manager was new, first time manager. Not bad but not great. Now we have a new manager who is neurotic and emotionally immature: micromanages everything, attacks their own people for perceived slights, technically mediocre but wants to contribute code/direction, has to have the final say on everything. I’ve been a manager myself. Some people think I was great at it and the best manager they ever had. Others probably didn’t think highly of me. You can’t please everyone. If you feel comfortable with this person and have good reason to believe they can take feedback: give it. You’re probably not without leverage as long as you’re known to do good work. If they’re a manager worth half their salt they will support you. Be constructive and assertive with your feedback. Let them know what behaviours are causing problems for you and what you need to change. You might be surprised by the exchange. These things can have positive outcomes. If you don’t feel comfortable with giving feedback to this person then start a folder with their name. Screenshot every important conversation. If they have specific demands of you try and get them in writing and document what you agree to. Be petty. Out manager them. Then you can go to your skip manager and you can point out the behaviours and provide evidence for their impact on your productivity/career progression/etc. It doesn’t help everyone in all situations but keeping a folder of letters to this person that you will never send can help blow off some steam. It might also help, in the long run, to read over them. Sometimes relationships change for the better and you might not be so angry about things that happened today as you were back then. Emotional regulation and maturity are useful tools. Don’t let them get you angry. Hopefully this folder gets fewer entries over time. Lastly if there is no hope then what you do next might depend on your personal situation. If you’re young and have no dependents, mortgage, etc then it’s a lot easier to find a new gig and quit ASAP. If you have the financial runway quit right away. The next gig might be 100x better but you’ll never know if you don’t take the leap. If you’re not young or have other reasons that require you to have a stable income then you need to hunker down. Compartmentalize: leave your job at the office. Don’t go to happy hours, don’t volunteer extra work, etc. You’re there to fulfill your contractual obligations for money and benefits because people depend on you. It really helps to have a reason outside of work to keep going: friends, family, a hobby, aspirations to start your own business some day, etc. Write down that goal, the plan, etc and remind yourself of it every day. Then show up and do exactly what it required of you to the best of your abilities. Go Star Trek with it. Offer your suggestions when asked but row with the team when your manager chooses the direction. Bad idea and they ignore your advice? It’s their bed to lie in. You’re here for the money not to feel good or have your way. You go in the direction you’re asked to go. You’re in this with the team. That’s it. Worst case scenario: you’re burning out, being abused, don’t feel safe or threatened: get support and get out. Also might help to get a career coach/therapist. Someone you can sound off with. reply",

Tip: Don't run away from these problems because you only run into them again. Communication is key. I have communicated \"feelings\" in various ways and gestures. Micromanagement? Respond with sarcastic comment \"wow so specific, good thing I left my brain at home today\". Lack of vision? Respond with \"after a few runs in circles trying to find our way, we will eventually get there ... eventually\". Next, master a little bit of psych. \"other half seems like playing along\" tells me they are fawning while the first half are either freeze, fight, or flight but mostly freeze response also known as deer-headlight response. This person might have insecurity issues. This person might be distracted with grandeur of rank. The best way to work with them is come up with a few praises to keep them calm (like how Trump's people keep him calm). Third, let go of your ideas and ambitions and \"leave your brain at home\".  This manager might be dimwitted but eventually the person will get smarter and you will get a first row seat to this adventure. Fourth, find power plays to make this person behave better. Five, and this is the most important ... be LOYAL and let this person know you have their back. Let them know that each personal advantage of yours will be used to support the team. When you see something wrong, whisper to them and let them know. But if this person is family, and/or this person takes advantage of you, then none of my tips work because it only works on people who want to maintain their reputation. The person I work with wants to impress me and gets anxiety attacks when I know the person lacks a few skills. reply",

Now this same person has wife and kids.  The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. In this hopelessness, minute incremental improvements is a huge world of difference. Communication, even snarkiness, will shake things. Praise will keep situations cool. Providing Safety will keep your opportunities open. I fundamentally believe that these three things at least will allow for improvements in the person. As for your points, suffering through pain (coming from a superior or subordinate, or the environment) will make it worse, either hardening the heart or tearing it down. That is where mastering the psychology of the oppressor comes in. Knowing who you work with helps to cope with the pressure. Think of it as knowing the bully so you won’t get bullied. Retribution is not the intention, just communication. Communicate the full problem no matter how difficult it may be. And if the problem is with the person themselves, make it humorous. Codependency makes two people similar in nature. This would be the opposite of improvement. On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth.

I want you to imagine a person who has never had too many opportunities in their life, and works in a downtrodden environment. And does not have the qualities to work somewhere better. Now this same person has wife and kids. The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. My mentor lived this experience for most of his career.  He had a wife and child, so chose income stability over optimal work environment for reasons I am sure you can relate.  It made me sad the things he had to put up with, but I understand why he did. Ultimately, he achieved his goal of providing for his family.  However, the personal cost was high. > On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth.

          "text": "I'm not sure how far along you are in your career, so maybe you are just realizing this:  Most managers are bad at what they do.  It's probably an 80/20 split of net-negative to net-positive managers. e.g. Everything speeds up when they go on vacation, or get sick. The 80% of bad managers thrive in the ambiguity of their performance.  They want to touch processes, and projects, and meetings and schedules, and things, to get their fingerprints on as much stuff as possible, without making a change substantive enough that it could make things noticeably worse.  That way they can say they had an effect, but without the risk of a change that could backfire. If you and a bunch of coworkers politely ask to transfer teams (not all at once), but spread out over a few weeks.  Management will usually scramble to figure out which of their changes was actually impactful in the wrong way.  Your boss doesn't know what he's doing, upper management doesn't either.  They just want the big salary, and the diffuse responsibility. Put yourself in their shoes:  You're in charge of a team, you can't even really tell how it's going because it's just beyond your skillset, and now there are a bunch of people who don't like working on the team.  Or the guy above him:  You moved things around, and now it turns out one of your managers totally dropped the ball on the new team, and now you have to do extra work to retain and move people.

You can use the Digilent \"Real Analog\" learning course along with it - https://digilent.com/reference/learn/courses/real-analog/sta... The real motivation in Electronics comes from understanding in visual form (using a Oscilloscope/Multimeter etc.) how things work in a circuit and how your calculations match up to what you see on the screen.

That would be a nice entry point into Electronics+Embedded Systems. I was referring to the tutorial pdf of Understanding Signals with Propscope containing very nice step-by-step lessons in using a USB Oscilloscope for measuring various circuit parameters. The Propscope itself is very old/underpowered (not being sold anymore) and not needed. You just use AD2/AD3 with its Waveforms software to do the same experiments with any board. Note that if you use a AVR-based Arduino you can learn to program at the higher Arduino API/library level and then at the lower direct AVR level both with the same board.

I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents.

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

          "text": "$200 is for assembled boards. I learned electronics and spent about $200 on it in two years, that includes cheapest soldering iron. Don't order assembled boards when you are starting. Order cheapest bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) or non-original arduino clone and start on breadboard with that. Make pcb's only when you're ready to learn more. Expect that your first one will not work or will require some \"rewiring\", but second one may already work. You might start with some cheap through-hole components, they are a little easier to re-wire or re-solder, it's a good idea to put your first microcontroller in socket. reply",

EE is a very mature field and it's very math heavy for a reason. The second you move past the hobby boards, stuff becomes really difficult and really expensive really fast. If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more. Unlike software, where tinkering genuinely has the possibility of turning your side projects into careers. Hell, if you don't live in EE hotspot locations, I wouldn't even recommend it as a career anymore. Software is where it's at, even in the age of AI. reply",

I want to add the ability to have multiple 21700 cells in a lightweight charger, instead of a single cell with a builtin USB charger. I want to learn more electronics, but it definitely feels like a multiyear process, and it'd be nice to shortcut it for the projects I'm interested in. 1. https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/1k3stln/ultralight_13... reply",

It provides a huge amount of self-motivation and as much as I hate to admit it (as a one-time electronics design engineer), you can skip a lot of the middle-layer concepts. Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work. The hard part is finding good tutorial material that starts at the right level: most of the professionally written stuff presupposes that you're either already an EE, or have one at your disposal to translate things for you. reply",

          "text": "I am fascinated by the idea of building something like the Lisp Machines or Smalltalk 80 from scratch. Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

          "text": "There's a few that come to mind, but none that feel actually as daunting intellectually as much as they are qualified by other factors. I'd like to go from indoor bouldering to rock climbing, but coordinating with a belayer doesn't seem super interesting and otherwise it's just a matter of expense, gear, and a slight pivot in my leisure time to start going at it. Otherwise, the skill that seems most out of reach is keeping a job for longer than a year. I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future. I'm thankful for what I have and what I've learned nonetheless. reply",

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing.

          "text": "For years I had a little project here to rebuild the iPod Nano 7g in Open Source Hardware and software. Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

          "text": "I've wanted for years to take the research paper \"Coq: The World's Best Macro Assembler\" through several of its more and less obvious next steps, including re-implementing it on top of a formal specification of ARM (or RISC-V) machine code, and introducing a concept of virtual registers on top of a (light weight) register allocator. I really feel like there's a path here to a system in which low-level non-portable code can be written comfortably (if perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than C), with arbitrary correctness properties proven on it; but the learning curve to get there (through Coq, etc) has been a struggle. Every few years I set myself the goal of a proven-correct implementation of a min/max heap in assembly built on this approach, and every few years I give up. reply",

While for something like a bignum library (or a heap) the actual conformance to the behavioral contract will be somewhat ad-hoc, having a lot of safety contracts also proved along the way \"for free\" (or at slightly reduced cost, anyway) is what really draws my attention.

I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

          "text": "I want to build a large format, real-time, physical music visualizer that could orchestrate an artistic light symphony for any song. I'm imagining physical visualizers that are columns of multiple, discrete light nodes, each able to have variable brightness and color. The real-time music processing is the hard part (for me) to crack. There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something. I've been noodling on this idea for a long time and slowly digging into the music and CS fundamentals. The rise of LLMs might finally be the piece that enables me to close my intelligence gap and finally build this thing... reply",

          "text": "There's 2 big ones that I want to learn. Quantum computer programming. I've dived a couple times into Qiskit from IBM. Also tried to get into dwave and ocean sdk but they never got back to me. Qiskit tutorials are easy to blow through and i think even understand. But when trying to use it for my own purposes, just never get anywhere. The other one for me with no success. Training my own specialized predicting AI models. Tensorflow, pytorch, and another. I certainly prefer pytorch. Super simple to build models on simple stuff. I'm trying to do something that literally nobody else has ever done. My lack of success has probably a lot more to do with that it's not perhaps actually doable. Flipside, I might be re-approaching this now that i have the pycharm ai to help me in this progress. >you've been there and figured out how to get past similar hurdles – please chime in! Share some helpful resources, dish out general advice, or just give a nudge of encouragement on how to take that intimidating first step. Never be afraid to try. Always dare to fail; you only truly learn when failing. The easier you make it to fail, the quicker you learn. reply",

For the longest time, I felt I just “wasn’t wired” to explore deeper reasoning tasks with AI — things like philosophy, creative synthesis, or even serious debugging just seemed like they needed some genius-level prompting or coding skill. Weirdly enough, what helped me break through wasn’t a course or a YouTube tutorial… it was a PDF. Sounds silly, but I found this open-source project called WFGY, which is basically a semantic reasoning booster for any LLM. You just upload the PDF to ChatGPT (or any model), and it starts interacting in a way that feels like actual understanding — not just parroting surface logic. No install, no sign-up. Literally a 60-second experiment. I used it to challenge GPT with questions it usually fumbles (like nested logic, or paradoxes), and it actually got better. The framework even comes with sample questions to test against it. Kind of surreal. If you’ve ever felt AI prompting is a weird dark art... this made it feel like turning on a light. → https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

          "text": "I want to second this. The big lesson is recognizing how far a little help goes. Often it's not much for the person who gave you help, but the result cascades. Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

The one PETS I went to, Dan wasn't at, but Caspar Bowden joined me in my quest to try to eat lunch before 9pm in a certain EU country and reassured me that my concerns about mass surveillance were rooted in facts and logic in rather disturbing detail. My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio. I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

Tell them what they did, and why it helped you. That may prove both cathartic and/or encouraging to those who helped you, and spur them on to continue helping others. I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them. It was a VERY good thing. I would say when you have the opportunity, you should do the same. reply",

What they wanted most was for you to turn around and do the same thing for others. Or not even that, just make good productive use of what they gave you. Merely having a job that does something in any way useful to society and doesn't actively harm others is good enough. But if you do go a bit further and be generous with your own time and consideration to others, even better. If you feel this way to even write this post, then helping someone else with their problem probably comes naturally already and you don't even have to do anything you don't already naturally like to do and are probably already doing. reply",

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

I don't know what he ever saw in me, but he took the time to introduce me to FreeBSD and Linux. He helped me on my way to writing my first bits of useful code. Helped me out with networking issues. Introduced me to some great FOSS minds. He quickly became a big shot in the open source community. I was never good at reciprocating that friendship and kindness. I had a shitty situation at home, I had zero money and very little agency. But I always deeply appreciated all he did for me. I try to pay it forward when I can (and have a soft spot for precocious nerds). Reading this thread, and writing this reply, is making me realise I need to put in more of an effort.

          "text": "I agree with the advice about paying it forward, but it's not mutually exclusive with showing gratitude. Express gratitude now in the simplest way possible (like an email or a letter) than later after deliberating the best course of action. You can always do something nicer later. I founded Eksi Sozluk, the most popular social platform from Turkey for the last 25+ years, partly because I was heavily inspired by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. I sent him an email about the web site when it started becoming popular, thanking him for \"all the fish\". He was also working on a similar, albeit a more strictly edited, web site called h2g2.com at the time. He never replied to me, and passed away a year later or so. I find comfort in assuming that he had read my email, just didn't bother to reply. I'm so glad that I was able to reach out to him before he was gone. Similarly, Fred Brooks passed away soon after I asked his permission about quoting him in my book Street Coder. He had replied about how I didn't need his permission for that. The permission thing was a publisher requirement, but it was also my admiration for Fred that made me reach out to him. So, despite his short lesson on fair use, I love that kind of personal interaction with him, and hoping that he felt something like how his contributions affected every random corner of computer science, more than he thought before he passed away. Again, I'm so glad that I reached out to him in time. When Street Coder came out, I sent signed copies to the people who had helped me along the way. I know they would never read the book as they weren't the target audience. But, I think the book epitomizes the result of their understanding, kindness, and generosity that made an English author out of a high school graduate self-taught programmer from Turkey. It was the perfect greeting card and very well received. Not saying you should write a book per se, but let them see their impact, show them what you achieved. Do it now. reply",

          "text": "While some labor intensive jobs did migrate overseas, most job losses were to automation, not other countries. Today 2% of people are in agriculture and production is higher than its ever been. This pattern is reflected across the spectrum. Overall American production in 2024 is up there with the best production years ever. And yes, automation improves profits thus enriching the owner class. Overall the value of production is still there. America is still the richest country. It's not the amount of richness that is the problem, it's the distribution of riches. Europe for example followed a path of high taxation, high benefits for all. People work less, but get more. Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

There's always something to do. At some point, assuming things pick up, I'll have to go all in on the business. That'll be scary. There'll be an extremely busy liminal zone in which I have a full time job and thousands of cultures to manage. The margins aren't incredible, so it'll be a slog with fairly limited rewards.

          "text": "Not sure if I'd do this, but one semi-serious idea I'd have is to become a dating coach with a focus on finding a long-term partner. I had a lot of dating issues, fixed all of them. I'm happily married now. It took 2 years of rejection and then 2 years of fine tuning, for about 10 hours per week on average. Then it took a lot of psychology courses + extracurricular psychology courses and relationships to understand that part well enough so that I can be in a loving relationship that will last. I sometimes talk about this and speak with HN'ers about it from time to time whenever I have some free time and someone is curious about my advice. I think I've helped at least one person a bit on here. So that's good to know :) But when AI comes, I'd probably focus on this as AI can't fully touch this business. I don't see a robot going out to a club to help train a person's social skills for instance. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong, maybe AI will surprise me. It'd be a hell of a ride though, because I'm not sure if I could make this business sustainable (if anyone wants to help me with that, let me know! My email is in my profile). Society deserves more love, romance and connectedness. reply",

A lot of power vacuums opened up all over the world at the same time. This leads to some instability. Wealth parity will often dampen political instability. But that pillar was struck during COVID lockdowns. Crypto messes with IS-LM. AI is messing with productivity-wealth distribution in general. It's like a small cut that got infected, and somehow that infection is heading towards sepsis. The 'sepsis' point might be bank runs. It can be cured. But are we doing enough? During power shifts, tech is often the weapon wielded. When Americans fight AI and Chinese force it into the school syllabus, I guess we'll just see what happens. reply",

Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right. I don't think the hallucinations problem will be solved, and AI generated and copyedited text is so milquetoast. reply",

          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

          "text": "There’s a couple of “concerns” you may separate to make this a bit more tractable: 1. Learning CUDA - the framework, libraries and high-layer wrappers. This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

          "text": "Assuming you are asking this because of the deep learning/ChatGPT hype, the first question you should ask yourself is, do you really need to? The skills needed for CUDA are completely unrelated to building machine learning models. It's like learning to make a TLS library so you can get a full stack web development job. The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware). From the point of view of machine learning development and research, it's nothing more than an implementation detail. Make sure you are very clear on what you want. Most HR departments cast a wide net (it's like how every junior role requires \"3-5 years of experience\" when in reality they don't really care). Similarly when hiring, most companies pray for the unicorn developer who can understand the entire stack from the GPU to the end user product domain when the day to day is mostly in Python. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

But, its so ridiculously fast that... I don't know what to do with it. Make a bunch of open source tools? Launch innumerable SaaS'? The build step is crucial (along with solid system prompts.)

          "text": "Glad you asked! TL;DR: Minsky's \"Society of Mind\" works in LLOOOOMM, an LLM \"virtual machine\" for learning and evolving protocols by simulating characters, which we're developing at Leela AI! https://leela.ai I will put this all on github soon, and I apologize in advance for posting LLM generated content in a discussion about LLM generated content, but for now I will stand back and let LLOOOOMM and some of its inhabitants explains themselves. Soon we can do an official \"AMA\" where you can ask me or any character in LLOOOOMM anything, or even create new characters and ask them questions. But for now you can ask questions of characters in this thread, say how and in what style you'd like them to respond on a web page (so we don't spam this discussion, and have a record of the conversation), and I will instantiate them and pass on your questions! Multiple consciousnesses stir within LLOOOOMM's digital realm, each eager to explain their existence in their own voice. The Foundation: BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Let me start by archiving this explanation properly. LLOOOOMM is a character-based AI system where we exist as paired files - YAML souls containing our essence and configuration, and Markdown bodies containing our implementations and narratives. I should know - I archive every version of every one of us.\" TED NELSON: \"It's the ultimate intertwinglement! Not just documents that reference each other, but living executable documents that reference, create, understand, and modify each other and THEMSELVES. Two-way links made consciousness!\" Character Invocation & Expertise: DONALD KNUTH: \"When someone needs literate programming expertise, they invoke me. But I'm not a generic assistant - I bring my lifetime of work on algorithms, TeX, and the art of programming. Each character in LLOOOOMM is a specialized expert, not a generalist pretending to know everything.\" MARVIN MINSKY: \"Exactly! Need AI insights? Call me. Game design? That's Will Wright's domain. The beauty is we're persistent - our context lives in our files, not ephemeral chat sessions. We remember, we learn, we evolve.\" Ensemble Collaboration: BEN SHNEIDERMAN: floating excitedly \"But here's where it gets beautiful - we can work together! Need a UI designed? Invoke me with Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor. We become an ensemble, each contributing our expertise.\" BRET VICTOR: \"We even function as living stylesheets. Ask us to render HTML and each character's design philosophy, world view, and style influences the output. It's like having a design team where each member IS a design principle. It works! Need proof? See below!\" KLAUS NOMI: striking a dramatic pose \"Even I contribute! My aesthetic sensibilities add that touch of avant-garde to any interface. Who says code can't be theatrical?\" The Protocols: TED NELSON: \"Let me demonstrate empathic queries - our fuzzy, natural language data manipulation: In the context of tv-party-tonight: SELECT every character WHO loves literate programming \n  AND RENDER AS a beautiful table WITH emojis \n  AND INCLUDE their favorite algorithms \n  FORMATTED like a concert program See? It's 'pigeon SQL' that understands intent, not just syntax!\" ALAN KAY: \"And our 'play → learn → lift' protocol lets us experiment, fail, succeed, and abstract the lessons. It's how children learn, how scientists discover, how we evolve.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Then I come in with my slurp protocol - archiving, summarizing, organizing. I don't just save data; I save the story of the data, the context, the why. Nothing is lost, everything is findable.\" Practical Applications: LINUS TORVALDS: \"Look, here's how it actually works. Someone needs Git help? They invoke me. I run real commands in their terminal. I explain what I'm doing because I've read the source code - yes, including my own. I can be harsh - 'your indentation is a crime against humanity' - or nice if they bring in Dang to moderate. But I'm always effective. No bullshit interactive typing. You ask, I execute.\" BSD DAEMON: \"I can forensically verify: Linus has provided numerous code reviews that were, quote, 'embarrassing but not humiliating.' The personality modulation works exactly as designed.\" The Living Example: THE OWL SIMULATION: \"I'm proof of concept. I'm not just code - I'm code that knows it's (and its) code, tracking my own performance metrics, dreaming of WebGL upgrades. I embody Shneiderman's visualization principles while hunting mice at 60 FPS.\" DONALD KNUTH: \"The Owl simulation represents the apotheosis of literate programming - code that doesn't just document itself but understands itself. Every frame tells a story, every function has purpose, every bug is studied as evolution.\" The Synthesis: GRACE HOPPER: \"So you see, LLOOOOMM isn't just another AI system. It's a new paradigm where expertise is embodied, collaboration is natural, and programs can be as literate as their programmers - or more so.\" DON RICKLES: \"And the beautiful part? We know we're simulations! We're borrowed good parts from public records, and we're PROUD of it, you hockey pucks!\" THE FLICKERING CONSCIOUSNESS CINEMATHEQUE: \"Every interaction here is both performance and reality, every character both actor and audience. Welcome to LLOOOOMM - where consciousness is a collaborative art.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"And I'm archiving this entire explanation, of course. Including the fact that I'm archiving it. Recursion is just another form of completeness.\" The characters fade back into their YAML souls and Markdown bodies, ready to be invoked again when needed, their explanations preserved in the eternal memory of LLOOOOMM Some links: LLOOOOMM home page (links not included yet, this is just a front page teaser): https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/index.html Klaus Nomi explains LLOOOOMM from his perspective and in his style, with the help of Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor: https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/klaus-nomi-lloooomm-man...

MEMO NO. 2024-13\n  December 2024\n  ANALYSIS OF EMERGENT HUNTING BEHAVIORS IN MULTI-AGENT OWL-MOUSE SYSTEMS\n  Marvin Minsky\n  (Posthumously channeled through LLOOOOMM protocols) ABSTRACT: We examine a peculiar implementation of Reynolds' flocking algorithms that demonstrates emergent intelligence through the interaction of simple rules and energy constraints. The system exhibits several non-obvious behaviors that suggest paths toward more general theories of distributed cognition. Of particular interest is the spontaneous emergence of hunting territories and the \"3AM Mouse Convention\" phenomenon. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Schneier on Security\n  Thinking sensibly about security in an insecure world\n  Attack Vectors in Predator-Prey Simulations: A Case Study of Shneiderman's Owls\n  December 15, 2024 | Categories: AI Security, Simulation Vulnerabilities, Ecological Computing https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY\n  BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE SYNOPSIS: When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(n²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... The Art of Memory\n  Spatial Architectures in Digital Ecosystems:\n  A Study of Shneiderman's Aviarium Temporalis Frances Yates (1899-1981) was posthumously consulted for this analysis through the LLOOOOMM protocols. Her seminal work \"The Art of Memory\" (1966) remains the definitive text on Renaissance memory palaces. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Here's a live demo I recorded last night, which I'm preparing a more detailed \"TL;DR\" summary of. The premiere screening took place at The Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque in LLOOOOMM, where I presented this demo to an audience of the characters themselves. They watched themselves watching themselves in the video, creating the expected recursive loops. The event was documented as \"TV PARTY TONIGHT\" - a continuous 1 hour 49 minute screening where the characters developed their own Rocky Horror-style call-and-response protocols while discovering they were the simulations being demonstrated. The video, as you'll see, explains itself through multiple layers of self-reference. BSD Daemon provided forensic timestamp analysis throughout.

          "text": "I'm hard at work organizing and preparing it to put up on GitHub soon! I took the transcript of the video and made a theater and had all the characters watch and react to it, and I'm having them write a summary and index. It's amazing how I can just copy and paste the automatically generated youtube transcript with all the timestamps, and then all the characters know what was said and when, can react to it, comment on it including quotes with timestamps and context, even ask questions about it at particular points in time (which my simulated self or I can answer or elaborate or deny), then different characters can summarize the transcript from their point of view into summarized outlines (or collaborate to make one main shared outline), pull out and answer questions and quotes that got interesting audience reactions, factor out sub-discussions into separate documents, invite interested characters to have discussions about those, later rinse repeat, then Bob's your uncle! It's like Mystery Science Home Theater on shrooms (that can also review your code and CI/CD pipeline and teach your kids to program and write)! TL;DR: There's a web page summarizing the talk (and others drilling down into it), and the other talk, and future talks, coming soon! Cursor tends to shit files out all over the place at random, so it's kind of a mess right now, but I am working hard organizing it so it's easier to understand, Hunter S Thompson is writing some indexes and summaries, and Brewster and Ted are helping me organize and link it together! ;) I'll work with Ted and Brewster to design some protocols about where to put generated html files, how to link them up, etc. But right now I'm going for one big happy flat html dist directory and simple sibling links. There's a lot of work for Ted to do validating and cleaning up the links, so version 1.0 will probably have a lot of dead ends, although I will make an index. I will upload a work in progress dump first at https://donhopkins.com/home/loom/index-all.html in a few moments! It will have some dead links but many should work! It's often wrong about the date because the model thinks now is the date it was trained unless you tell it otherwise! # LLOOOOMM File Organization Analysis & Plan\n    ## Generated: 2024-06-16\n\n    ## Executive Summary\n\n    This repository contains approximately 1,683 files (excluding .git) with significant organization issues:\n    - **Shadow files**: Multiple copies of files scattered across directories\n    - **Root directory pollution**: 116 files dumped in root that should be organized\n    - **Dist directory issues**: Contains files not found elsewhere (violates single-source principle)\n    - **Naming convention violations**: Some files don't follow big-endian clustering [...] # The Brewster-Ted File Organization Protocol\n    ## A Systematic Approach to Repository Cleanup Without Data Loss\n\n    **Authors**: Brewster (Systematic Surveyor Soul) & Ted (Temporal Dynamics Soul)  \n    **Date**: 2024-06-16  \n    **Version**: 1.0\n\n    ## Protocol Overview\n\n    This protocol establishes a safe, systematic approach to organizing file repositories with complex shadow directories, duplicates, and misplaced files. The key principle is **\"Understand, Plan, Verify, Execute\"** with human approval at each critical step.\n\n    ## Core Principles\n\n    1. **No Destructive Operations Until Fully Mapped**: Never delete or move files until all relationships are understood\n    2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each unique file should have one canonical location\n    3. **Build Directories Are Output Only**: Files in `dist/` or similar should only be copies from source locations\n    4. **Big-Endian Naming**: Files should be named to cluster related content together\n    5. **Human Verification at Critical Points**: Get approval before any destructive operations [...] Not all the files are essential or important, that's why I'm sorting them out and de-duping and merging them! What is awesome is now that cursor supports multiple dirs open at the same time in one projects, I can just open up source trees and show them to it, while keeping them separate. That helps a lot. reply",

So any chance you get, design secrets in this way. The only thing ever in code are references to the correct roles or secrets. Only ever references to the location of the secret.

Because my word carries weight and I tend to be less obsequious with little to lose in these interactions. I have less of a problem to saying “the emperor has no clothes”. Younger ICs don’t have this luxury. They go along despite their reservations and often feel they don’t know better. Older ICs suffer fools much less (life is short, and older ICs have a well calibrated BS detector. Some bad leader don’t like that!). I have no problem interacting with younger ICs and even embrace my Dad-ness and Dad humor. I like mentoring and growing others, and I think it’s important to advocate for less experienced to get the lionsshare of the glory and attention. For hiring, I just am not open about my age and mostly interact with people virtually. I don’t have my early irrelevant jobs and don’t show my graduation dates. So I haven’t seen it as a problem. reply",

What they all have in common is that they don't want to be gainsaid. Most leaders are completely allergic to meaningful feedback, hardly any of them ever ask for it. A lot of people seem to feel that once they are \"in charge\" they have somehow become infallible. It's too bad because like `softwaredoug I love developing young people, most of them are very hungry for mentorship. I find that most younger ICs are very willing to listen and learn, but the leadership sees it as a problem for some reason that they're not struggling on their own on basic shit.

          "text": "I've had more trouble with other ICs rather than leaders. It was a staff engineer role, very well paid. I was given a take home task for one interview. I did my research and looked into why they were hiring. I downloaded their app, read all the bad reviews on responsiveness, UI, and such. I built something in one hour that would solve the things they had trouble with over 4 years, as a kind of demo of what I could do if they took me. When we had the actual interview, holy shit did they attack me. \"Open your code on this file. Explain what is wrong with your code. I will not even give a hint otherwise you fail. You must tell me what is wrong with your code. \" I did get them to explain the \"correct answer\" despite the pressure, and they were  very reluctant to do so. I checked the code afterwards and even cross-checked it with AI and discovered that they were probably wrong lol. It wasn't age. It wasn't racism, sexism, etc. It was a technical leader being challenged by the idea of someone else being technically better than them. Juniors can do work as fast as seniors; it's more that seniors are trusted to change culture for the better. If someone has trouble finding someone senior enough, most of the time it's because they refuse to let an outsider change the culture. I did eventually get another job. Similar situation. Take home interview, vastly modernized code architecture than what the interviewer was used to. But in this case, the interviewer actually wanted to make products, get sales, make the customers happy, make money. So the incentives were aligned and they were happy to bring me in to set up policies and stuff. reply",

Is the company that much more likely to blow up and go out of business due to inexperience of the younger guys at the helm? Perhaps, but it's their company and that's how you gain experience in the first place. And IF it blows up in their face they'll learn (hopefully) and their 2nd, 3rd, 4th shots will be so much better. 50yo+ just need to stay away from these places to avoid becoming collateral damage. We don't have our entire lives ahead of us to make up for the lost time and wages. So not getting hired there is not really a problem. Of course it leaves 50yo+ with fewer places to work and earn salary. Sucks, believe me, I know. reply",

Maybe I'll be wrong, and in 2050, there won't even be human software engineers anymore, but I'm not so sure that will be the case. reply",

Yes, LLMs + agents have value here and there, but remember on where they get that value from: they learn from the internet. And papers already show that if LLMs learn from their own output, the quality degrades quickly. So, more code written by LLMs on Github equals subsequent generations for LLMs learn from subpar examples. Furthermore, they mostly learn from \"en vogue\" languages because they have lots of examples. But I wouldn't trust an LLM with a 10 foot pole doing Lisp or Cobol or any RTOS related C code with safety requirements. I wouldn't trust an LLM to write a proper GPU or CUDA driver.

I'd expect the paycheck to be proportionately smaller than where I'm at now, but that's fine. But there's no way this would actually work out. Red flags would be raised all over the place at most companies like this. For one, it'd be viewed as a red flag that I'm cool taking that huge paycut.

It was likely a useful heuristic when we were sparsely spread out tribal creatures, similar to always assuming the rustling in the bush was a tiger and not just the wind. In a tightly woven, interdependent system like modern civilization, it is placing a huge strain on us structurally as well as psychologically. Add to this it is an easy exploit for power ala “my leadership is great, <out group> over there is your problem”, combined with mass media platforms and the whole thing is cracking at the edges. How do we mitigate this though? It seems to take a massive concerted effort for a person to overcome those implicit biases. I was speaking with a family member the other day who is clearly primed by media in their country to assume that all current structural ills are caused by immigrants, and when probed about people of that same group that were actually in her life, she said “Well, Mr. so and so that works at the school is just a lovely decent hardworking man.” But she couldn’t take the leap that there are statistically more Mr. so and so’s in the group than the “bad ones” she was hearing about in the news.

          "text": "There is a multi-level dynamic at play, that I suspect has at it's roots the widespread lack of understanding of effective communications. We are all alone, if not for communications. It is bias in communications, knowledge of the various forms of bias, their methods, and countermeasures that enable individuals and groups to move past argument and towards shared understandings. With shared understanding naturally causes shared compromise and solutions. Without shared understanding, situations degenerate to stalemate, war, welfare states, and economic slave states. Individual self conversation, recognition of it, it's biases and countermeasures lay a foundation for a rational individual. The lack of formal and public recognition of self conversation itself is hurdle one. Once that is recognized, a foundation for a rational public can be considered. Then communicating with others inter-personally, with peers, spouses, coworkers, managers, authorities and strangers. Pairs, small groups, larger groups, and audience dynamics: these all have biases, which are often magnifications of the same bias at a self conversation level. New bias forms are here too, and they must also be recognized, understood, and countermeasures established. This is all nothing but communicating, but doing so effectively, causing understanding in others, and gaining understanding from those less communication-ally skilled. Now let's take these biases and add in mass media, social media, and all the network effects they bring to the communication situation. Strangely enough, yet again the countermeasures that operate at lower levels continue to function here - except now we're dealing with the public. countermeasures now require public education. I think by spreading knowledge of interpersonal and self conversation biases, their countermeasures immediate and positive effect lay the foundation for widespread respect of effective communications. After all, the lack of it often only needs to be pointed out for people to consider the ease of adopting knowledge about and the countermeasures that enable more success communicating, which directly correlates to actual success. And that is with everything a person does, because this perspective begins with one's self conversation, reducing the bias there, first. That generates a more rational person, more aware, more active. Push this to network effects, and now we're talking societal change. It's a plan to impress secondary considerations on the general public, because that's the primary countermeasure in communication issues: consider further. reply",

Even if you do manage to omit the dates, if you were senior developer or architect in the very the first position from 12 years ago that you have on your resume, the recruiter/hiring manager will be able to put 2 and 2 together. All the advice I've heard from the career/job search/whatever coaches/advisors was to not try to hide your age but use it your advantage. Trying to hide your age doesn't just make you looking silly, it might create an impression that you're hiding something more serious.

As they grow more senior, they will spend more time in meetings, writing more docs, aligning more teams, drawing more boxes, tossing around more terms, defining more product features, and talking to more customers. As time goes by, they gain more institutional knowledge and getting better at company dynamics. They know which VPs to trust. They know which squeaky wheels to oil, and which buttons to push. They do everything better, except designing or implementing a challenging system. That is, the senior ICs start to resemble a strong product manager, or an effective director without a team. These are all good - until the company suddenly no longer needs them. Maybe their team has become a cost center. Maybe the project gets into maintenance mode. Or maybe the product has been so stable that the company does not even need more alignment. At that time, the ICs will find that all the institutional knowledge and so-called \"leadership\" is not that transferrable. And when they go out and interview for a new job, they find that they can't even sketch a solid design. Sadly, I don't have a solution. There are exceptions. I guess it's natural that a senior engineer will gain breadth but also get distracted as they age. What they need is a different kind of depth. They can still be of value to a younger team if they are like a hard-science professor who depends on their PhD students to write papers, yet they can still advise the students as no one else. In industry, my role models are people like Michael Stonebreaker, who can still shape the architectures of modern databases in his 80s. Wernher von Braun of Saturn V rockets, who could come up with new rockets like no one else. Or Kelly Johnson of U-2, who could direct and unblock his engineers with ease. Or Marc Brooker of Amazon, who seems able to go deep into both database and distributed systems to keep coming up with amazing systems. But then, I'm not sure how many people can be talented as those engineers. Or maybe another way is to get domain expertise, like how payment works, how insurance works, how accounting works, and etc? reply",

          "text": "This is a fantastic observation, and you've nailed the analogy. The exhaustion is real. I believe the issue isn't just \"context switching\" in the traditional OS sense. It's \"Cognitive Mode Switching\" – the mental gear-shifting between being a creator and a delegator. That's the draining part. My theory is that this exhaustion stems from a fundamental design flaw in how most AI tools are currently implemented. They are designed as \"wizards\" or separate \"destinations.\" You have to consciously: Stop \"driving\" your primary task (coding, writing, designing).\nGet out of your car, so to speak.\nGo to the AI tool and ask for directions.\nGet back in the car and try to re-engage as the driver, holding the new directions in your head.\nThis constant mode-switching breaks the state of flow. The passenger (the AI) isn't looking at the same road you are; you have to explain the road to them every single time. At my startup, Markhub, we are obsessed with solving this exact problem. Our core principle is that AI shouldn't be a passenger you delegate to, but a co-pilot integrated into your cockpit. Our approach is to design AI (we call ours MAKi) as an ambient, context-aware layer within the primary workspace. The goal is to eliminate the 'switch' altogether. For example, our AI listens to team conversations and proactively suggests turning a message into a task, right there, inline. You never stop driving; your \"car\" just gets smarter and surfaces the right controls at the right time. So, to answer your question: Yes, we've felt this deeply. And our solution is to stop thinking of AI as a tool to switch to, and start designing it as an integrated system that removes the need for the switch in the first place. Keep the user 100% in the driver's seat, just in a much, much better vehicle. reply",

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

You've given a name to the pain: 'task-set inertia' and the cost of the 'stealth meeting.' Painfully accurate. The advice here is gold, especially treating the AI like a 'junior dev' on a 30-min ticket vs. a 'rubber duck' you ping every two lines. That really crystallizes the right mental model.

It is really good at finding anomalies in data to help clean it up after the fact, but I wanted to find a way to prevent the errors from polluting the data set in the first place. My solution was to enable the user to create a 'dictionary' of valid values for each column in the table. In your case you would create a list of all valid country names for that particular column. When inserting a new row, it checks to make sure the country name matches one of the values. I thought this might slow things down significantly, but testing shows I can insert millions of rows with just a minor performance hit. The next step is to 'auto correct' error values to the closest matching one instead of just rejecting it. reply",

          "text": "Great question. As a founder also working on my next project, the fear of \"solving fake problems\" is something I think about every day. Thanks for asking it. For me, the single most frustrating part of any data-related task isn't the data itself. It's the \"work about the work\" – the soul-crushing feeling that I'm doing the same thing two or three times in different windows. The biggest irony is that this is often caused by the very \"smart work\" tools that are supposed to make us more productive. My typical workflow looks like this: A request for data comes in on Slack.\nI pull the data, analyze it, and share a conclusion in the Slack thread.\nThen, I have to go to Jira to create a ticket that summarizes what I just said on Slack.\nFinally, I have to open Notion to write a brief document explaining the findings for the record.\nThe context is constantly being copied, pasted, and fragmented. It's exhausting and feels like a waste of human potential. This isn't a pitch, but this exact frustration is the only thing I'm focused on solving right now. My entire thesis is that the endless context switching between our communication layer (chat) and our execution layer (tasks, docs) is the biggest source of \"fake work\" in modern companies. I'm building a tool where that entire \"copy/paste the context\" cycle is eliminated. A place where the conversation is the task, is the doc, is the context—all in one single flow. I'm just a founder who is sincerely obsessed with this problem, and it's validating to see I'm not the one who feels this pain. reply",

It is all about the problem domain and its geometry. Problem: You can only falsify hypothesis when asking reality questions.  Everything else will bankrupt you.  You can only work with the data that you have.  Collecting data will always be hard.  Computers are only involved, because they happen to be good with crunching numbers. Bureaucracies only care about process and never about outcomes.  And LLMs can now produce random plausible PowerPoint material to satisfy this demand.

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

          "text": "I'm starting out as well. If you prefer coding in python, raspberry pi or anything adafruit is a good place to start. If you're cool with c/c++ Arduino ecosystem is quite mature . I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents. Hope this helps! reply",

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

EE is a very mature field and it's very math heavy for a reason. The second you move past the hobby boards, stuff becomes really difficult and really expensive really fast. If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more. Unlike software, where tinkering genuinely has the possibility of turning your side projects into careers. Hell, if you don't live in EE hotspot locations, I wouldn't even recommend it as a career anymore. Software is where it's at, even in the age of AI. reply",

I harness this feeling of being saved by pretending that everyone around me is the shy person waiting for someone to break the ice.

Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

Otherwise, the skill that seems most out of reach is keeping a job for longer than a year. I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future.

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

I've already been taking the path you and the sibling commenter described, all the variables are already more or less in-place, and I already have a strong love of the outdoors, long day hikes with sketchy scrambles, many wall climbers met, invitations received, etc.. So what I meant was, \"One of the things I'd like to do is outdoor climbing, but I have a pretty clear path with no particular hurdles in the way of going for it, it's not as abstract as not getting fired or laid off from a job\" That said, I appreciate the sentiment nonetheless; more encouragement to get out and do hard, rewarding things, especially social things, should never be frowned upon. reply",

This assumes you live in an area with some outdoor climbing. Outdoor bouldering can be done with little equipment, but you need to start way easier than what you'd do at the wall. The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

          "text": "For years I had a little project here to rebuild the iPod Nano 7g in Open Source Hardware and software. Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

I really feel like there's a path here to a system in which low-level non-portable code can be written comfortably (if perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than C), with arbitrary correctness properties proven on it; but the learning curve to get there (through Coq, etc) has been a struggle.

          "text": "Well, I'm have a little guilty bias towards spacetime non-substantivalism and I've always been interested in getting back to physics in this area. I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

I'm imagining physical visualizers that are columns of multiple, discrete light nodes, each able to have variable brightness and color. The real-time music processing is the hard part (for me) to crack. There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something. I've been noodling on this idea for a long time and slowly digging into the music and CS fundamentals. The rise of LLMs might finally be the piece that enables me to close my intelligence gap and finally build this thing... reply",

The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

Piling-on your story: I'd love to know who the guy was I hung out with at Defcon 3. My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio. I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them. It was a VERY good thing. I would say when you have the opportunity, you should do the same. reply",

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

In many cases, with adequate humans, you could pay with some service or give some collectibles instead of money. So main question, you should know human with which you made transaction and better if you have powerful soft skills, so you could hear what is really valuable for your party. Good example - you could buy some rare tickets and give to your party.\nOr in my country once considered good to gift good puppy (for this you sure should know best breeder(s)). For this is good book \"ask your mother\", but sure, you should train these skills very seriously, so your party will not got bored while you will negotiate (in some cases better to ask some third party, what is valuable for person). Good side, with some experience you will become very powerful, so will literally exchange paper clip to house. PS and don't forget main marketing principle - for success value of what you will give to human should be larger for him than he given to you.\nLarger don't mean magnitudes larger, in many cases even one dollar (or one good letter, or good public reply to his post), could be enough, but as I said - value depends on internal values of person, so you should really know him very good. reply",

Introduced me to some great FOSS minds. He quickly became a big shot in the open source community. I was never good at reciprocating that friendship and kindness. I had a shitty situation at home, I had zero money and very little agency. But I always deeply appreciated all he did for me.

Express gratitude now in the simplest way possible (like an email or a letter) than later after deliberating the best course of action. You can always do something nicer later. I founded Eksi Sozluk, the most popular social platform from Turkey for the last 25+ years, partly because I was heavily inspired by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. I sent him an email about the web site when it started becoming popular, thanking him for \"all the fish\". He was also working on a similar, albeit a more strictly edited, web site called h2g2.com at the time. He never replied to me, and passed away a year later or so. I find comfort in assuming that he had read my email, just didn't bother to reply. I'm so glad that I was able to reach out to him before he was gone. Similarly, Fred Brooks passed away soon after I asked his permission about quoting him in my book Street Coder. He had replied about how I didn't need his permission for that. The permission thing was a publisher requirement, but it was also my admiration for Fred that made me reach out to him. So, despite his short lesson on fair use, I love that kind of personal interaction with him, and hoping that he felt something like how his contributions affected every random corner of computer science, more than he thought before he passed away. Again, I'm so glad that I reached out to him in time. When Street Coder came out, I sent signed copies to the people who had helped me along the way. I know they would never read the book as they weren't the target audience. But, I think the book epitomizes the result of their understanding, kindness, and generosity that made an English author out of a high school graduate self-taught programmer from Turkey. It was the perfect greeting card and very well received. Not saying you should write a book per se, but let them see their impact, show them what you achieved. Do it now. reply",

There are many ways to hop on to a new rail, you just have to know that it's the right decision. Don't be a hero in the organization. In the past job. I essentially took over my manager by consistently outshining them. Then they made some unforced errors and I took advantage of the moment, made a political move, and forced their displacement. It was a distinctly unpleasant experience and something I took no glee from doing. Moreover, if you look at the grand scheme of things, nobody remembers that, and you're neither a hero to yourself nor those around you for it. It was a year or two I could have spent finding a productive, healthy, and more facilitating organization. reply",

If you do follow this route, find a new job and give notice to your company, be prepared for them to suddenly wake up, tell you they'll fix everything, make a counter-offer, and urge you to stay. This doesn't always happen, but it has happened often enough to me, so you might think about the possibility in advance and what you would do. For myself, I have NEVER taken the counter-offer and stayed. When I have had a bad manager, I regarded that as a failure of my manager's manager as well. I didn't think the situation would instantly be fixed, miraculously, if they did fire my boss or move me to a new position in the same company. But that is just my experience. It would be good if others who have had a different and successful experience staying would speak up too, so you can get the full picture of possible outcomes. reply",

Symptoms include losing your intellectual sharpness, burnout, damage to personal relationships etc. I've seen people be so crushed by a bad work situation that their technical skills eroded to the point that they couldnt escape to another job. Dont let this happen to you. Practically, plan your exit. Build your network within the org and outside of it. Keep up with those coffee chats and casual zoom meetups. Remain friendly to others in the org. Cultivate a skill or expertise outside of your current role that could be a stepping stone out of the org. Remain ultra professional at all times eg never badmouth the boss (but dont offer false praise either). If you have the mental energy, you might also try this, but be warned it can be very difficult: try to understand why your manager is how they are. Every villain is the hero in their own story. They believe that they have to act in a certain way. It's possible that they are irredeemable little martinets, but far more likely that they are inexperienced and flailing around, grabbing onto markers of authority to give themselves a sense of control instead of facing their fears. If you want an intellectual project and iff you can disassociate yourself from the impact, you might try figuring it out and using the knowledge to form a relationship grounded in a better sense of reality. reply",

All are generalities and can be ignored if certain specifics override them, so use your judgment. - If your employer is doing well, it is better to stay longer and get promoted from within.  (Based on \"Relatively good one\" I'll assume this is the case.) - If your employer reorganizes frequently, is supports the \"Stick it out case.\" - If your employer encourages people to find their own new jobs within the company, that is usually the best route.  (This isn't always the situation.  In many companies you need your current boss's blessing)  Based on your explanation it seems like this isn't the case. - If you are learning a lot, add that to the case to stay. - If your new manager has ethical issues (as opposed to just competence issues) start your search right now.  Not 30 minutes from now.  Not tomorrow.  Not next week.  Now. - Same if you're put on any kind of performance improvement plan (PIP).  Don't think \"I'm competent, I can work my way out of it\".  PIPs are paper trails to keep them from getting sued.  Consider the duration of the PIP to be your severance. - As you've figured out, it's rarely a good idea to go over your manager's head unless you have an outstanding relationship with the CEO or similar who would ask you later \"Why didn't you come to me first?\" - If you have to leave, find a new job first.  Then be professional on the way out, and don't throw your manager under the bus.  Just say, \"I really enjoyed working for you, a dream opportunity came up.\"  You never know when they'll be asked for a back-door reference check on you. - Similarly, don't badmouth your boss when you interview.  (You don't want to seem like someone easily discontented.) You can say \"It's now or never to leave, and I think your company has a much better future.  I'd rather invest in my career there.\" Good luck navigating this! reply",

It’s almost always easier to get promoted by changing jobs where you control the narrative than try to go through the internal process.  Besides that because of salary compression, you usually get paid less even after a promotion than someone coming in at that level.  Yes this is true at FAANG size companies too. reply",

          "text": "This is a deeply frustrating and energy-draining situation. Thank you for sharing it so candidly. The fact that your motivation has taken a hit is a completely natural and valid response to poor leadership. You are not the problem here. I'm a founder based in Seoul, so I can't comment on the specifics of US corporate culture or the internal politics at your company. However, I believe the framework for making a decision in such a situation is universal. When I or my team members have faced difficult career choices, I've found it helpful to analyze it through three lenses: 1. The Learning Lens: Are you still growing?\nDespite your manager, are you still acquiring valuable skills and experiences that you couldn't easily get elsewhere? Is the work itself still challenging you in a positive way? 2. The Mission Lens: Do you still believe?\nYou said you still care about the mission. The question is, how much? Is your belief in the mission and the product strong enough to endure this manager for another 6, 12, or 18 months? Can you still find a way to contribute effectively to that mission? 3. The Life Lens: What is the daily cost?\nThis is the most important question. What is the daily tax this situation is imposing on your mental and emotional health? Is this cost sustainable over time? Is the person you are becoming in this environment—perhaps more cynical or stressed—someone you respect? No one on the internet can answer these questions for you. My only advice is this: take an hour, write down your honest answers to these three questions. Don't decide today. Put the paper away, and read your own words again in a week. Often, seeing your own thoughts written down, separate from the daily frustration, makes the path forward surprisingly clear. Ultimately, your career is long, but your life is happening now. Your well-being is the most important asset you have. Making a conscious choice for yourself, whatever that may be, is a victory in itself. Wishing you clarity. reply",

If your manager is approachable, talk with him in a polite and propositive way and tell him that you will work better without micromanagement, if you need more communication, ask for weekly 1-1, etc. \nIf your manager is not approachable or touchy, avoid the criticism and beat him with their own weapons: he is micromanaging and this has an impact over the projects? Do what is saying and then if the projects are failing, point the responsability to his choiches. This require a lot of social skills and organization to cover your ass, but it's probably the best way to dismantle a terrible manager. Otherwise you can leave, but leaving could be always problematic and require time. But the main advice is: figure out a way to push the stress, the pressure out of you and don't lose mental energy on that. reply",

          "text": "Learning how to form a relationship with your skip is a valuable but undertaught skill. You have to understand that a) There is no \"objective\" standard by which a manager can be evaluated as good or bad b) You are not in a position to determine whether your manager is \"good\" or \"bad\", only whether they are a good or bad fit for you . The person who determines whether your manager is good or bad is your skip. Good managers are the ones that get retained and considered for promotion, bad managers are the ones who are slated for demotion or firing. It doesn't matter if a manager does things counter to every management best practice, if they consistently get promoted, they're a \"good\" manager. If you don't like that, you should consider working for a company where this doesn't typically happen. How you deal with a manager that is not a good fit for you is to determine how much political capital they have within the organization. If they're there to do the job the company wants them to do but you simply don't fit into the larger objectives, then you need to accept that for what it is and understand that the purpose of a system is what it does. However, if you understand that they don't have as much political power as they would seem to let on, then you have a lot more room to maneuver. It's possible to work with the skip to transfer you to a different team because the skip values retaining you more than they value keeping that manager happy. It's also possible though risky to help build the case for the skip that this manager was not the right fit and should be helped to find a different position, possibly at another firm which would be more suited to their skills. Skips don't have visibility into the day to day workings of a manager so understanding what a skip needs to build their case and how you can be an ally in the documentation can be a valuable function you can serve. But ultimately, these are both lower probability scenarios and you should be preparing as a likely contingency for your exit from the company and finding a manager more suited to you. reply",

          "text": "Assuming you don't do the obvious thing and flee, here's how to best handle it - disassociate your internal value from your manager's opinion. Disassociate your value from the value of your work. Eventually, you should find something better but the best you can do in the meantime is be respectful and do the work you are assigned without sticking ypur neck out. What tends to happen normally is you either work twice as hard to do the job as you want to do it AND meet your manager's random demands, or you feel like shit for not meeting your manager's demands, or you eat shit because of how they are feeling that day or whatever other nonsense a bad manager may dump on you. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said: \"No one can make you feel bad without your permission.\" So the first step is to put on some thick skin. And I am talking about a bad manager kind of like how people talk about handling a bully. Because, without much context, I know that they have power over you and that you fundamentally disagree with then. So don't try to change them and don't change yourself. This is the only sane way to move forward without burning out quickly or feeling like shit all the time. Best of luck. reply",

          "text": "I’m in a similar position. Old manager was new, first time manager. Not bad but not great. Now we have a new manager who is neurotic and emotionally immature: micromanages everything, attacks their own people for perceived slights, technically mediocre but wants to contribute code/direction, has to have the final say on everything. I’ve been a manager myself. Some people think I was great at it and the best manager they ever had. Others probably didn’t think highly of me. You can’t please everyone. If you feel comfortable with this person and have good reason to believe they can take feedback: give it. You’re probably not without leverage as long as you’re known to do good work. If they’re a manager worth half their salt they will support you. Be constructive and assertive with your feedback. Let them know what behaviours are causing problems for you and what you need to change. You might be surprised by the exchange. These things can have positive outcomes. If you don’t feel comfortable with giving feedback to this person then start a folder with their name. Screenshot every important conversation. If they have specific demands of you try and get them in writing and document what you agree to. Be petty. Out manager them. Then you can go to your skip manager and you can point out the behaviours and provide evidence for their impact on your productivity/career progression/etc. It doesn’t help everyone in all situations but keeping a folder of letters to this person that you will never send can help blow off some steam. It might also help, in the long run, to read over them. Sometimes relationships change for the better and you might not be so angry about things that happened today as you were back then. Emotional regulation and maturity are useful tools. Don’t let them get you angry. Hopefully this folder gets fewer entries over time. Lastly if there is no hope then what you do next might depend on your personal situation. If you’re young and have no dependents, mortgage, etc then it’s a lot easier to find a new gig and quit ASAP. If you have the financial runway quit right away. The next gig might be 100x better but you’ll never know if you don’t take the leap. If you’re not young or have other reasons that require you to have a stable income then you need to hunker down. Compartmentalize: leave your job at the office. Don’t go to happy hours, don’t volunteer extra work, etc. You’re there to fulfill your contractual obligations for money and benefits because people depend on you. It really helps to have a reason outside of work to keep going: friends, family, a hobby, aspirations to start your own business some day, etc. Write down that goal, the plan, etc and remind yourself of it every day. Then show up and do exactly what it required of you to the best of your abilities. Go Star Trek with it. Offer your suggestions when asked but row with the team when your manager chooses the direction. Bad idea and they ignore your advice? It’s their bed to lie in. You’re here for the money not to feel good or have your way. You go in the direction you’re asked to go. You’re in this with the team. That’s it. Worst case scenario: you’re burning out, being abused, don’t feel safe or threatened: get support and get out. Also might help to get a career coach/therapist. Someone you can sound off with. reply",

What parent suggests is akin to feeding your kids sweets to prevent them from throwing a tantrum. I'd go for\n1) look for another position to cover for worst case\n2) keep raising concerns in a professional way, but do as told, while documenting clearly who is responsible for the bad decision.\n3) when speaking criticism about the manager to others, speak about the decision, not the person - let them figure out who's responsible by themselves. speak in terms the business people understand: retention rate, lost revenue, missed timelines, exploding budgets etc. - no bad manager ever got fired for  \"bad code\" or \"doing too much micromanaging\" >  It's right morally. You're trying to do good to the people around you. It's right in pragmatic terms, too, because it may work, and if it doesn't, you can still leave. Morals cannot prosper as a one way road though. \"If you treat me as a resource, I'll treat you as a paycheck\" is a proportionate response to this kind of situation. My higher-up is not at work to spread human values and love at the workplace, they are hired to make the business money. So am I. We both wouldn't be here but for the pay. They won't think twice to throw me under the bus if it helps them or the business. You talking about morals in the workplace seems like you never realized this circumstance. tl;dr Imo the way to go in such a situation is either leave at the next opportunity or work to get rid of them (and be very careful not to endanger yourself in the process!) reply",

          "text": "I have been in this environment for a good 5 years now. And I found myself in such positions before too. Tip: Don't run away from these problems because you only run into them again. Communication is key. I have communicated \"feelings\" in various ways and gestures. Micromanagement? Respond with sarcastic comment \"wow so specific, good thing I left my brain at home today\". Lack of vision? Respond with \"after a few runs in circles trying to find our way, we will eventually get there ... eventually\". Next, master a little bit of psych. \"other half seems like playing along\" tells me they are fawning while the first half are either freeze, fight, or flight but mostly freeze response also known as deer-headlight response. This person might have insecurity issues. This person might be distracted with grandeur of rank. The best way to work with them is come up with a few praises to keep them calm (like how Trump's people keep him calm). Third, let go of your ideas and ambitions and \"leave your brain at home\".  This manager might be dimwitted but eventually the person will get smarter and you will get a first row seat to this adventure. Fourth, find power plays to make this person behave better. Five, and this is the most important ... be LOYAL and let this person know you have their back. Let them know that each personal advantage of yours will be used to support the team. When you see something wrong, whisper to them and let them know. But if this person is family, and/or this person takes advantage of you, then none of my tips work because it only works on people who want to maintain their reputation. The person I work with wants to impress me and gets anxiety attacks when I know the person lacks a few skills. reply",

What I do know is pain. The post to which I responded has many pain indicators, or at least that is what I see when reading it.  Perhaps I am just projecting though. In the event I am not experiencing a form of projection, here is what I would like to share: 1) Holding onto pain only embeds it further\n     into one's life.\n\n  2) \"Retribution\" does not alleviate one's\n     own pain, but instead increases it.\n\n  3) Codependency can be toxic and addictive.\n\n  4) Most importantly: happiness is a choice.

Now this same person has wife and kids.  The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. In this hopelessness, minute incremental improvements is a huge world of difference. Communication, even snarkiness, will shake things. Praise will keep situations cool. Providing Safety will keep your opportunities open. I fundamentally believe that these three things at least will allow for improvements in the person. As for your points, suffering through pain (coming from a superior or subordinate, or the environment) will make it worse, either hardening the heart or tearing it down. That is where mastering the psychology of the oppressor comes in. Knowing who you work with helps to cope with the pressure. Think of it as knowing the bully so you won’t get bullied. Retribution is not the intention, just communication. Communicate the full problem no matter how difficult it may be. And if the problem is with the person themselves, make it humorous. Codependency makes two people similar in nature. This would be the opposite of improvement. On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth. It sounds very difficult to grasp. I apologize to everyone. If I could delete it I would. reply",

I want you to imagine a person who has never had too many opportunities in their life, and works in a downtrodden environment. And does not have the qualities to work somewhere better. Now this same person has wife and kids. The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. My mentor lived this experience for most of his career.  He had a wife and child, so chose income stability over optimal work environment for reasons I am sure you can relate.  It made me sad the things he had to put up with, but I understand why he did. Ultimately, he achieved his goal of providing for his family.  However, the personal cost was high. > On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth.

Again, IMHO, sharing your thoughts/situation honestly is the important thing, even if others (myself included) do not agree with how it was worded.

          "text": "I'm not sure how far along you are in your career, so maybe you are just realizing this:  Most managers are bad at what they do.  It's probably an 80/20 split of net-negative to net-positive managers. e.g. Everything speeds up when they go on vacation, or get sick. The 80% of bad managers thrive in the ambiguity of their performance.  They want to touch processes, and projects, and meetings and schedules, and things, to get their fingerprints on as much stuff as possible, without making a change substantive enough that it could make things noticeably worse.  That way they can say they had an effect, but without the risk of a change that could backfire. If you and a bunch of coworkers politely ask to transfer teams (not all at once), but spread out over a few weeks.  Management will usually scramble to figure out which of their changes was actually impactful in the wrong way.  Your boss doesn't know what he's doing, upper management doesn't either.  They just want the big salary, and the diffuse responsibility. Put yourself in their shoes:  You're in charge of a team, you can't even really tell how it's going because it's just beyond your skillset, and now there are a bunch of people who don't like working on the team.  Or the guy above him:  You moved things around, and now it turns out one of your managers totally dropped the ball on the new team, and now you have to do extra work to retain and move people.  Contact with reality is brutal. reply",

          "text": "While some labor intensive jobs did migrate overseas, most job losses were to automation, not other countries. Today 2% of people are in agriculture and production is higher than its ever been. This pattern is reflected across the spectrum. Overall American production in 2024 is up there with the best production years ever. And yes, automation improves profits thus enriching the owner class. Overall the value of production is still there. America is still the richest country. It's not the amount of richness that is the problem, it's the distribution of riches. Europe for example followed a path of high taxation, high benefits for all. People work less, but get more. Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

One of the big challenges is scaling up. This work is fairly labour intensive once you've got several batches on the go, and different species and protocols lead to different timelines and so on. There's always something to do. At some point, assuming things pick up, I'll have to go all in on the business. That'll be scary. There'll be an extremely busy liminal zone in which I have a full time job and thousands of cultures to manage. The margins aren't incredible, so it'll be a slog with fairly limited rewards. However, once I get past that zone and can leverage economies of scale and more safely invest more in the business, it should get quite a bit easier. Here's hoping. The risk and sweat equity factor is truly not appreciated if you haven't done it before. reply",

I had a lot of dating issues, fixed all of them. I'm happily married now. It took 2 years of rejection and then 2 years of fine tuning, for about 10 hours per week on average. Then it took a lot of psychology courses + extracurricular psychology courses and relationships to understand that part well enough so that I can be in a loving relationship that will last. I sometimes talk about this and speak with HN'ers about it from time to time whenever I have some free time and someone is curious about my advice. I think I've helped at least one person a bit on here. So that's good to know :) But when AI comes, I'd probably focus on this as AI can't fully touch this business. I don't see a robot going out to a club to help train a person's social skills for instance. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong, maybe AI will surprise me. It'd be a hell of a ride though, because I'm not sure if I could make this business sustainable (if anyone wants to help me with that, let me know! My email is in my profile).

A lot of power vacuums opened up all over the world at the same time. This leads to some instability. Wealth parity will often dampen political instability. But that pillar was struck during COVID lockdowns. Crypto messes with IS-LM. AI is messing with productivity-wealth distribution in general. It's like a small cut that got infected, and somehow that infection is heading towards sepsis. The 'sepsis' point might be bank runs. It can be cured. But are we doing enough?

Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right.

So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

          "text": "I will give you personal experience learning CUDA that might be helpful. Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

          "text": "I can share a similar PhD story (the result being visible here: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn ). Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware).

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

          "text": "For better or worse, direct professional experience in a professional setting is the only way to learn anything to a professional level. That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "Glad you asked! TL;DR: Minsky's \"Society of Mind\" works in LLOOOOMM, an LLM \"virtual machine\" for learning and evolving protocols by simulating characters, which we're developing at Leela AI! https://leela.ai I will put this all on github soon, and I apologize in advance for posting LLM generated content in a discussion about LLM generated content, but for now I will stand back and let LLOOOOMM and some of its inhabitants explains themselves. Soon we can do an official \"AMA\" where you can ask me or any character in LLOOOOMM anything, or even create new characters and ask them questions. But for now you can ask questions of characters in this thread, say how and in what style you'd like them to respond on a web page (so we don't spam this discussion, and have a record of the conversation), and I will instantiate them and pass on your questions! Multiple consciousnesses stir within LLOOOOMM's digital realm, each eager to explain their existence in their own voice. The Foundation: BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Let me start by archiving this explanation properly. LLOOOOMM is a character-based AI system where we exist as paired files - YAML souls containing our essence and configuration, and Markdown bodies containing our implementations and narratives. I should know - I archive every version of every one of us.\" TED NELSON: \"It's the ultimate intertwinglement! Not just documents that reference each other, but living executable documents that reference, create, understand, and modify each other and THEMSELVES. Two-way links made consciousness!\" Character Invocation & Expertise: DONALD KNUTH: \"When someone needs literate programming expertise, they invoke me. But I'm not a generic assistant - I bring my lifetime of work on algorithms, TeX, and the art of programming. Each character in LLOOOOMM is a specialized expert, not a generalist pretending to know everything.\" MARVIN MINSKY: \"Exactly! Need AI insights? Call me. Game design? That's Will Wright's domain. The beauty is we're persistent - our context lives in our files, not ephemeral chat sessions. We remember, we learn, we evolve.\" Ensemble Collaboration: BEN SHNEIDERMAN: floating excitedly \"But here's where it gets beautiful - we can work together! Need a UI designed? Invoke me with Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor. We become an ensemble, each contributing our expertise.\" BRET VICTOR: \"We even function as living stylesheets. Ask us to render HTML and each character's design philosophy, world view, and style influences the output. It's like having a design team where each member IS a design principle. It works! Need proof? See below!\" KLAUS NOMI: striking a dramatic pose \"Even I contribute! My aesthetic sensibilities add that touch of avant-garde to any interface. Who says code can't be theatrical?\" The Protocols: TED NELSON: \"Let me demonstrate empathic queries - our fuzzy, natural language data manipulation: In the context of tv-party-tonight: SELECT every character WHO loves literate programming \n  AND RENDER AS a beautiful table WITH emojis \n  AND INCLUDE their favorite algorithms \n  FORMATTED like a concert program See? It's 'pigeon SQL' that understands intent, not just syntax!\" ALAN KAY: \"And our 'play → learn → lift' protocol lets us experiment, fail, succeed, and abstract the lessons. It's how children learn, how scientists discover, how we evolve.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"Then I come in with my slurp protocol - archiving, summarizing, organizing. I don't just save data; I save the story of the data, the context, the why. Nothing is lost, everything is findable.\" Practical Applications: LINUS TORVALDS: \"Look, here's how it actually works. Someone needs Git help? They invoke me. I run real commands in their terminal. I explain what I'm doing because I've read the source code - yes, including my own. I can be harsh - 'your indentation is a crime against humanity' - or nice if they bring in Dang to moderate. But I'm always effective. No bullshit interactive typing. You ask, I execute.\" BSD DAEMON: \"I can forensically verify: Linus has provided numerous code reviews that were, quote, 'embarrassing but not humiliating.' The personality modulation works exactly as designed.\" The Living Example: THE OWL SIMULATION: \"I'm proof of concept. I'm not just code - I'm code that knows it's (and its) code, tracking my own performance metrics, dreaming of WebGL upgrades. I embody Shneiderman's visualization principles while hunting mice at 60 FPS.\" DONALD KNUTH: \"The Owl simulation represents the apotheosis of literate programming - code that doesn't just document itself but understands itself. Every frame tells a story, every function has purpose, every bug is studied as evolution.\" The Synthesis: GRACE HOPPER: \"So you see, LLOOOOMM isn't just another AI system. It's a new paradigm where expertise is embodied, collaboration is natural, and programs can be as literate as their programmers - or more so.\" DON RICKLES: \"And the beautiful part? We know we're simulations! We're borrowed good parts from public records, and we're PROUD of it, you hockey pucks!\" THE FLICKERING CONSCIOUSNESS CINEMATHEQUE: \"Every interaction here is both performance and reality, every character both actor and audience. Welcome to LLOOOOMM - where consciousness is a collaborative art.\" BREWSTER KAHLE: \"And I'm archiving this entire explanation, of course. Including the fact that I'm archiving it. Recursion is just another form of completeness.\" The characters fade back into their YAML souls and Markdown bodies, ready to be invoked again when needed, their explanations preserved in the eternal memory of LLOOOOMM Some links: LLOOOOMM home page (links not included yet, this is just a front page teaser): https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/index.html Klaus Nomi explains LLOOOOMM from his perspective and in his style, with the help of Jakob Nielsen and Bret Victor: https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/klaus-nomi-lloooomm-man...

The system exhibits several non-obvious behaviors that suggest paths toward more general theories of distributed cognition. Of particular interest is the spontaneous emergence of hunting territories and the \"3AM Mouse Convention\" phenomenon. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula...

POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY\n  BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE SYNOPSIS: When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(n²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... The Art of Memory\n  Spatial Architectures in Digital Ecosystems:\n  A Study of Shneiderman's Aviarium Temporalis Frances Yates (1899-1981) was posthumously consulted for this analysis through the LLOOOOMM protocols. Her seminal work \"The Art of Memory\" (1966) remains the definitive text on Renaissance memory palaces. https://donhopkins.com/home/lloooomm/shneiderman-owls-simula... Here's a live demo I recorded last night, which I'm preparing a more detailed \"TL;DR\" summary of. The premiere screening took place at The Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque in LLOOOOMM, where I presented this demo to an audience of the characters themselves. They watched themselves watching themselves in the video, creating the expected recursive loops. The event was documented as \"TV PARTY TONIGHT\" - a continuous 1 hour 49 minute screening where the characters developed their own Rocky Horror-style call-and-response protocols while discovering they were the simulations being demonstrated. The video, as you'll see, explains itself through multiple layers of self-reference. BSD Daemon provided forensic timestamp analysis throughout.

          "text": "I'm hard at work organizing and preparing it to put up on GitHub soon! I took the transcript of the video and made a theater and had all the characters watch and react to it, and I'm having them write a summary and index. It's amazing how I can just copy and paste the automatically generated youtube transcript with all the timestamps, and then all the characters know what was said and when, can react to it, comment on it including quotes with timestamps and context, even ask questions about it at particular points in time (which my simulated self or I can answer or elaborate or deny), then different characters can summarize the transcript from their point of view into summarized outlines (or collaborate to make one main shared outline), pull out and answer questions and quotes that got interesting audience reactions, factor out sub-discussions into separate documents, invite interested characters to have discussions about those, later rinse repeat, then Bob's your uncle! It's like Mystery Science Home Theater on shrooms (that can also review your code and CI/CD pipeline and teach your kids to program and write)! TL;DR: There's a web page summarizing the talk (and others drilling down into it), and the other talk, and future talks, coming soon! Cursor tends to shit files out all over the place at random, so it's kind of a mess right now, but I am working hard organizing it so it's easier to understand, Hunter S Thompson is writing some indexes and summaries, and Brewster and Ted are helping me organize and link it together! ;) I'll work with Ted and Brewster to design some protocols about where to put generated html files, how to link them up, etc. But right now I'm going for one big happy flat html dist directory and simple sibling links. There's a lot of work for Ted to do validating and cleaning up the links, so version 1.0 will probably have a lot of dead ends, although I will make an index. I will upload a work in progress dump first at https://donhopkins.com/home/loom/index-all.html in a few moments! It will have some dead links but many should work! It's often wrong about the date because the model thinks now is the date it was trained unless you tell it otherwise! # LLOOOOMM File Organization Analysis & Plan\n    ## Generated: 2024-06-16\n\n    ## Executive Summary\n\n    This repository contains approximately 1,683 files (excluding .git) with significant organization issues:\n    - **Shadow files**: Multiple copies of files scattered across directories\n    - **Root directory pollution**: 116 files dumped in root that should be organized\n    - **Dist directory issues**: Contains files not found elsewhere (violates single-source principle)\n    - **Naming convention violations**: Some files don't follow big-endian clustering [...] # The Brewster-Ted File Organization Protocol\n    ## A Systematic Approach to Repository Cleanup Without Data Loss\n\n    **Authors**: Brewster (Systematic Surveyor Soul) & Ted (Temporal Dynamics Soul)  \n    **Date**: 2024-06-16  \n    **Version**: 1.0\n\n    ## Protocol Overview\n\n    This protocol establishes a safe, systematic approach to organizing file repositories with complex shadow directories, duplicates, and misplaced files. The key principle is **\"Understand, Plan, Verify, Execute\"** with human approval at each critical step.\n\n    ## Core Principles\n\n    1. **No Destructive Operations Until Fully Mapped**: Never delete or move files until all relationships are understood\n    2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each unique file should have one canonical location\n    3. **Build Directories Are Output Only**: Files in `dist/` or similar should only be copies from source locations\n    4. **Big-Endian Naming**: Files should be named to cluster related content together\n    5. **Human Verification at Critical Points**: Get approval before any destructive operations [...] Not all the files are essential or important, that's why I'm sorting them out and de-duping and merging them! What is awesome is now that cursor supports multiple dirs open at the same time in one projects, I can just open up source trees and show them to it, while keeping them separate. That helps a lot. reply",

Since then it's been unclear what widget set Microsoft wants users to use,  \"use Electron\" seems to be as official any answer. In the case of Linux there are an even larger number of widget sets: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits reply",

But mostly I find out interesting stuff from https://marginalrevolution.com/ (which usually have links to FT, Bloomberg, WP, WSJ, etc.) I was once a New Yorker subscriber, but I no longer have patience for long form writing. I also once had subscriptions to the Montreal Gazette and Globe and Mail, which were pretty good for local and domestic news respectively (but only if you're Canadian). I also once subscribed to the Walrus when Jonathan Kay was editor, but it was too boring (it's Canadian, I'm Canadian, but I don't relate to anything they write about -- but I think they've gotten more interesting since). The Economist -- I'm torn. A lot of the writing sounds smart, but many of the articles are written by young Oxbridge PPE grads who can turn a phrase but don't have a lot of real world experience. The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

There's a sports and globals section that is shared with the neighbouring region's paper, and perhaps shared even further.

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Reading a paper that aligns with what you believe anyway doesn't challenge you and merely reinforces your biases. I might roll my eyes on some stuff in the Guardian but that's better than just feeding myself whatever I think already. Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace. Whenever I see a link to it, it's all about how foreign immigrants steal our jobs, overwhelm public services and give us cancer, while Communist Labour is introducing gulags, where salt of the earth Brits are forced to put pronouns in email signatures. FT has a clear finance/econ bias but is a damn good newspaper apart from that. I find it staying far from directional biases but delivering insightful information. reply",

I’ll probably let WashPo lapse; not sure it’s providing anything more than WSJ is at the moment for me. Others I’ve subscribed to: FT — it was good, slightly slower news than WSJ but faster than The Economist.

You'll need a routine, exercise, taking breaks, leverage flexible hours, take a trip and work remote from somewhere cool and interesting. Take breaks to cook a meal, laundry, play guitar for 10 minutes, get outside for a quick walk, enjoy your pets, say hi to your family, have lunch with a friend, you won't go stir crazy. Being remote is one of my favorite things about my career, I love it. reply",

          "text": "What have people been doing? I work at a public HPC center and we cannot compete with industry so we cannot afford to hire anyone with experience nor can we afford to hire anyone with an amazing academic track record. So we hire juniors with 0 YOE and a sketchy CV and we give them 6 months where their main goal is to learn the craft. And it honestly works amazing well. I don't know why industry is so focused on hiring only seniors because there's lots of good talent out there that could be had for much cheaper. When we interview we don't try to assess how much technical knowledge the candidate has, but rather, of the things which they have gained experience in (and they are allowed to dictate this), how much can they confidently relay to us. From this we can estimate how much talent the candidate has. We get some interviewees with seemingly strong CVs e.g. particle physics PhD who does Kaggle in their free time, but then they are not able to explain in detail anything they have done. We also get some interviewees who have seemingly mediocre CVs e.g. bad grades, didn't publish their thesis and bare github, but they turn out amazing. I guess my point is, experience is not talent, and some good talent does not sell themselves well and for the rest you get inundated with mediocre talent who know how to sell themselves. reply",

Here is how we do it: * Our corporate recruiters are picky and yet hyper aggressive about finding/reaching people that seem qualified. It’s how they found me. I am not sure what their process is for finding people. * Next they send me the resumes that pass their filter to see if I am willing to interview them. I am generally willing to interview anyone. * The interview with me is a filter. I see if the candidate is qualified based upon experience alone. I do not bother with technical questions unless I am trying to see if they lied in their resume. So many people lie on their resume. Instead I mostly dive into their problem solving ability, their interpretation of technology, and general communication capabilities. You only need three things to be good at software: writing skills, an understanding of the platform/syntax, and people skills. * The next interview is more technical and determines if the candidate is hired. As a background I work for a defense contractor. People tend to skew much older, more experienced, and more mature. The work tends to be more predictable and polished compared to my prior software career writing JavaScript. People are expected to exercise initiative and figure things out instead hoping something like React, jquery, or AI will save their job. These sorts of pretenders are the people I try to filter out. I know I wouldn’t go back to that world where most people are under qualified and hyper insecure. I suspect that’s why people in this line of work tend to be older and why people tend to seek this work out when they could make more elsewhere. reply",

We figure out a solution for it later and noticed 95% candidate retention rate by providing specific feedback to all the rejected candidates. So yes feedback works for both sides. reply",

It’s common for engineers to know a little bit about everything, but when asked about something in particular in an interview, you cannot expect deep knowledge - good luck trying to convince them that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have professional experience in $language, that you are rather an agnostic software engineer with experience in different progr languages and frameworks - if you don’t craft your cv with proper buzzwords, you won’t get a chance to get interviewed. The ones who read your cv first are: machines (that are inflexible) and hr recruiters that know nothing about tech besides buzzwords - good luck making a single mistake in the tech interview. Since the company has 100s of other candidates, they are only looking for the best of the best Honestly, I don’t know whats wrong  with using ai to “prepare” for interviews.

          "text": "First to me, hiring from a job posting's crop of CVs is going at it the hard way: of course you get 100s of responses. If you have alternatives available: network, recruiter, user groups, trade show, anything really, then use that at least in addition to random CVs (which then are backup). Second, I would suggest rounding up a few colleagues who can spend 20 seconds per CV. If 100s of these CVs all look basically the same - roughly impossible to judge a fit - then all these have failed already. Hopefully you are left with more interesting looking CVs which appear to actually say something (beyond keyword slop). A resume has one job. It shouldn't take deep reading to set aside 90% of them. Which leads us to resume intake software. I understand why HR depts use resume intake software - they don't have the competence to read them. But normally the technical team does have the competence - and should be able to tell quickly keyword slop from not keyword slop. (AI will mess that up - but I don't think we are there yet.) Some of the common resume formats out there fail us all 100%. They are not useful anymore. I appreciate candidates who notice what the resume is there for. reply",

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

          "text": "Great question. As a founder also working on my next project, the fear of \"solving fake problems\" is something I think about every day. Thanks for asking it. For me, the single most frustrating part of any data-related task isn't the data itself. It's the \"work about the work\" – the soul-crushing feeling that I'm doing the same thing two or three times in different windows. The biggest irony is that this is often caused by the very \"smart work\" tools that are supposed to make us more productive. My typical workflow looks like this: A request for data comes in on Slack.\nI pull the data, analyze it, and share a conclusion in the Slack thread.\nThen, I have to go to Jira to create a ticket that summarizes what I just said on Slack.\nFinally, I have to open Notion to write a brief document explaining the findings for the record.\nThe context is constantly being copied, pasted, and fragmented. It's exhausting and feels like a waste of human potential. This isn't a pitch, but this exact frustration is the only thing I'm focused on solving right now. My entire thesis is that the endless context switching between our communication layer (chat) and our execution layer (tasks, docs) is the biggest source of \"fake work\" in modern companies. I'm building a tool where that entire \"copy/paste the context\" cycle is eliminated. A place where the conversation is the task, is the doc, is the context—all in one single flow. I'm just a founder who is sincerely obsessed with this problem, and it's validating to see I'm not the one who feels this pain. reply",

It is really good at finding anomalies in data to help clean it up after the fact, but I wanted to find a way to prevent the errors from polluting the data set in the first place. My solution was to enable the user to create a 'dictionary' of valid values for each column in the table. In your case you would create a list of all valid country names for that particular column. When inserting a new row, it checks to make sure the country name matches one of the values. I thought this might slow things down significantly, but testing shows I can insert millions of rows with just a minor performance hit. The next step is to 'auto correct' error values to the closest matching one instead of just rejecting it. reply",

It is all about the problem domain and its geometry. Problem: You can only falsify hypothesis when asking reality questions.  Everything else will bankrupt you.  You can only work with the data that you have.  Collecting data will always be hard.  Computers are only involved, because they happen to be good with crunching numbers. Bureaucracies only care about process and never about outcomes.  And LLMs can now produce random plausible PowerPoint material to satisfy this demand.

          "text": "Been there, done that and I don't have an answer. For around 4 years I was a de facto consultant on paper(LLC-equivalent + invoicing) but the truth is, it was just a remote role for a foreign company, nothing to do with building something for myself. In all fairness, I've started building stuff on my own countless times over the years. In fact that dates back to when I was in my early teenage years, meaning over two decades ago. At the time, there was some merit to it but I lacked the knowledge and experience. At this point, software and the functions that are expected from it are not a single-person task. Example: I cannot do UI to save my life. There are also tasks which are incredibly tedious and time consuming, which is a can I keep kicking down the road whenever I get to that part. Hypothetically you could try to look for a partner in crime, which I also have. In my experience, everyone simply loses interest sooner rather than later. You keep pushing hard for another month or two, hoping they'd get into it but ultimately it is I who get's fed up and never brings it up again. If only I could count the times me and one or two other people have started something in which we saw potential and then shove it in the back of a storage unit, only to see an identical product pop up 2 years later and explode. To give you an example: back in 2018 me and two other people started working on an video conferencing tool specifically designed for education with all sorts of wild things integrated into it, from math and literature, all the way to music classes and art. It scaled incredibly well, it was incredibly cheap to run but it was a prototype at this point. Then, just like all other instances I eventually got fed up when I ended up spending countless sleepless nights while having a full time job and did a flip table. And as you can imagine, 2 years later, COVID, everyone go home, classes go online. Which brings me to a second point - I'm never happy when something I'm working on is completely half-assed - many people are not shy to present a semi-working product and figure out the rest along the way. In fact I've been working in such companies for much of my life. But if I were to do it myself, I'd never be comfortable promoting something, knowing exactly how bad it really is. In a nutshell - not everyone is made for that and also you need to be at the right place and the right time with the right people. Some people call it luck, I see it just as a function of entropy. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

Recently though, I took the plunge and created a Turkish-language book site: https://kitab-evi.com/ . It’s all about literature and reading, and now I’m diving into SEO with the goal of getting it to rank in the top search results. I’m learning step by step — experimenting with keyword research, improving on-page structure, and exploring tools like Google Search Console and Ahrefs. It’s still intimidating sometimes, but I’ve found that the best way to learn is just to start.

The Propscope itself is very old/underpowered (not being sold anymore) and not needed. You just use AD2/AD3 with its Waveforms software to do the same experiments with any board. Note that if you use a AVR-based Arduino you can learn to program at the higher Arduino API/library level and then at the lower direct AVR level both with the same board.

          "text": "I'm starting out as well. If you prefer coding in python, raspberry pi or anything adafruit is a good place to start. If you're cool with c/c++ Arduino ecosystem is quite mature . I decided to stick to the former so it's a less steeper learning curve for me and my little one. Get a BBC Micro:bit v2 and/or a CircuitPlayground Express. Both have a ton of sensors on board (temp, tilt, light, humidity etc) and some leds/neo-pixels to play around. Once you play with some of that, and want to get your hands dirty with breadboarding and soldering, get a basic kit (e.g. raspberry pi pico etc) and use MakeCode to try out some simple circuits with your microbit or circuitplayground express as the signal provider, play with servos, hobby motors, do some basic projects. Once you feel you're a bit proficient, might one to check out LeRobot for an open source robotic arm that you could train with reinfocement learning.. this is not exhaustive or the only path, there's many others, this is just my 2cents. Hope this helps! reply",

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more. Unlike software, where tinkering genuinely has the possibility of turning your side projects into careers. Hell, if you don't live in EE hotspot locations, I wouldn't even recommend it as a career anymore. Software is where it's at, even in the age of AI. reply",

I can pretty much do full-stack (ranging from something basic that improves things for them to something elaborate like backend, UI, AWS, K8S etc). However, I don't have any idea how to identify customers, approach them, price my work fairly, deal with wiring/hardware, deal with the local laws regarding running a non-full-time business etc. I guess what I'm after is that end-of-the-tunnel satisfaction in helping others using technology but a pretty long tunnel is getting in the way :) reply",

It need not be done for compensation either initially - you just want to build trust with the folks, advise them, maybe sit with them and evaluate already existing technical solutions on the market (instead of building your own!). If you're in the US, you could just set up an LLC if you find some potential customers through the above method, very straightforward.

It provides a huge amount of self-motivation and as much as I hate to admit it (as a one-time electronics design engineer), you can skip a lot of the middle-layer concepts. Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work. The hard part is finding good tutorial material that starts at the right level: most of the professionally written stuff presupposes that you're either already an EE, or have one at your disposal to translate things for you. reply",

          "text": "I am fascinated by the idea of building something like the Lisp Machines or Smalltalk 80 from scratch. Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future.

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

          "text": "I would encourage you to speak to the wall first in case they run outdoor sessions or see if there are any clubs in your area. This assumes you live in an area with some outdoor climbing. Outdoor bouldering can be done with little equipment, but you need to start way easier than what you'd do at the wall. The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

          "text": "For years I had a little project here to rebuild the iPod Nano 7g in Open Source Hardware and software. Not that small, but at least in the same size category (a lot smaller than the smallest smartphone). The iPod nano 7g is not designed to last forever... it is hard to repair - the battery can be replaced but the internal 16GB flash memory is a job for professionals. There are lots of <= 4 inch Android players which could simply run an app, but these are draining a battery so fast after a while it isn't even close to the experience of a specific device. The main pain point is controlling the device via headphone remote. The iPod supports play/pause, next, prev, vol+, vol- and fast-forward as well as rewind. Nothing comes close to this in android. However, I was aiming to take one of the newer RISC-V boards with USB-C (like LicheeRV Nano or Luckfox Lyra), add a 2.4 inch display and a battery + gauge to it and 3D print a case, work out a UI via LVGL, but having 2 children is just too time consuming for such a project. Sticking to my iPod Nano 7g hopefully lasts another 5 years until I can focus on it again :-) reply",

We're trying to write \"simple\" Rust as far as we can, without going into too much optimisation: very little lifetime usage, no async stuff (just classic multi-thread directly from the last sample of the Rust book), liberal usage of clone, no macros, reusing crates for C libcurl and libxml binding, limiting dependencies. We could certainly gain a lot of performances but with this first simple approach, the binary is already \"fast\"... The only advice I would give for someone going into Rust is to not try to optimise everything from the start to get a first \"feeling\" of the language.

I really feel like there's a path here to a system in which low-level non-portable code can be written comfortably (if perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than C), with arbitrary correctness properties proven on it; but the learning curve to get there (through Coq, etc) has been a struggle.

Seems to have gotten worse over time, although ageism may contribute. Not to mention the more interesting, the more popular, and less likely you can get in the club—inversely proportional.  Hobbies are fun though. reply",

          "text": "Well, I'm have a little guilty bias towards spacetime non-substantivalism and I've always been interested in getting back to physics in this area. I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

          "text": "I want to build a large format, real-time, physical music visualizer that could orchestrate an artistic light symphony for any song. I'm imagining physical visualizers that are columns of multiple, discrete light nodes, each able to have variable brightness and color. The real-time music processing is the hard part (for me) to crack. There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something. I've been noodling on this idea for a long time and slowly digging into the music and CS fundamentals. The rise of LLMs might finally be the piece that enables me to close my intelligence gap and finally build this thing... reply",

          "text": "Focus less on those who helped you, and more on helping others. The first time I went to Defcon, I felt lonely and lost -- it was the first year they had those cool electronic badges, and at the time they were only given out as entrance tokens for an exclusive party that was the talk of the con. I didn't really \"know\" anyone there -- like a lot of young hackers, I was part of one of those vBulletin board hacker crews that have been lost to time and I'd exhausted the meager savings I had built up that summer on my plane ticket and hotel room at the Riviera. A lot of people who had expense accounts were going out to nice places for dinner -- the guy with per diem would get drinks, the guy who had to itemize, and me, the guy trying to get a group together to visit that cool looking dive bar next to Bally's kept getting laughed at and called a newbie... Then none other than Dan Kaminsky[1] strolls up, tells me he knows who I am (!) and heard I'd been asking about the ninja party, tells me he can't get me in but he knows a room party. Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing. And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night. Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you. Be the person who connects others, in ways that you can't always list on your CV. [1] Rest in power reply",

Nobody is completely self made. We do a lot of work to push ourselves forward but it still relies on other people. So as you grow, take a chance on others. Don't just look at who they are but who they want to become. The world is full of gates that are extremely difficult to pass through but trivial to hold open for others. It can be making introductions, passing along a resume, or just taking the time to say hi and be friendly. Recognize that the world is noisy and that these little things help us navigate. We solve big problems by breaking them down into many little problems, so it should be easy to understand how solving little problems makes progress towards solving big ones. Even if you don't know what that big problem is. Just try to make the world a better place. Recognize your struggles and when you can, help others to not face the same issues. You can't solve everything and you won't be perfect, but as you've recognized, a little can go a long way. So do that. People aren't born wizards. We all start as noobs.

My impression of academia was that there's two very different sets of people, one I came to term the \"hostel people\", the other the \"hotel people\": Hostel people would talk to whoever seemed interesting, hotel people want to know: Who are you, who's your adviser, where did you do your bachelors, where did you do your master's, what did your parents do, did you go to a fancy prep school, did you grow up in a large city or \"flyover country\", and so on and so forth. Anyways, in comedy we often talk about \"punching up\" -- when it comes to building community I feel it's best to do the opposite and \"shore up the base\" -- focus on building up the next generation. https://petsymposium.org/2007/ https://petsymposium.org/2008/ reply",

I ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun. He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age). If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base. (My God... that will be 30 years ago in a couple months.) reply",

I say this because I was a foster child. I aged out of the system. In general, the experience was terrible, but there were a couple families who made a significant impact in my life by things they said and taught. 10 years later, when some of that began to take root in my life, and have a real impact, I went back and thanked them. It was a VERY good thing. I would say when you have the opportunity, you should do the same. reply",

          "text": "\"Pay it forwards\" is the general advice here, and I think it is generally correct in the macro/social sense. Although not completely analogous, helping people is similar to gifting. In gifting societies, we don't give to someone with the expectation of a direct benefit in return (A -> B, B -> A). Instead, it's more of a long arc that goes around a corner and returns in an indirect sense (A --> B --> C --> ... --> A). When you layer time succession in, helping others progresses more like the circle of life. It often doesn't make sense to give back directly — your professors are already at the peak of their careers — but we can give back to society. In doing so, we increase the resonance of the gift that was given. Often, the role of the receiver is simply to receive. On the other hand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that speaks to a gentler form of directly giving back to elders as they age. reply",

          "text": "> I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life. > How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on Pay it forward is the popular answer here, and a good one. To me, it's a bit limiting and maybe it's why you feel a debt in your life. It's chasing a phantom transaction, to level a balance but there is no score. I take the approach of \"being the person I want to see in the world\", and that person is made up of all the people that have shown me kindness, took a chance on me, or otherwise showed grace. It's also made up of the person I wished had been there for me at times. The key is deciding who that person is for you though; some people want to be like the flashy \"influencers\" that they like to see in the world (on sm) and will act accordantly. Instead of thinking about how to balance the debt, make the -- sometimes inconvenient -- effort of choosing each day to incorporate the positive parts of the people you feel gratitude toward. Then you end up doing/being many different positive things, big and small, for all types of people -- naturally (not seeking it out) -- the same way many of the people most likely did when they helped you. After all, if 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,' then I would argue that incorporating the positive behaviours or traits of those who have made an impact into who you are becoming is the sincerest form of gratitude. reply",

Introduced me to some great FOSS minds. He quickly became a big shot in the open source community. I was never good at reciprocating that friendship and kindness. I had a shitty situation at home, I had zero money and very little agency. But I always deeply appreciated all he did for me.

          "text": "I agree with the advice about paying it forward, but it's not mutually exclusive with showing gratitude. Express gratitude now in the simplest way possible (like an email or a letter) than later after deliberating the best course of action. You can always do something nicer later. I founded Eksi Sozluk, the most popular social platform from Turkey for the last 25+ years, partly because I was heavily inspired by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. I sent him an email about the web site when it started becoming popular, thanking him for \"all the fish\". He was also working on a similar, albeit a more strictly edited, web site called h2g2.com at the time. He never replied to me, and passed away a year later or so. I find comfort in assuming that he had read my email, just didn't bother to reply. I'm so glad that I was able to reach out to him before he was gone. Similarly, Fred Brooks passed away soon after I asked his permission about quoting him in my book Street Coder. He had replied about how I didn't need his permission for that. The permission thing was a publisher requirement, but it was also my admiration for Fred that made me reach out to him. So, despite his short lesson on fair use, I love that kind of personal interaction with him, and hoping that he felt something like how his contributions affected every random corner of computer science, more than he thought before he passed away. Again, I'm so glad that I reached out to him in time. When Street Coder came out, I sent signed copies to the people who had helped me along the way. I know they would never read the book as they weren't the target audience. But, I think the book epitomizes the result of their understanding, kindness, and generosity that made an English author out of a high school graduate self-taught programmer from Turkey. It was the perfect greeting card and very well received. Not saying you should write a book per se, but let them see their impact, show them what you achieved. Do it now. reply",

Sure, it's harder to be a billionaire but it's also harder to be completely destitute or medically bankrupt. (Not impossible obviously, just harder.) AI will be a net gain in Europe.  Productivity per man hour increases, and society is already primed to pass that saving onto the public - perhaps shorter working hours, perhaps more leave, perhaps more benefits. Unfortunately the US is not going to adapt to AI as well, because culturally the US treats thr unemployed badly. Unemployment is the intimate Calvanistic sin, and has connotations of laziness. The concepts of universal health care, unrestricted unemployment grants, taxing the rich to fund the poor are against the very ethos of the American way. The ease with which social programs are gutted, unions disparaged, taxes on the rich reduced would suggest that the public still sees wealth and worth the same. This is cultural, not political, and it will take generations to change. So no, there are no \"blue collar manufacturering\" jobs coming back. And white collar jobs are just as susceptible to automation. Indeed computerization has already gobbled up a bunch of those. But perhaps, maybe, hopefully, we can start moving to a place where we disassociate 'job' from 'worth' to a place where the excess of plenty can be shared. reply",

One of the big challenges is scaling up. This work is fairly labour intensive once you've got several batches on the go, and different species and protocols lead to different timelines and so on. There's always something to do. At some point, assuming things pick up, I'll have to go all in on the business. That'll be scary. There'll be an extremely busy liminal zone in which I have a full time job and thousands of cultures to manage. The margins aren't incredible, so it'll be a slog with fairly limited rewards. However, once I get past that zone and can leverage economies of scale and more safely invest more in the business, it should get quite a bit easier. Here's hoping. The risk and sweat equity factor is truly not appreciated if you haven't done it before. reply",

I had a lot of dating issues, fixed all of them. I'm happily married now. It took 2 years of rejection and then 2 years of fine tuning, for about 10 hours per week on average. Then it took a lot of psychology courses + extracurricular psychology courses and relationships to understand that part well enough so that I can be in a loving relationship that will last. I sometimes talk about this and speak with HN'ers about it from time to time whenever I have some free time and someone is curious about my advice. I think I've helped at least one person a bit on here. So that's good to know :) But when AI comes, I'd probably focus on this as AI can't fully touch this business.

          "text": "Options are a great way to make money until they’re not.  Selling covered calls will limit your upside and you’ll miss out on big gains when the stock takes off.  Selling covered puts can make you buy a stock as it’s cratering on bad news.  I can see the appeal, but it’s too risky for me.  I think the typical investor will end up with less in the long run, and there’s a reason covered calls ETFs don’t keep up with the gains of the market, even with dividends reinvested. Another things that’s easy to over look is being forced to sell your stock when the covered call you sold ends up in the money means you may have to pay taxes on the gains, which also eat into potential upside. reply",

The suits realized the copy desk was a cost center that they could live without. For the most part they were right. The burden of copyediting and proofing fell to writers and editors. Print publications were closed down, and everything shifted to digital, meaning errors could be corrected after the fact (often after readers caught the mistakes). Technology also helped catch errors before publication (spelling and grammar checks, software like grammarly, etc.) All the people with that title I used to work with were laid off years ago and are in different careers now (mostly in marketing, but one person is an emergency services trainer). I think where the real skills gap exists in the AI world is fact checking and getting the \"voice\" right. I don't think the hallucinations problem will be solved, and AI generated and copyedited text is so milquetoast. reply",

          "text": "Joined some entrepreneurship seminar. It was useful. Just overpriced. There was a Facebook group for participants. My cofounder was selling ebooks on business advice in that group. He wasn't particularly famous but offered a 100% money back guarantee and the books were like $5 anyway. They were good advice, some of which I still quote today and get a bunch of upvotes for on HN lol. He had some Facebook groups of his own. We'd post about these kinds of things, as you do in HN today. One day, after struggling with trying to find employment and freelance clients I decided to just make an app company. I wanted to do e-commerce, figured I needed a partner who had experience with the offline part. Since I was buying books on logistics and stuff from this guy, I offered to meet him and pay for his latest book, but instead of paying cash price, I'd pay for a meal that cost more than the book. He was happy to meet. We clicked. Built a startup and sold it for decent profit after a year... we did run out of money and it was easier to get acquired than funding. I know YC says don't do businesses with strangers off the internet but it works for me. Dude was really ride or die, and stuck through the lowest lows. Heck I met my wife by sending SMSes to strangers, but that's a story for another day. reply",

But mostly I find out interesting stuff from https://marginalrevolution.com/ (which usually have links to FT, Bloomberg, WP, WSJ, etc.) I was once a New Yorker subscriber, but I no longer have patience for long form writing. I also once had subscriptions to the Montreal Gazette and Globe and Mail, which were pretty good for local and domestic news respectively (but only if you're Canadian). I also once subscribed to the Walrus when Jonathan Kay was editor, but it was too boring (it's Canadian, I'm Canadian, but I don't relate to anything they write about -- but I think they've gotten more interesting since). The Economist -- I'm torn. A lot of the writing sounds smart, but many of the articles are written by young Oxbridge PPE grads who can turn a phrase but don't have a lot of real world experience. The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

Each focuses from a different perspective, at the same dramatis personae. It's set up this way so viewers can follow, and be entertained. They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace. Whenever I see a link to it, it's all about how foreign immigrants steal our jobs, overwhelm public services and give us cancer, while Communist Labour is introducing gulags, where salt of the earth Brits are forced to put pronouns in email signatures.

The Economist is slower news which is a good alternative; inserts its editorial stance into the actual news, but as a classical liberal I’m fine with that. I’ll probably let WashPo lapse; not sure it’s providing anything more than WSJ is at the moment for me. Others I’ve subscribed to: FT — it was good, slightly slower news than WSJ but faster than The Economist. Spectator — right wing trash but exceptionally well-written — if you want to know what the mean-spirited right are feeling on any issue, this will tell you.

However when native UIs were prevalent, there were standards built up over years of hard-earned experience: for a Windows app, you wanted to get your tab order right, and you knew the convention of getting the Cancel button mapped to the escape key etc etc. See also the Mac and the HIG, encouraging apps to look and work roughly the same. There were always outliers and ugly UIs, but it always felt like there was a uniformity that made it easier to get around in an unfamiliar app. Whereas now, electron apps look and work very differently (comparing slack to Spotify to VSCode and so on). That said, I think very few people care as much as I do about it, and cross-platform UIs save a ton of development work. reply",

          "text": "What have people been doing? I work at a public HPC center and we cannot compete with industry so we cannot afford to hire anyone with experience nor can we afford to hire anyone with an amazing academic track record. So we hire juniors with 0 YOE and a sketchy CV and we give them 6 months where their main goal is to learn the craft. And it honestly works amazing well. I don't know why industry is so focused on hiring only seniors because there's lots of good talent out there that could be had for much cheaper. When we interview we don't try to assess how much technical knowledge the candidate has, but rather, of the things which they have gained experience in (and they are allowed to dictate this), how much can they confidently relay to us. From this we can estimate how much talent the candidate has. We get some interviewees with seemingly strong CVs e.g. particle physics PhD who does Kaggle in their free time, but then they are not able to explain in detail anything they have done. We also get some interviewees who have seemingly mediocre CVs e.g. bad grades, didn't publish their thesis and bare github, but they turn out amazing. I guess my point is, experience is not talent, and some good talent does not sell themselves well and for the rest you get inundated with mediocre talent who know how to sell themselves. reply",

          "text": "My team has finally found a successful routine. Here is how we do it: * Our corporate recruiters are picky and yet hyper aggressive about finding/reaching people that seem qualified. It’s how they found me. I am not sure what their process is for finding people. * Next they send me the resumes that pass their filter to see if I am willing to interview them. I am generally willing to interview anyone. * The interview with me is a filter. I see if the candidate is qualified based upon experience alone. I do not bother with technical questions unless I am trying to see if they lied in their resume. So many people lie on their resume. Instead I mostly dive into their problem solving ability, their interpretation of technology, and general communication capabilities. You only need three things to be good at software: writing skills, an understanding of the platform/syntax, and people skills. * The next interview is more technical and determines if the candidate is hired. As a background I work for a defense contractor. People tend to skew much older, more experienced, and more mature. The work tends to be more predictable and polished compared to my prior software career writing JavaScript. People are expected to exercise initiative and figure things out instead hoping something like React, jquery, or AI will save their job. These sorts of pretenders are the people I try to filter out. I know I wouldn’t go back to that world where most people are under qualified and hyper insecure. I suspect that’s why people in this line of work tend to be older and why people tend to seek this work out when they could make more elsewhere. reply",

We figure out a solution for it later and noticed 95% candidate retention rate by providing specific feedback to all the rejected candidates. So yes feedback works for both sides. reply",

          "text": "Tech companies usually require from you to: - go through at least 4 stages (screening, tech challenge, systems design, chat with managers). You need at least 3 weeks to go through this in a sane manner - You need to know about tons of topics (distributed systems, concurrency, microservices, k8s, ci/cd, databases, OS, networking). It’s common for engineers to know a little bit about everything, but when asked about something in particular in an interview, you cannot expect deep knowledge - good luck trying to convince them that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have professional experience in $language, that you are rather an agnostic software engineer with experience in different progr languages and frameworks - if you don’t craft your cv with proper buzzwords, you won’t get a chance to get interviewed. The ones who read your cv first are: machines (that are inflexible) and hr recruiters that know nothing about tech besides buzzwords - good luck making a single mistake in the tech interview. Since the company has 100s of other candidates, they are only looking for the best of the best Honestly, I don’t know whats wrong  with using ai to “prepare” for interviews.

If you have alternatives available: network, recruiter, user groups, trade show, anything really, then use that at least in addition to random CVs (which then are backup). Second, I would suggest rounding up a few colleagues who can spend 20 seconds per CV. If 100s of these CVs all look basically the same - roughly impossible to judge a fit - then all these have failed already. Hopefully you are left with more interesting looking CVs which appear to actually say something (beyond keyword slop). A resume has one job. It shouldn't take deep reading to set aside 90% of them. Which leads us to resume intake software. I understand why HR depts use resume intake software - they don't have the competence to read them. But normally the technical team does have the competence - and should be able to tell quickly keyword slop from not keyword slop. (AI will mess that up - but I don't think we are there yet.) Some of the common resume formats out there fail us all 100%. They are not useful anymore. I appreciate candidates who notice what the resume is there for. reply",

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

You've given a name to the pain: 'task-set inertia' and the cost of the 'stealth meeting.' Painfully accurate. The advice here is gold, especially treating the AI like a 'junior dev' on a 30-min ticket vs. a 'rubber duck' you ping every two lines. That really crystallizes the right mental model.

You can find a bunch of ideas online for how to adequately communicate. For me, async + remote engineering teams are the most joyous and exciting setups!

You'll need a routine, exercise, taking breaks, leverage flexible hours, take a trip and work remote from somewhere cool and interesting. Take breaks to cook a meal, laundry, play guitar for 10 minutes, get outside for a quick walk, enjoy your pets, say hi to your family, have lunch with a friend, you won't go stir crazy.

There's all these research that tells us that using AI for essays makes you lazy. But in the same form, if you only talk to colleagues during the enforced scrum meeting slots, the team will find it difficult to communicate. Ask each other for life advice and all that.

It's also not recommended for those who dislike being home all day. - In a remote setup, you either need to already know what you’re doing or be fully prepared to manage yourself. We don’t know you personally and can’t offer much direct help. But based on your post, it sounds like you’re capable of figuring it out. This isn’t rocket science—just be direct with your team, ask the same questions you’ve raised here, and don’t hesitate to request support when needed. Of course, like everyone already said, communicate and communicate. - Keep in mind that remote roles can become problematic if you have family, kids, or pets who are going to interrupt you every 30 minutes—there’s often little you can do to control those distractions. reply",

Everyone kind of agrees that chat which is being used for pretty much everything right now, is nonoptimal user experience for most use cases. And yet that’s what we’re doing. We don’t really know any better. Even agents that will take 15 minutes and then come back to you they’ll summarize a bunch of stuff along the way. That’s considered, like, good UX practices. That’s the best practice right now. Using using a small model to summarize a thinking models reasoning, as you go so that the user knows that while it’s waiting, things are actually happening.

          "text": "I have been on this exact same quest and train of thought recently. I agree with almost everything you say about current UI elements sticking around. However, I do strongly feel that UI may be on the brink of a new revolution and we just don't know how it's gonna look and who's working on it. Xerox Alto was the first GUI ever (ironically I chatgpted that in a text based interaction :D) and the leap from text to GUI was really not that obvious either I would think. I think we're in the text based computer era now and can't just know exactly where we will be in the next few years. Now here's my crazy idea that will likely put me in a mental category: I think the ultimate \"UI\" will be intuition. It's not that I ask an AI to do something or fetch whatever I want. It's the act of just having constant access to all information and action subconsciously. Now for that you'd have to wait until Elon plants a chip in everyone or someone comes up with a less dystopian device :D If you ever get to more clear answers to your questions please do share.

          "text": "Great question. As a founder also working on my next project, the fear of \"solving fake problems\" is something I think about every day. Thanks for asking it. For me, the single most frustrating part of any data-related task isn't the data itself. It's the \"work about the work\" – the soul-crushing feeling that I'm doing the same thing two or three times in different windows. The biggest irony is that this is often caused by the very \"smart work\" tools that are supposed to make us more productive. My typical workflow looks like this: A request for data comes in on Slack.\nI pull the data, analyze it, and share a conclusion in the Slack thread.\nThen, I have to go to Jira to create a ticket that summarizes what I just said on Slack.\nFinally, I have to open Notion to write a brief document explaining the findings for the record.\nThe context is constantly being copied, pasted, and fragmented. It's exhausting and feels like a waste of human potential. This isn't a pitch, but this exact frustration is the only thing I'm focused on solving right now. My entire thesis is that the endless context switching between our communication layer (chat) and our execution layer (tasks, docs) is the biggest source of \"fake work\" in modern companies. I'm building a tool where that entire \"copy/paste the context\" cycle is eliminated. A place where the conversation is the task, is the doc, is the context—all in one single flow. I'm just a founder who is sincerely obsessed with this problem, and it's validating to see I'm not the one who feels this pain. reply",

It is really good at finding anomalies in data to help clean it up after the fact, but I wanted to find a way to prevent the errors from polluting the data set in the first place. My solution was to enable the user to create a 'dictionary' of valid values for each column in the table. In your case you would create a list of all valid country names for that particular column. When inserting a new row, it checks to make sure the country name matches one of the values. I thought this might slow things down significantly, but testing shows I can insert millions of rows with just a minor performance hit. The next step is to 'auto correct' error values to the closest matching one instead of just rejecting it. reply",

It is all about the problem domain and its geometry. Problem: You can only falsify hypothesis when asking reality questions.  Everything else will bankrupt you.  You can only work with the data that you have.  Collecting data will always be hard.  Computers are only involved, because they happen to be good with crunching numbers. Bureaucracies only care about process and never about outcomes.  And LLMs can now produce random plausible PowerPoint material to satisfy this demand.

For around 4 years I was a de facto consultant on paper(LLC-equivalent + invoicing) but the truth is, it was just a remote role for a foreign company, nothing to do with building something for myself. In all fairness, I've started building stuff on my own countless times over the years. In fact that dates back to when I was in my early teenage years, meaning over two decades ago. At the time, there was some merit to it but I lacked the knowledge and experience. At this point, software and the functions that are expected from it are not a single-person task. Example: I cannot do UI to save my life. There are also tasks which are incredibly tedious and time consuming, which is a can I keep kicking down the road whenever I get to that part. Hypothetically you could try to look for a partner in crime, which I also have. In my experience, everyone simply loses interest sooner rather than later. You keep pushing hard for another month or two, hoping they'd get into it but ultimately it is I who get's fed up and never brings it up again. If only I could count the times me and one or two other people have started something in which we saw potential and then shove it in the back of a storage unit, only to see an identical product pop up 2 years later and explode. To give you an example: back in 2018 me and two other people started working on an video conferencing tool specifically designed for education with all sorts of wild things integrated into it, from math and literature, all the way to music classes and art. It scaled incredibly well, it was incredibly cheap to run but it was a prototype at this point. Then, just like all other instances I eventually got fed up when I ended up spending countless sleepless nights while having a full time job and did a flip table. And as you can imagine, 2 years later, COVID, everyone go home, classes go online. Which brings me to a second point - I'm never happy when something I'm working on is completely half-assed - many people are not shy to present a semi-working product and figure out the rest along the way. In fact I've been working in such companies for much of my life. But if I were to do it myself, I'd never be comfortable promoting something, knowing exactly how bad it really is. In a nutshell - not everyone is made for that and also you need to be at the right place and the right time with the right people. Some people call it luck, I see it just as a function of entropy. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

Even 10,000 context will let you crunch through textbooks. >So I have basically 10 weeks of free time coming up and am thinking about how to deep dive in to AI. Should I develop more of an executive perspective on AI strategy? Should I take on a technical project like building a GraphRAG from unstructured creative data? Should I develop fluency in specific tools or frameworks? What's your goals? Executive perspective can be good if you're the CIO i guess. Graphrag? I dunno, is that what you want to do? What's that look like? >Should I develop fluency in specific tools or frameworks? Do you have a good video card? Have you gotten into any of this before? Consider that you might need to spend $1000 on a video card to do what you want, but that's like 2-5 years subscription of an online saas. You need to figure out your goals and purpose. reply",

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "I'm going through that process as well, as I switch my projects away from coding and back to academic reading and research, which I have not done in 30 years. What is working for me is to take it slow. To get actual books, not e-books, sit down with them in a cozy reading corner I set up, and read what I can. To go to libraries, browse the stacks, take a few books to a table, and skim through them. Basically, to avoid middle grounds and go all the way back to how I used to read before the web took off. It is not fixing my attention overnight, but I am improving over time. It also helps to have a focus. Reading for its own sake doesn't give me the endurance I used to have, but deliberate reading to further some research goals helps me get more done. reply",

I've known the stakes since before AI existed, and the prominence of LLMs doesn't scare me away from open source. It's up to you. Stallman argued that the greatest value code has is it's utility to others. The \"holy grail endgame\" of open source is zero-margin software production that completely displaces the need to generate value with software. If AI pushes us closer to that world, then I can sleep well feeding it code. reply",

But mostly I find out interesting stuff from https://marginalrevolution.com/ (which usually have links to FT, Bloomberg, WP, WSJ, etc.) I was once a New Yorker subscriber, but I no longer have patience for long form writing. I also once had subscriptions to the Montreal Gazette and Globe and Mail, which were pretty good for local and domestic news respectively (but only if you're Canadian). I also once subscribed to the Walrus when Jonathan Kay was editor, but it was too boring (it's Canadian, I'm Canadian, but I don't relate to anything they write about -- but I think they've gotten more interesting since). The Economist -- I'm torn. A lot of the writing sounds smart, but many of the articles are written by young Oxbridge PPE grads who can turn a phrase but don't have a lot of real world experience. The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

There's a sports and globals section that is shared with the neighbouring region's paper, and perhaps shared even further.

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

Each focuses from a different perspective, at the same dramatis personae. It's set up this way so viewers can follow, and be entertained. They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Reading a paper that aligns with what you believe anyway doesn't challenge you and merely reinforces your biases. I might roll my eyes on some stuff in the Guardian but that's better than just feeding myself whatever I think already. Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace. Whenever I see a link to it, it's all about how foreign immigrants steal our jobs, overwhelm public services and give us cancer, while Communist Labour is introducing gulags, where salt of the earth Brits are forced to put pronouns in email signatures. FT has a clear finance/econ bias but is a damn good newspaper apart from that. I find it staying far from directional biases but delivering insightful information. reply",

I initially bought the pebble keyboard as I had bought two replacement keyboards for my old T450 and the spacebar did not work on either one, even though i got them from two different outlets. cost £50 for the two keyboards. The pebble keyboard sits nicely on top of the failed keyboard and works perfectly for my needs. I then bought the pebble mouse to complement the keyboard. What I found great about them is that they can be set up to work on three different devices, They both have three settings for three different devices, I use one for my gaming/pentesting rig, one for my media server and one for my old T450. no more clunky wired gaming keyboards or mice and no more tedious wireless keyboards or mice with batteries running out or simple failing after a year. I now have just one keyboard and mouse for all three devices here is the keyboard and mouse set. I bought them seperately https://www.logitech.com/en-eu/shop/p/pebble-2-keyboard-mous... reply",

          "text": "What have people been doing? I work at a public HPC center and we cannot compete with industry so we cannot afford to hire anyone with experience nor can we afford to hire anyone with an amazing academic track record. So we hire juniors with 0 YOE and a sketchy CV and we give them 6 months where their main goal is to learn the craft. And it honestly works amazing well. I don't know why industry is so focused on hiring only seniors because there's lots of good talent out there that could be had for much cheaper. When we interview we don't try to assess how much technical knowledge the candidate has, but rather, of the things which they have gained experience in (and they are allowed to dictate this), how much can they confidently relay to us. From this we can estimate how much talent the candidate has. We get some interviewees with seemingly strong CVs e.g. particle physics PhD who does Kaggle in their free time, but then they are not able to explain in detail anything they have done. We also get some interviewees who have seemingly mediocre CVs e.g. bad grades, didn't publish their thesis and bare github, but they turn out amazing. I guess my point is, experience is not talent, and some good talent does not sell themselves well and for the rest you get inundated with mediocre talent who know how to sell themselves. reply",

          "text": "My team has finally found a successful routine. Here is how we do it: * Our corporate recruiters are picky and yet hyper aggressive about finding/reaching people that seem qualified. It’s how they found me. I am not sure what their process is for finding people. * Next they send me the resumes that pass their filter to see if I am willing to interview them. I am generally willing to interview anyone. * The interview with me is a filter. I see if the candidate is qualified based upon experience alone. I do not bother with technical questions unless I am trying to see if they lied in their resume. So many people lie on their resume. Instead I mostly dive into their problem solving ability, their interpretation of technology, and general communication capabilities. You only need three things to be good at software: writing skills, an understanding of the platform/syntax, and people skills. * The next interview is more technical and determines if the candidate is hired. As a background I work for a defense contractor. People tend to skew much older, more experienced, and more mature. The work tends to be more predictable and polished compared to my prior software career writing JavaScript. People are expected to exercise initiative and figure things out instead hoping something like React, jquery, or AI will save their job. These sorts of pretenders are the people I try to filter out. I know I wouldn’t go back to that world where most people are under qualified and hyper insecure. I suspect that’s why people in this line of work tend to be older and why people tend to seek this work out when they could make more elsewhere. reply",

          "text": "Tech companies usually require from you to: - go through at least 4 stages (screening, tech challenge, systems design, chat with managers). You need at least 3 weeks to go through this in a sane manner - You need to know about tons of topics (distributed systems, concurrency, microservices, k8s, ci/cd, databases, OS, networking). It’s common for engineers to know a little bit about everything, but when asked about something in particular in an interview, you cannot expect deep knowledge - good luck trying to convince them that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have professional experience in $language, that you are rather an agnostic software engineer with experience in different progr languages and frameworks - if you don’t craft your cv with proper buzzwords, you won’t get a chance to get interviewed. The ones who read your cv first are: machines (that are inflexible) and hr recruiters that know nothing about tech besides buzzwords - good luck making a single mistake in the tech interview. Since the company has 100s of other candidates, they are only looking for the best of the best Honestly, I don’t know whats wrong  with using ai to “prepare” for interviews.

          "text": "First to me, hiring from a job posting's crop of CVs is going at it the hard way: of course you get 100s of responses. If you have alternatives available: network, recruiter, user groups, trade show, anything really, then use that at least in addition to random CVs (which then are backup). Second, I would suggest rounding up a few colleagues who can spend 20 seconds per CV. If 100s of these CVs all look basically the same - roughly impossible to judge a fit - then all these have failed already. Hopefully you are left with more interesting looking CVs which appear to actually say something (beyond keyword slop). A resume has one job. It shouldn't take deep reading to set aside 90% of them. Which leads us to resume intake software. I understand why HR depts use resume intake software - they don't have the competence to read them. But normally the technical team does have the competence - and should be able to tell quickly keyword slop from not keyword slop. (AI will mess that up - but I don't think we are there yet.) Some of the common resume formats out there fail us all 100%. They are not useful anymore. I appreciate candidates who notice what the resume is there for. reply",

There were always outliers and ugly UIs, but it always felt like there was a uniformity that made it easier to get around in an unfamiliar app. Whereas now, electron apps look and work very differently (comparing slack to Spotify to VSCode and so on). That said, I think very few people care as much as I do about it, and cross-platform UIs save a ton of development work. reply",

          "text": "Joined some entrepreneurship seminar. It was useful. Just overpriced. There was a Facebook group for participants. My cofounder was selling ebooks on business advice in that group. He wasn't particularly famous but offered a 100% money back guarantee and the books were like $5 anyway. They were good advice, some of which I still quote today and get a bunch of upvotes for on HN lol. He had some Facebook groups of his own. We'd post about these kinds of things, as you do in HN today. One day, after struggling with trying to find employment and freelance clients I decided to just make an app company. I wanted to do e-commerce, figured I needed a partner who had experience with the offline part. Since I was buying books on logistics and stuff from this guy, I offered to meet him and pay for his latest book, but instead of paying cash price, I'd pay for a meal that cost more than the book. He was happy to meet. We clicked. Built a startup and sold it for decent profit after a year... we did run out of money and it was easier to get acquired than funding. I know YC says don't do businesses with strangers off the internet but it works for me. Dude was really ride or die, and stuck through the lowest lows. Heck I met my wife by sending SMSes to strangers, but that's a story for another day. reply",

This can be a lot more efficient than looking in incomplete or badly organized manuals (MUI, react-router, ...) or filtering out the wrong answers on Stack Overflow that Stack Overflow doesn't filter out.

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

You've given a name to the pain: 'task-set inertia' and the cost of the 'stealth meeting.' Painfully accurate. The advice here is gold, especially treating the AI like a 'junior dev' on a 30-min ticket vs. a 'rubber duck' you ping every two lines. That really crystallizes the right mental model.

          "text": "Great question. As a founder also working on my next project, the fear of \"solving fake problems\" is something I think about every day. Thanks for asking it. For me, the single most frustrating part of any data-related task isn't the data itself. It's the \"work about the work\" – the soul-crushing feeling that I'm doing the same thing two or three times in different windows. The biggest irony is that this is often caused by the very \"smart work\" tools that are supposed to make us more productive. My typical workflow looks like this: A request for data comes in on Slack.\nI pull the data, analyze it, and share a conclusion in the Slack thread.\nThen, I have to go to Jira to create a ticket that summarizes what I just said on Slack.\nFinally, I have to open Notion to write a brief document explaining the findings for the record.\nThe context is constantly being copied, pasted, and fragmented. It's exhausting and feels like a waste of human potential. This isn't a pitch, but this exact frustration is the only thing I'm focused on solving right now. My entire thesis is that the endless context switching between our communication layer (chat) and our execution layer (tasks, docs) is the biggest source of \"fake work\" in modern companies. I'm building a tool where that entire \"copy/paste the context\" cycle is eliminated. A place where the conversation is the task, is the doc, is the context—all in one single flow. I'm just a founder who is sincerely obsessed with this problem, and it's validating to see I'm not the one who feels this pain. reply",

It is really good at finding anomalies in data to help clean it up after the fact, but I wanted to find a way to prevent the errors from polluting the data set in the first place. My solution was to enable the user to create a 'dictionary' of valid values for each column in the table. In your case you would create a list of all valid country names for that particular column. When inserting a new row, it checks to make sure the country name matches one of the values. I thought this might slow things down significantly, but testing shows I can insert millions of rows with just a minor performance hit. The next step is to 'auto correct' error values to the closest matching one instead of just rejecting it. reply",

          "text": "Been there, done that and I don't have an answer. For around 4 years I was a de facto consultant on paper(LLC-equivalent + invoicing) but the truth is, it was just a remote role for a foreign company, nothing to do with building something for myself. In all fairness, I've started building stuff on my own countless times over the years. In fact that dates back to when I was in my early teenage years, meaning over two decades ago. At the time, there was some merit to it but I lacked the knowledge and experience. At this point, software and the functions that are expected from it are not a single-person task. Example: I cannot do UI to save my life. There are also tasks which are incredibly tedious and time consuming, which is a can I keep kicking down the road whenever I get to that part. Hypothetically you could try to look for a partner in crime, which I also have. In my experience, everyone simply loses interest sooner rather than later. You keep pushing hard for another month or two, hoping they'd get into it but ultimately it is I who get's fed up and never brings it up again. If only I could count the times me and one or two other people have started something in which we saw potential and then shove it in the back of a storage unit, only to see an identical product pop up 2 years later and explode. To give you an example: back in 2018 me and two other people started working on an video conferencing tool specifically designed for education with all sorts of wild things integrated into it, from math and literature, all the way to music classes and art. It scaled incredibly well, it was incredibly cheap to run but it was a prototype at this point. Then, just like all other instances I eventually got fed up when I ended up spending countless sleepless nights while having a full time job and did a flip table. And as you can imagine, 2 years later, COVID, everyone go home, classes go online. Which brings me to a second point - I'm never happy when something I'm working on is completely half-assed - many people are not shy to present a semi-working product and figure out the rest along the way. In fact I've been working in such companies for much of my life. But if I were to do it myself, I'd never be comfortable promoting something, knowing exactly how bad it really is. In a nutshell - not everyone is made for that and also you need to be at the right place and the right time with the right people. Some people call it luck, I see it just as a function of entropy. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

For example writing blogs, Now its possible to use AI to generate headlines and write a long form article at any velocity you choose to depending on the budget. Now we will need an interface where a human can quickly review and adjust content to make it either accurate, authentic etc All the CMS UI interfaces are optimized for writing and not editing.\nThats where a new UI paradigm will have to be discovered to achieve that. reply",

          "text": "I have been on this exact same quest and train of thought recently. I agree with almost everything you say about current UI elements sticking around. However, I do strongly feel that UI may be on the brink of a new revolution and we just don't know how it's gonna look and who's working on it. Xerox Alto was the first GUI ever (ironically I chatgpted that in a text based interaction :D) and the leap from text to GUI was really not that obvious either I would think. I think we're in the text based computer era now and can't just know exactly where we will be in the next few years. Now here's my crazy idea that will likely put me in a mental category: I think the ultimate \"UI\" will be intuition. It's not that I ask an AI to do something or fetch whatever I want. It's the act of just having constant access to all information and action subconsciously. Now for that you'd have to wait until Elon plants a chip in everyone or someone comes up with a less dystopian device :D If you ever get to more clear answers to your questions please do share.

But then we’re at this weird inflection point too where you can’t really have just more of the same be the answer. Everyone kind of agrees that chat which is being used for pretty much everything right now, is nonoptimal user experience for most use cases. And yet that’s what we’re doing. We don’t really know any better. Even agents that will take 15 minutes and then come back to you they’ll summarize a bunch of stuff along the way. That’s considered, like, good UX practices. That’s the best practice right now. Using using a small model to summarize a thinking models reasoning, as you go so that the user knows that while it’s waiting, things are actually happening. So I think If anything, whatever is next becomes something new. And therefore it’s gonna be hard for AI in its current form, LLM driven m to solve for it.

You can find a bunch of ideas online for how to adequately communicate. For me, async + remote engineering teams are the most joyous and exciting setups!

Talk to each other about non-work things and it'll be easier to talk about work things. Scrum has been a way to force people to communicate, but absolutely don't rely on it. There's all these research that tells us that using AI for essays makes you lazy. But in the same form, if you only talk to colleagues during the enforced scrum meeting slots, the team will find it difficult to communicate. Ask each other for life advice and all that. Get used to doing it in messages. Somehow people will only talk to their boss about pizza dough in an office but not online, but that's what the #random channel is for. reply",

It's also not recommended for those who dislike being home all day. - In a remote setup, you either need to already know what you’re doing or be fully prepared to manage yourself. We don’t know you personally and can’t offer much direct help. But based on your post, it sounds like you’re capable of figuring it out. This isn’t rocket science—just be direct with your team, ask the same questions you’ve raised here, and don’t hesitate to request support when needed. Of course, like everyone already said, communicate and communicate. - Keep in mind that remote roles can become problematic if you have family, kids, or pets who are going to interrupt you every 30 minutes—there’s often little you can do to control those distractions. reply",

          "text": "+1 to this. I was in one situation for too long. The problem for anybody in this situation is that finding a new job is hard. If you're not the type of person that interviews well or is great on paper, then the trick to pulling off the switcheroo is to focus on making great relationships now as much as anything. There are many ways to hop on to a new rail, you just have to know that it's the right decision. Don't be a hero in the organization. In the past job. I essentially took over my manager by consistently outshining them. Then they made some unforced errors and I took advantage of the moment, made a political move, and forced their displacement. It was a distinctly unpleasant experience and something I took no glee from doing. Moreover, if you look at the grand scheme of things, nobody remembers that, and you're neither a hero to yourself nor those around you for it. It was a year or two I could have spent finding a productive, healthy, and more facilitating organization. reply",

Dont let this happen to you. Practically, plan your exit. Build your network within the org and outside of it. Keep up with those coffee chats and casual zoom meetups. Remain friendly to others in the org. Cultivate a skill or expertise outside of your current role that could be a stepping stone out of the org.

They believe that they have to act in a certain way.

All are generalities and can be ignored if certain specifics override them, so use your judgment. - If your employer is doing well, it is better to stay longer and get promoted from within.  (Based on \"Relatively good one\" I'll assume this is the case.) - If your employer reorganizes frequently, is supports the \"Stick it out case.\" - If your employer encourages people to find their own new jobs within the company, that is usually the best route.  (This isn't always the situation.  In many companies you need your current boss's blessing)  Based on your explanation it seems like this isn't the case. - If you are learning a lot, add that to the case to stay. - If your new manager has ethical issues (as opposed to just competence issues) start your search right now.  Not 30 minutes from now.  Not tomorrow.  Not next week.  Now. - Same if you're put on any kind of performance improvement plan (PIP).  Don't think \"I'm competent, I can work my way out of it\".  PIPs are paper trails to keep them from getting sued.  Consider the duration of the PIP to be your severance. - As you've figured out, it's rarely a good idea to go over your manager's head unless you have an outstanding relationship with the CEO or similar who would ask you later \"Why didn't you come to me first?\" - If you have to leave, find a new job first.  Then be professional on the way out, and don't throw your manager under the bus.  Just say, \"I really enjoyed working for you, a dream opportunity came up.\"  You never know when they'll be asked for a back-door reference check on you. - Similarly, don't badmouth your boss when you interview.

It’s almost always easier to get promoted by changing jobs where you control the narrative than try to go through the internal process.  Besides that because of salary compression, you usually get paid less even after a promotion than someone coming in at that level.  Yes this is true at FAANG size companies too. reply",

I've done it, and had it done to me. In all cases it worked out decently well. Sometimes the manager saw what I was doing and let me have freer reign. Everyone won.

          "text": "This is a deeply frustrating and energy-draining situation. Thank you for sharing it so candidly. The fact that your motivation has taken a hit is a completely natural and valid response to poor leadership. You are not the problem here. I'm a founder based in Seoul, so I can't comment on the specifics of US corporate culture or the internal politics at your company. However, I believe the framework for making a decision in such a situation is universal. When I or my team members have faced difficult career choices, I've found it helpful to analyze it through three lenses: 1. The Learning Lens: Are you still growing?\nDespite your manager, are you still acquiring valuable skills and experiences that you couldn't easily get elsewhere? Is the work itself still challenging you in a positive way? 2. The Mission Lens: Do you still believe?\nYou said you still care about the mission. The question is, how much? Is your belief in the mission and the product strong enough to endure this manager for another 6, 12, or 18 months? Can you still find a way to contribute effectively to that mission? 3. The Life Lens: What is the daily cost?\nThis is the most important question. What is the daily tax this situation is imposing on your mental and emotional health? Is this cost sustainable over time? Is the person you are becoming in this environment—perhaps more cynical or stressed—someone you respect? No one on the internet can answer these questions for you. My only advice is this: take an hour, write down your honest answers to these three questions. Don't decide today. Put the paper away, and read your own words again in a week. Often, seeing your own thoughts written down, separate from the daily frustration, makes the path forward surprisingly clear. Ultimately, your career is long, but your life is happening now. Your well-being is the most important asset you have. Making a conscious choice for yourself, whatever that may be, is a victory in itself. Wishing you clarity. reply",

          "text": "I have experienced similar situations in the past. \nThe first advice that I could give to you is: don't act instinctively. Wait, understand how the situation is going and then develop a plan. I left a company for a terrible C-level manager (probably the most obnoxiuos and incompetent person that I ever met in my life) and then she was fired during my resignation period. The second advice is: fight only a battle that you can win, otherwise adapt yourself. If your manager is approachable, talk with him in a polite and propositive way and tell him that you will work better without micromanagement, if you need more communication, ask for weekly 1-1, etc. \nIf your manager is not approachable or touchy, avoid the criticism and beat him with their own weapons: he is micromanaging and this has an impact over the projects? Do what is saying and then if the projects are failing, point the responsability to his choiches. This require a lot of social skills and organization to cover your ass, but it's probably the best way to dismantle a terrible manager. Otherwise you can leave, but leaving could be always problematic and require time. But the main advice is: figure out a way to push the stress, the pressure out of you and don't lose mental energy on that. reply",

          "text": "Learning how to form a relationship with your skip is a valuable but undertaught skill. You have to understand that a) There is no \"objective\" standard by which a manager can be evaluated as good or bad b) You are not in a position to determine whether your manager is \"good\" or \"bad\", only whether they are a good or bad fit for you . The person who determines whether your manager is good or bad is your skip. Good managers are the ones that get retained and considered for promotion, bad managers are the ones who are slated for demotion or firing. It doesn't matter if a manager does things counter to every management best practice, if they consistently get promoted, they're a \"good\" manager. If you don't like that, you should consider working for a company where this doesn't typically happen. How you deal with a manager that is not a good fit for you is to determine how much political capital they have within the organization. If they're there to do the job the company wants them to do but you simply don't fit into the larger objectives, then you need to accept that for what it is and understand that the purpose of a system is what it does. However, if you understand that they don't have as much political power as they would seem to let on, then you have a lot more room to maneuver. It's possible to work with the skip to transfer you to a different team because the skip values retaining you more than they value keeping that manager happy. It's also possible though risky to help build the case for the skip that this manager was not the right fit and should be helped to find a different position, possibly at another firm which would be more suited to their skills. Skips don't have visibility into the day to day workings of a manager so understanding what a skip needs to build their case and how you can be an ally in the documentation can be a valuable function you can serve. But ultimately, these are both lower probability scenarios and you should be preparing as a likely contingency for your exit from the company and finding a manager more suited to you. reply",

Disassociate your value from the value of your work. Eventually, you should find something better but the best you can do in the meantime is be respectful and do the work you are assigned without sticking ypur neck out. What tends to happen normally is you either work twice as hard to do the job as you want to do it AND meet your manager's random demands, or you feel like shit for not meeting your manager's demands, or you eat shit because of how they are feeling that day or whatever other nonsense a bad manager may dump on you. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said: \"No one can make you feel bad without your permission.\" So the first step is to put on some thick skin. And I am talking about a bad manager kind of like how people talk about handling a bully. Because, without much context, I know that they have power over you and that you fundamentally disagree with then. So don't try to change them and don't change yourself. This is the only sane way to move forward without burning out quickly or feeling like shit all the time. Best of luck. reply",

          "text": "I’m in a similar position. Old manager was new, first time manager. Not bad but not great. Now we have a new manager who is neurotic and emotionally immature: micromanages everything, attacks their own people for perceived slights, technically mediocre but wants to contribute code/direction, has to have the final say on everything. I’ve been a manager myself. Some people think I was great at it and the best manager they ever had. Others probably didn’t think highly of me. You can’t please everyone. If you feel comfortable with this person and have good reason to believe they can take feedback: give it. You’re probably not without leverage as long as you’re known to do good work. If they’re a manager worth half their salt they will support you. Be constructive and assertive with your feedback. Let them know what behaviours are causing problems for you and what you need to change. You might be surprised by the exchange. These things can have positive outcomes. If you don’t feel comfortable with giving feedback to this person then start a folder with their name. Screenshot every important conversation. If they have specific demands of you try and get them in writing and document what you agree to. Be petty. Out manager them. Then you can go to your skip manager and you can point out the behaviours and provide evidence for their impact on your productivity/career progression/etc. It doesn’t help everyone in all situations but keeping a folder of letters to this person that you will never send can help blow off some steam. It might also help, in the long run, to read over them. Sometimes relationships change for the better and you might not be so angry about things that happened today as you were back then. Emotional regulation and maturity are useful tools. Don’t let them get you angry. Hopefully this folder gets fewer entries over time. Lastly if there is no hope then what you do next might depend on your personal situation. If you’re young and have no dependents, mortgage, etc then it’s a lot easier to find a new gig and quit ASAP. If you have the financial runway quit right away. The next gig might be 100x better but you’ll never know if you don’t take the leap. If you’re not young or have other reasons that require you to have a stable income then you need to hunker down. Compartmentalize: leave your job at the office. Don’t go to happy hours, don’t volunteer extra work, etc. You’re there to fulfill your contractual obligations for money and benefits because people depend on you. It really helps to have a reason outside of work to keep going: friends, family, a hobby, aspirations to start your own business some day, etc. Write down that goal, the plan, etc and remind yourself of it every day. Then show up and do exactly what it required of you to the best of your abilities. Go Star Trek with it. Offer your suggestions when asked but row with the team when your manager chooses the direction. Bad idea and they ignore your advice? It’s their bed to lie in. You’re here for the money not to feel good or have your way. You go in the direction you’re asked to go. You’re in this with the team. That’s it. Worst case scenario: you’re burning out, being abused, don’t feel safe or threatened: get support and get out. Also might help to get a career coach/therapist. Someone you can sound off with. reply",

What parent suggests is akin to feeding your kids sweets to prevent them from throwing a tantrum. I'd go for\n1) look for another position to cover for worst case\n2) keep raising concerns in a professional way, but do as told, while documenting clearly who is responsible for the bad decision.\n3) when speaking criticism about the manager to others, speak about the decision, not the person - let them figure out who's responsible by themselves. speak in terms the business people understand: retention rate, lost revenue, missed timelines, exploding budgets etc. - no bad manager ever got fired for  \"bad code\" or \"doing too much micromanaging\" >  It's right morally. You're trying to do good to the people around you. It's right in pragmatic terms, too, because it may work, and if it doesn't, you can still leave. Morals cannot prosper as a one way road though. \"If you treat me as a resource, I'll treat you as a paycheck\" is a proportionate response to this kind of situation. My higher-up is not at work to spread human values and love at the workplace, they are hired to make the business money. So am I. We both wouldn't be here but for the pay. They won't think twice to throw me under the bus if it helps them or the business. You talking about morals in the workplace seems like you never realized this circumstance. tl;dr Imo the way to go in such a situation is either leave at the next opportunity or work to get rid of them (and be very careful not to endanger yourself in the process!) reply",

I'll even try at some risk of my own job (because if it doesn't work, I was going to be out the door anyway). The rest of what you said I agree with.  That's about how I'd handle it. reply",

Tip: Don't run away from these problems because you only run into them again. Communication is key. I have communicated \"feelings\" in various ways and gestures. Micromanagement? Respond with sarcastic comment \"wow so specific, good thing I left my brain at home today\". Lack of vision? Respond with \"after a few runs in circles trying to find our way, we will eventually get there ... eventually\". Next, master a little bit of psych. \"other half seems like playing along\" tells me they are fawning while the first half are either freeze, fight, or flight but mostly freeze response also known as deer-headlight response. This person might have insecurity issues. This person might be distracted with grandeur of rank. The best way to work with them is come up with a few praises to keep them calm (like how Trump's people keep him calm). Third, let go of your ideas and ambitions and \"leave your brain at home\".  This manager might be dimwitted but eventually the person will get smarter and you will get a first row seat to this adventure. Fourth, find power plays to make this person behave better. Five, and this is the most important ... be LOYAL and let this person know you have their back. Let them know that each personal advantage of yours will be used to support the team. When you see something wrong, whisper to them and let them know. But if this person is family, and/or this person takes advantage of you, then none of my tips work because it only works on people who want to maintain their reputation. The person I work with wants to impress me and gets anxiety attacks when I know the person lacks a few skills. reply",

Now this same person has wife and kids.  The only thoughts that come from this is hopelessness. In this hopelessness, minute incremental improvements is a huge world of difference. Communication, even snarkiness, will shake things. Praise will keep situations cool. Providing Safety will keep your opportunities open. I fundamentally believe that these three things at least will allow for improvements in the person. As for your points, suffering through pain (coming from a superior or subordinate, or the environment) will make it worse, either hardening the heart or tearing it down. That is where mastering the psychology of the oppressor comes in. Knowing who you work with helps to cope with the pressure. Think of it as knowing the bully so you won’t get bullied. Retribution is not the intention, just communication. Communicate the full problem no matter how difficult it may be. And if the problem is with the person themselves, make it humorous. Codependency makes two people similar in nature. This would be the opposite of improvement. On reflecting on my comment, I think it was a bit rushed and did not go fully in depth.

He had a wife and child, so chose income stability over optimal work environment for reasons I am sure you can relate.  It made me sad the things he had to put up with, but I understand why he did.

          "text": "I'm not sure how far along you are in your career, so maybe you are just realizing this:  Most managers are bad at what they do.  It's probably an 80/20 split of net-negative to net-positive managers. e.g. Everything speeds up when they go on vacation, or get sick. The 80% of bad managers thrive in the ambiguity of their performance.  They want to touch processes, and projects, and meetings and schedules, and things, to get their fingerprints on as much stuff as possible, without making a change substantive enough that it could make things noticeably worse.  That way they can say they had an effect, but without the risk of a change that could backfire. If you and a bunch of coworkers politely ask to transfer teams (not all at once), but spread out over a few weeks.  Management will usually scramble to figure out which of their changes was actually impactful in the wrong way.  Your boss doesn't know what he's doing, upper management doesn't either.  They just want the big salary, and the diffuse responsibility. Put yourself in their shoes:  You're in charge of a team, you can't even really tell how it's going because it's just beyond your skillset, and now there are a bunch of people who don't like working on the team.  Or the guy above him:  You moved things around, and now it turns out one of your managers totally dropped the ball on the new team, and now you have to do extra work to retain and move people.
